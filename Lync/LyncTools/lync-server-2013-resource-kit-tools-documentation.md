_**Topic Last Modified:** 2014-01-09_

This topic describes the tools that are part of the Lync Server 2013 Resource Kit, including the purpose of each tool, and examples of its use.The Lync Server 2013, Resource Kit Tools help to make routine tasks easier for IT administrators who deploy and manage Lync Server 2013. For example, the **Web Conf Data** tool can be used to easily control data that is uploaded by users during an online meeting. The **SEFAUtil** tool can be used to set up delegate call forwarding and answering for users. We encourage IT administrators to use these tools to more effectively manage Lync Server 2013.

<div>

## Installation of the Resource Kit Tools

To install the Lync Server 2013, Resource Kit Tools, download **OCSReskit.msi**. You can download the Resource Kit Tools installer from the Download Center at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=330429](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=330429).

Run **OCSResKit.msi** to do a simple installation. The .msi installs all the tools in the following path: **%Program Files%\\Microsoft Lync Server 2013\\ResKit**. Tools that are self-contained executables are in this folder. Tools that also have files are in their own subfolders.

</div>

<div>

## Supported Environments

For optimal performance, the Lync Server 2013, Resource Kit Tools should be installed in the same environment and with the same specifications that are required for Lync Server 2013.

</div>

<div>

## ABSConfig

The Address Book Service Configuration tool (ABSConfig) is an administrative tool that helps administrators customize Address Book Service configuration in Lync Server 2013. This tool also enables Lync Server 2013 administrators to restore the default Address Book Service settings.

<div>

## Description

ABSConfig is a graphical user interface application that enables administrators to configure Active Directory Domain Services attributes that are related to Address Book Service.

The primary scenarios for the tool are the following:

  - To enable administrators to map attributes in Active Directory Domain Services to the attributes for Lync Server 2013.

  - To enable administrators to specify the Active Directory Domain Services attribute to be included or excluded in the Address Book Service files.

  - To enable administrators to restore default Address Book Service settings.

The ABSConfig tool can be started by using the absConfig.exe file. The tool opens to the **Configure Attributes** tab. This table has options to map Active Directory Domain Services attributes to the attribute fields for Lync Server 2013 and to specify which users to include or exclude in Address Book Service files based on specific attribute filters. It also has options to customize which value of the phone number to be included in the Address Book file. The **Restore Defaults** option enables administrators to restore Address Book Service settings to default values.

</div>

<div>

## Changes from Lync Server 2010

In Lync Server 2013 ABS Configuration tool, attributes (rows) may be removed by unchecking the “enable” checkbox for the attribute. This has the same effect as deleting the row in Lync Server 2010.

<div>


> [!NOTE]  
> The enable checkbox is in the far right column; you may need to scroll right to see the column



</div>

</div>

<div>

## Output

ABSConfig stores the Address Book Service configuration in the database.

    Path: %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Lync Server 2013\Reskit

<div>

## Bandwidth Policy Service Monitor

The Bandwidth Policy Service Monitor tool is intended to allow administrators to view a list of the following:

1.  All the configured Lync Server 2013 Bandwidth Policy services (Authentication and Core) in the topology

2.  The connections that each service makes to other Bandwidth Policy services and to the Edge servers

3.  All the links that are configured in the Network configuration document and real-time bandwidth usage as reported by each of the Bandwidth Policy services

<div>

## Description

The Bandwidth Policy Service Monitor tool is implemented as a GUI-based application. Administrators start the tool by running PDPMonUI.exe.

When the tool starts, it attempts to discover the list of Bandwidth Policy services in the topology. After the initial update is done, the pane to the left of the window is populated with a list of services that are grouped by the clusters that they belong to.

When administrators select a particular Bandwidth Policy Service, the pane on the right displays the information about that particular service. That pane also has two main tabs that display information.

<div>

## Machine Info Tab

The **Machine Info** tab shows the details of the Bandwidth Policy Service that is selected and the list and state of all the connections that are made by the selected Bandwidth Policy Service to other services.

</div>

<div>

## Topology Info Tab

The **Topology Info** tab shows a list of all the links that are configured in the Network configuration settings. For each link, the audio and video bandwidth capacity is displayed. Additionally, the currently utilized bandwidth is displayed, both in Kbps and as a percentage of the capacity. The tool uses color-coding to highlight links that have utilization that is close to the capacity—this allows administrators to quickly isolate such links.

<div>


> [!NOTE]  
> If the Bandwidth Policy Service Monitor tool experiences failure when it connects to any of the configured Bandwidth Policy services, the information in the <STRONG>Machine Info</STRONG> and the <STRONG>Topology Info</STRONG> tabs won’t be populated. However, it is possible that the tool might connect initially but subsequently lose its connection to the service. In such cases, administrators might see outdated information. There is a <STRONG>Last Updated</STRONG> time stamp on each of the tabs that can allow administrators to see when the data was last updated for a particular Bandwidth Policy Service.



</div>

</div>

</div>

<div>

## Output

There is no command-line output; the program output is contained within the main graphical user interface (GUI).

</div>

<div>

## Purpose

The purpose of the Bandwidth Policy Service Monitor tool is to allow administrators visibility into the state of each of the Bandwidth Policy services that are defined in the topology. In addition, administrators can see real-time bandwidth usage for all the links that are defined in the Network configuration document.

</div>

<div>

## Requirements

The Bandwidth Policy Service Monitor tool needs to be run on a computer that is part of the Lync Server topology.

</div>

<div>

## Summary

The Bandwidth Policy Service Monitor tool can be a valuable resource to administrators so they can inspect the state of all the Bandwidth Policy services in the topology—and more importantly—they can obtain real-time bandwidth utilization for the links that are defined in the Network configuration settings.

</div>

</div>

<div>

## Bandwidth Utilization Analyzer

Bandwidth Utilization Analyzer is a tool that creates reports about various views of bandwidth consumption by the UC endpoints across WAN links in the enterprise network. These reports can be used to understand the current bandwidth consumption pattern and to aid in bandwidth capacity planning.

<div>

## Description

Bandwidth Utilization Analyzer is implemented as a GUI-based application. This tool generates reports specifically for audio utilization across the network and helps with capacity planning. It also iterates on the bandwidth capacity that is assigned to various links.

</div>

<div>

## Output

Bandwidth Utilization Analyzer provides graphic al plots of bandwidth capacity and utilization for audio for all the WAN links that are configured in the system.

</div>

<div>

## Purpose

In any voice and video deployment, it’s critical to monitor and understand the trend of bandwidth utilization of media traffic across the enterprise network. The Bandwidth Utilization Analyzer tool allows an administrator to achieve just that. This tool does the following:

  - Generates specific reports for audio utilization across the network

  - Helps with more effective capacity planning and iteration on the bandwidth capacity that is assigned to various links

Bandwidth Utilization Analyzer can generate graphical plots of bandwidth capacity and utilization reports; they are as follows:

  - All the WAN links in the enterprise network

  - Filtered by selected WAN links that have been chosen

  - Filtered by WAN links that have exceeded link capacity

  - Filtered by WAN links that have been under-utilizing the provisioned bandwidth

  - Filter by WAN links that have been reaching critical levels (a bandwidth utilization that is greater than 90% of bandwidth capacity of the WAN link)

  - Filtered by WAN link type—network-site links, interregional links, and links within a site

  - Filtered by network region

<div>

## Applications

Bandwidth Utilization Analyzer has the following two applications (tools):

  - **WanLinkLogCollector.exe**   This tool enables its user to input the required information.

  - **BandwidthUtilizationAnalyzer.xlsm**  A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet software report is automatically launched by WanLinkLogCollector.exe. This application allows the user to apply filters to the report as shown later in this article.

</div>

<div>

## Phases of Using Bandwidth Utilization Analyzer

There are two phases when using Bandwidth Utilization Analyzer:

  - Collect logs, which is performed by using WanLinkLogCollector.exe

  - Customize reports, which is performed by using BandwidthUtilizationAnalyzer.xlsm

<div>


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> We strongly recommend that BandwidthUtilizationAnalyzer.xlsm not be manually launched by end users.



</div>

</div>

<div>

## Starting Bandwidth Utilization Analyzer

Start WanLinkLogCollector.exe at the command prompt or by using Windows Explorer.

**Using WanLinkLogCollector.exe**

There are three steps to using WanLinkLogCollector.exe:

1.  **Log the timeline**   Provide the timeline that the report needs to be generated for

2.  **Specify the file directories**   Provide file location information

3.  **Collect the logs and launch the report viewer**  Execute the command to generate the report

<div>

## Step 1 - Log the timeline

Logging the timeline allows the tool user to specify the following as shown in the figure below.

1.  **Start date** This is the start date of the timeline that the report is to be generated for; for example, August 1, 2010.

2.  **End date** This is the end date of the timeline that the report is to be generated for; for example, September 30, 2010.
    
    ![Start and End dates in the Bandwidth Utilization A](images/JJ945604.2c597cfc-3372-4d41-816b-26202f607ad8(OCS.15).jpg "Start and End dates in the Bandwidth Utilization A")  

</div>

<div>

## Step 2 - Specify the file directories

The following file directories can be specified by the user as shown.

  - **Server log files location** The folder location where Bandwidth policy server logs are stored. This is typically in \<fileserver\>\\\<choice of FE\>\\AppServerFiles\\PDP.

  - **Temporary file storage location** The temporary file location where intermediate files are stored while the report is being generated.

![File directories in the Bandwidth Utilization Anal](images/JJ945604.d66daeac-1669-45e3-932d-3f6782840c2a(OCS.15).jpg "File directories in the Bandwidth Utilization Anal")

<div>


> [!NOTE]  
> Ensure that sufficient file access to the server logs and the temporary file store folder is provided to the tool user.

## Call Parkometer

Call Parkometer is a command-line application that provides easy access to the Call Park orbit database.

<div>

## Description

Call Parkometer is a tool to track currently parked calls. It also collects statistics about orbits and Call Park Server (CPS) usage. This command-line tool provides both read and write-access to the CPS orbit SQL Server database from a local or remotely connected computer.

All options are mutually exclusive. Command-line syntax is as follows:

  - **–o** parameter—lists all orbit ranges configured for this pool.

  - **–n** parameter—lists all currently used orbits in this pool. The information displayed is as follows:
    
      - SIP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of the parkee and parker.
    
      - Host name of the CPS where the call is parked.
    
      - Time stamp of when the call was parked.

  - **–f** parameter—lists the number of currently free orbits in the pool.

  - **–r \<n\>** parameter—lists the \<n\> last parked calls. The information displayed is as follows:
    
      - Parkee SIP URI.
    
      - Parker SIP URI.
    
      - Host name of the CPS where the call was parked.
    
      - Time stamp of when the call was retrieved or dropped.

  - **-t\<n\>** parameter - tests reserving an orbit in the database to show the randomness of the assigned orbit numbers.

</div>

<div>

## Output

Depending on the input parameters that are specified at a command prompt, Call Parkometer displays the following output:

  - All orbit ranges that are configured for this pool

  - Currently parked calls

  - Number of free (available) orbits

  - Recently parked calls

  - Reserved orbits for testing uniform and random orbit values

</div>

<div>

## Purpose

The purpose of the CPS tool is to provide command-line access to the CPS database. The administrator can view the CPS usage and determine the number of orbits assigned to a pool.

</div>

<div>

## Requirements

There are no requirements if this tool is run on the same computer that is running CPS. If this tool is run on a remote computer, the SQL Server database used by Lync Server 2013 must be configured to allow remote access. Call Parkometer must be configured with a SQL Server database connection string to connect to the pool’s SQL Server. This SQL Server database connection string is defined in the configuration file, **parkometer.exe.config**. It must be placed in the same directory where parkometer.exe is located. The following XML file is an example of a parkometer.exe.config. The parameters that must be configured are user name (for example, mydomain\\Administrator), password (for example, mypassword), and host name (for example, myserver).

```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
    <configuration>
      <appSettings>
       <add key="SQL" value="server=myserver\RTC;
    database=cpsdyn;
    User Id=mydomain\Administrator;
    Password=mypassword.;
    Integrated Security=false;"/>
      </appSettings>
    </configuration>
```

</div>

<div>

</div>

</div>

<div>

## CleanupStorageServiceData

The CleanupStorageServiceData resource kit tool allows for deleting of orphaned data from the database used by the Lync Server Storage Service (LYSS). One function of the storage service is to buffer communication between Lync Server and various back-end data storage endpoints, like SQL Server and Exchange.

<div>

## Description

To support high availability, LYSS accepts and saves copies of the data on multiple front end servers in the pool temporarily, and removes that data once it has been delivered to its final long-term storage location. There are unusual situations which may occur during otherwise normal operation, when a server might crash or experience a processing issue, and some data might not get cleaned up properly. This data is harmless, but it does consume limited processing resources. Much of the normal required data maintenance is automated, but this tool allows for the safe identification and removal of such orphaned data when automated removal is not possible. Usage of this tool is indicated when a health monitoring System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) alert is raised which asks the administrator to remove the unneeded data from the local LYSS databases in the pool. There will be a corresponding event in the event log on the front end which triggered the alert. The event details will contain information about the amount of orphaned data contained on the front end, and is raised when that data exceeds certain pre-determine thresholds

</div>

<div>

## Requirements

Install the Lync Server 2013, Resource Kit Tools. The tool runs on domain-joined machines where Lync Server and Lync Server 2013 Management Shell are installed. The tool uses a cmdlet from the management shell to identify all Front End servers in the pool. Secondly, the tool must be executed from a machine in the pool which has the **RtcLocal** database installed. This database is used by the CleanupStorageServiceData tool to get the connection details needed to communicate with the Lync Server Routing Service.Finally, the account or credential invoking the tool must have read/write permission to the file share to which they want to write the output log.Also, this tool depends on the pool being in a stable state. In essence this means that every Front End server is expected to be up and running, the SQL Server LYNCLOCAL instance and LYSS database must be able to be connected to, and each routing group must have a complete set of 1 primary Front End servers and 2 secondary Front End servers.

</div>

<div>

## Examples

C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Lync Server 2013\\ResKit\\StorageService\> ImportStorageServiceData.exe

    Description:
    This tool will remove orphaned data from the Storage Service database
    for a pool. You are required to run this tool on a machine inside the
    pool which has the Lync Server Management Shell installed and has RtcLocal database installed.
    Usage: Default behavior is to clean up orphaned data from the all the 
           Storage Service databases in the current pool.
    Additional Options:
    -Verbose    : Turn verbose output on.
    -LogPath    : The UNC path to which to write the log.

## DBAnalyze

<div>

## Description

DBAnalyze is a command-line tool that helps administrators to gather analysis reports about the Lync Server 2013 databases. DBAnalyze has the following modes: diagnostic, user data, conference, MCUs, and disk fragmentation:

  - **Diagnostic mode**   Creates a report that includes information about tables (number of records, fragmentation, data size, and index size), data and log file sizes, the last back-up time, contact distribution among servers that are running Microsoft Office Communications Server, the average number of permissions, contacts, containers, subscriptions, publications, endpoints per user, any improperly homed users, users that can’t be routed, the average number of conferences organized per user, scheduled conferences, active conferences, and the database version.
    
    <div>
    

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Running diagnostic mode can affect server performance.

    
    </div>

  - **User data mode**  Reports contact, container, subscription, publication, permission, and contact-group data for a specified user or for users who have that user in their contact and permission lists. This mode also reports summary data for conferences that a user organizes or is invited to.

  - **Conference mode**   Reports detailed data for a specific conference, including all schedule-time details for the conference, the invitee list, the list of media types allowed for the conference, active MCUs (multipoint control units), the active participant list, and each participant’s signaling state.

  - **Decode Meeting ID**  Decodes a public switched telephone network (PSTN) meeting ID that is specified by the **/pstnid** switch but does not connect to the back end for detailed information.

  - **Resolve conference**   Decodes a PSTN meeting ID that is specified by the **/pstnid** switch and displays information about the conference indicated by the ID.

  - **MCUs mode**  Reports the ID, media type, URL, heartbeat status, conference load, and participant load for each MCU in the pool.

  - **Disk fragmentation mode**  Displays the fragmentation status of all disks.

This tool can be used to diagnose various problems or to assist administrators with capacity planning. For example, if most of the users homed on server A choose users homed on server B as their contacts, the administrator can move the users on server A to server B to reduce cross-server traffic.

## ImportStorageServiceData

The ImportStorageServiceData resource kit tool allows for re-importing Queue and Endpoint data that was flushed out of the Storage Service (LYSS) back into the Storage Service.

<div>

## Description

The data flushed out of the Storage Service could have been automatic (periodic) based on Queue Item status or database size. It could have happened due to the manual invocation of the pool failover cmdlet, or the StorageServiceFullFlush cmdlet (which the pool failover cmdlet invokes). Note that data should ideally not be re-imported if any of the Storage Service (LYSS ) database size on the front ends is above the normal level, because doing so will likely just cause more data to be exported back out. Furthermore, any problems which could have contributed to errors that caused the Storage Service Queue to grow should first be resolved (for example Exchange endpoint errors, network issues, or other problems).

**Scenario 1:** during pool failover, files may be flushed out from storage service for each front end. After failover is completed, the tool should be run to re-import the data.

**Scenario 2:** data is being flushed automatically each day or in response to Storage Service database exceeding certain size thresholds ( for example 60%, 80%, 90% full ). This automatically flushed data should be re-imported routinely by the administrator. In the above situation, if the monitoring SCOM pack is not deployed, there are events for Lync Server Storage Service relating to data being flushed from the Storage Service. Event IDs of 32075 (full flush operation is started), 32076 (full flush has completed), 32082 (maintenance level flush started), 32083 (maintenance level flush complete), 32089 (flush occurred due to filling up of database). Note these event Ids correspond to the RTM release. When an administrator sees these events, it means that there are files that have been flushed out. This data should routinely be imported back using this tool, for example once per week.

For the Online Service release, if health monitoring SCOM pack for Lync Server is deployed, there are new alerts which may be raised which ask the administrator to re-import the flushed data back into Storage Service. There will be a corresponding event in the event log on the Front End server which triggered the alert. The event will give a description of the Parent path under which the flushed data files are located, as well as how many files there are which meet the alert criteria. The alert criteria is that there are X or more files under the particular parent path which are at least Y days old ( where X and Y are preset within the StorageService but can be overridden by changing the APPCONFIG file.)Two examples of events which can trigger the health alert are shown below, with the difference being their parent path. One possibility is under Web service file share, while the other possibility is the local Application Data directory of each front end. ( for example c:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Lync Server\\StorageService ). The administrator will then run this reskit tool.

This tool will increase CPU and IO load on the front end it is running on, as well as other front ends, in the situation that the data is not owned by the front end that the tool is executed on. We recommend runng this tool when front ends are not under heavy CPU and IO load, for example outside of peak hours. Secondly, this tool can 2 to 3 minutes to import one data file. Keep this in mind when estimating how long tool will be running.The verbose log file generated by the tool will by default appear on the File Store. Delete it if there are no errors reported, because the log file can be tens of MB or more.

![Sample Storage Server event log events.](images/JJ945604.3a903ef7-ea8a-4606-8229-a3e32f13af3a(OCS.15).jpg "Sample Storage Server event log events.")

</div>

<div>

## Requirements

Install the Lync Server 2013, Resource Kit Tools. The tool runs on domain-joined machines where Lync Server and Lync Server Management Shell are installed. The tool uses a cmdlet from the management shell to identify all the Front End servers in the pool. Secondly, the tool must be executed from a machine in the pool which has the **RtcLocal** database installed. This database is used by the tool to retrieve the location of the WEBSERVICE file share for the pool.Additionally, before using the tool, each Front End server must first enable Windows PowerShell Remoting using **Enable-PSRemoting** on each Front End server, as well as the machine that the tool is executed from. Otherwise, remote Windows PowerShell commands from this tool will fail. Windows PowerShell Remoting can be turned off on all Front End servers in the pool after it is finished. Finally, the account or credential invoking the tool must have read/write permission to the webservice file share for the pool they are executing this tool on. Otherwise the tool will fail with IO Permission errors.

<div>


> [!NOTE]  
> On Windows Server 2012, Windows PowerShell Remoting is enabled by default, but not on the Windows Server 2008 operating system.

## Examples

    >  C:\StorageService>ImportStorageServiceData.exe
    Description:
    This tool will re-import Storage Service (LYSS) flushed queue data back in.  For a pool: you are required to run this tool on a machine inside the pool which has the Lync Server Management Shell installed.  Additionally, all front end machines need to have Windows Powershell Remoting enabled before executing this tool by executing Enable-PSRemoting.  Also, please ensure that all Storage Service instance DB Size are at the 'Normal' level (verify this by viewing Eventlog events). Otherwise re-importing may cause data to be flushed out again if any Storage Service instance DB size level goes above 'Normal'.
    Usage: Default behavior is to Import data from web service file share as well as any files on all Front End machines in pool.
    Additional Options:
    -Verbose                    : Turn verbose output on.
    
    -StorageServiceHostName     : Host Name of Storage Service WCF endpoint.  ( Default=localhost netnamedpipe binding. )
                                        
    -FileSharePath              : Import only all data from just under the UNC path specified.
    
    ActivityID: cc3b62ff-bb66-4e61-a6e2-96cb3626315c. <-- Use this to correlate with StorageService trace logs if troubleshooting.

## LCSSync

The LCSSync tool helps to deploy Lync Server 2013 communications software in a multi-forest environment. This tool is used to synchronize users and groups from different user forests as an Active Directory Domain Services contact object to a central forest where Lync Server 2013 is installed.

<div>

## Description

LCSSync uses the synchronized Active Directory Domain Services contact objects in the central forest to enable users for Lync Server. To provide single sign-in, the primary user account must be mapped to the Active Directory Domain Services contact object in the central forest for Lync Server 2013. This tool helps perform that mapping. This tool provides templates for creating Management Agents in the Microsoft Identity Integration Server.

## Network Configuration Viewer

Network Configuration Viewer can be used by Microsoft Lync Server 2013 communications software administrators to view call admission control (CAC) network topology for an enterprise that is provisioned to allow real-time communication sessions, such as voice or video calls based on specified bandwidth capacity. Lync Server 2013 administrators define CAC policies, which are enforced by the Bandwidth Policy services that are installed with Lync Server 2013.

<div>

## Description

Network Configuration Viewer (NetworkConfigurationViewer.exe) allows administrators to perform the following tasks:

  - Load and view CAC network topology from a Lync Server 2013 deployment in a graphical format.

  - Load and view CAC network topology from a Bandwidth Policy Server log file in a graphical format.

  - Save and store CAC network topology in an XML format on the disk.

  - Save and store CAC network topology diagram in JPG or BMP format.

  - View CAC network topology configuration data.

  - View CAC network topology in a tree-view style.

  - Define custom connectors for CAC network topology links (for example, site-to-region, region-to-region, and site-to-site links).

  - View CAC network topology site information, region Information, and provisioned bandwidth policies and network links.

</div>

<div>

## Purpose

View enterprise CAC network topology links in a graphical interface.

</div>

<div>

## Examples

**Load and view CAC network topology from a Lync Server 2013 deployment in a graphical format:** Lync Server 2013 administrators can load and view CAC network topology configuration on any Lync Server 2013 computer by using the **Download Network Configuration** option as shown in the figure below. The tool will fail to download or view such a configuration when deployed on a computer that does not have connectivity to the Lync configuration store.

## Response Group Agent Live

The Response Group application gives agents the ability to access useful real-time information using its built-in Web service. Unfortunately, no graphical view of this data is available outside the application. The Response Group Agent Live Resource Kit tool solves this issue by providing a simple and graphical way to access this information, enhanced with real-time Microsoft Lync 2013 communications software information such as the presence of other agents.

<div>

## Description

Response Group Agent Live is a Windows application that provides sign-in and sign-out functionality and some real-time information (such as group membership and current number of calls) to Response Group agents. It is meant to be an enhanced version of the Agent Groups page (accessible from Lync 2013.

</div>

<div>

## Purpose

The Response Group application queues incoming calls, and then routes them to agent groups. To make informed decisions about which calls to service, agents can access real-time information about their agent groups, such as what other agents are available and how many calls are waiting in each queue. This information, initially accessible only through the Response Group service, is made available in an intuitive way by Response Group Agent Live.

<div>

## Features

The Response Group Agent Live tool is built on the Response Group service and the Microsoft Lync 2013 SDK. It provides Response Group agents the information and capabilities that are available from the Response Group service (such as group membership, presence of other agents, and number of waiting calls).

The figure below illustrates the main interface of Response Group Agent Live.

![The Response Group Agent Live tool.](images/JJ945604.63cb0374-a6ef-4a59-b60e-bec86a880d09(OCS.15).jpg "The Response Group Agent Live tool.")

The following three main features are available for agents in Response Group Agent Live:

  - **Sign-in/out:** Contrary to the Agent Groups page (accessible from Lync 2013), Response Group Agent Live allows only agents to sign-in or out of all agent groups at once. This application provides three quick ways for agents to sign in or out:
    
      - Click the Sign-in/out (green and red) buttons within the application.
    
      - Right-click the system tray icon, and select sign in or sign out.
    
      - Using configurable keyboard shortcuts.

  - **Group membership:** When an agent group is selected, Response Group Agent Live displays the list of agents in this group in the right pane. If Lync 2013 is running on the same computer as this application, presence information and the contact card are displayed in the Response Group Agent Live. Agents can send an IM or call other agents directly from there.

  - **Real-time statistics:** Response Group Agent Live provides real-time statistics for all agent groups. The update frequency is one minute. When a call is answered by a Response Group, a visual indicator is added next to the group name with the current number of queued calls. Pausing the pointer over a group also displays the longest waiting time.

</div>

</div>

<div>

## Requirements

Response Group Agent Live requires the .NET Framework 4.0. In addition, to take advantage of the presence and contact card features, Lync 2013 must be installed locally (and be running).

<div>

## Configuration

Response Group Agent Live can be customized to individual preferences by using the Options dialog box in the application. In addition, the administrator can define the default host address by editing directly the defaultHostAddress property of the RGAgentLive.exe.config file.

The figure below illustrates the Options dialog box that agents can use to configure the host address and shortcut keys. This dialog is accessed by clicking the Options button on the top right of the main interface.

![The Response Group Agent Live Options dialog box.](images/JJ945604.3cc15e29-8699-45ab-90c3-e1565fa6ebf6(OCS.15).jpg "The Response Group Agent Live Options dialog box.")

The following three different settings can be customized in the Response Group Agent Live configuration:

  - Host address: This is typically the web pool FQDN belonging to the agent’s home pool. The exact Response Group service address is automatically derived in the background from this information (by appending the right path after the host).

  - Shortcuts: The exact shortcuts to sign-in/out can be customized. The only limitation is that both shortcuts must contain the “Windows Logo” key (in addition to at least another key).

  - Start with Windows: The application can be configured to start automatically with Windows.

</div>

</div>

<div>

## Examples

The figure below illustrates how to call or send an IM to another agent by right-clicking the contact in the right pane.

![Making a call or sending an IM.](images/JJ945604.009cebe0-5a93-4745-89c3-8a16c7c13009(OCS.15).jpg "Making a call or sending an IM.")

The figure below illustrates how Response Group Agent Live displays the current number of calls in the queue and the longest waiting time among all these incoming calls.

![Viewing queue information.](images/JJ945604.131d7f79-b7ed-41f5-a9da-ffc556e31037(OCS.15).jpg "Viewing queue information.")

</div>

<div>

## Summary

Fast sign-in and sign-out, group membership, and basic real-time statistics are interesting Response Group agent features that are only available outside the application from the Response Group service. With the Response Group Agent Live Resource Kit tool, Lync administrators can provide their agents with a Windows application that allows them to perform tasks in a faster and graphical way.

## SEFAUtil

SEFAUtil (secondary extension feature activation) is a command-line tool that enables Microsoft Lync Server 2013 communications software administrators and helpdesk agents to configure delegate-ringing, call-forwarding, simultaneous ringing, team-call settings and group call pickup on behalf of a Lync Server 2013 user. The tool also allows administrators to query the call-routing settings that are published for a particular user.The SEFAUtil tool allows the administrator to enable/disable/modify call forwarding or simultaneously ringing on behalf of the user. The administrator can specify the target (in the form of a SIP URI) or use a target that has already been published by the user. This tool also allows administrators to add or remove delegates or team-call group members on behalf of the user.This tool is built on Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API (UCMA) 3.0 and requires that administrators create a trusted application in the Central Management store for SEFAUtil

SEFAUtil (secondary extension feature activation) enables Lync Server 2013 administrators and helpdesk agents to configure delegate-ringing, call-forwarding, simultaneous ringing, team-call settings and group call pickup on behalf of a Lync Server 2013 user. This tool also allows administrators to query the call-routing settings that are published for a particular user.

<div>

## Description

The current version of SEFAUtil is only a command-line tool; there is no supporting graphical user interface. This tool is based on Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API (UCMA) 3.0. The features in this tool allow administrators and helpdesk agents to do the following:

  - View all call routing settings for a user (includes call-forwarding, delegation, simultaneous ringing, team-call and group call pickup)

  - Enable/disable/modify call-forwarding setting (includes destination and no-answer timer)

  - Enable/disable/modify call-forwarding immediate configurations

  - Enable/disable/modify delegation settings

  - Enable/disable/modify team-call group settings

    </div>

This tool has the following limitations:

  - Supported only for users homed in a Lync Server pool

  - Bulk-edit of call routing settings for several users is not supported

</div>

<div>

## Output

The current version of this tool provides output only in the Command Prompt window. For details, see the Examples section later in this document.

</div>

<div>

## Purpose

Following are some of the key scenarios where this tool may be used:

  - Bob is an executive and has been moved to Lync Server telephony. He has delegation on his existing PBX system. As part of the move to Lync, the administrator is able to configure Bob’s routing to reflect his pre-existing delegation configuration.

  - Alice is travelling and realizes that she is expecting an important call from one of her customers. However, she is in a hotel and has no access to a computer. She calls the helpdesk and requests that they forward to her mobile number all the calls made to her work number. The helpdesk personnel are able to do the configuration on her behalf.

  - Joe’s calls to his work number are going to his mobile voicemail whenever he is at work; however, things appear to be working correctly in most other locations. The helpdesk technician is able to view Joe’s routing configuration and discovers that Joe has simultaneous ringing configured to his mobile phone. The technician asks Joe about the mobile coverage at his office and is able to determine that the simultaneous ringing rule is what is causing the calls to go to Joe’s mobile voicemail when his network coverage is poor.

  - Mike is a new employee at Contoso and he’s joining a new team on which all members are configured for team-call, when being enabled for Microsoft Lync, the administrator is able to set his team-call group settings to include all his new team members, additionally, the administrator adds Mike as a team-call group member for each of the members in his team.

  - A customer service practice in the human resources department at Contoso is to provide personal service for all callers since the first call. Given that all members of the department sit very close to each other, having all phones ringing at the same time with team-call is very disruptive for the team. To provide the best service without disrupting the team members, the Lync administrator takes advantage of the Group Call Pickup capability. The administrator adds all department members to a pickup group and communicates to the department the pickup group number. When Samantha is absent from her desk, Joe notices her phone ringing and he proceeds to answer the call from his desk.

</div>

<div>

## Requirements

The SEFAUtil tool can be run only on a computer that is a part of a Trusted Application Pool. UCMA 3.0 must be installed on that computer. To run the tool, a new Trusted Application with the SEFAUtil application ID must be created on that pool.

**Creating a new Trusted Application for the SEFAUtil tool**

1.  The SEFAUTil tool can be run only on a computer that is part of a trusted application pool. If needed, adding a pool as a new trusted application pool can be done via the Lync Server Management Shell with the following cmdlet:
    
        New-CsTrustedApplicationPool -id <Pool FQDN> -Registrar <Pool Registrar FQDN> -site Site:<Pool Site>
    
    <div>
    

    > [!NOTE]  
    > UCMA 3.0 must be installed on any computer that will be used to run the SEFAUtil tool.

    
    </div>

2.  A trusted application needs to be defined in the topology for the SEFAUtil tool. To define SEFAUtil as a new trusted application, use the Lync Server Management Shell and execute the following cmdlet:
    
        New-CsTrustedApplication -ApplicationId sefautil -TrustedApplicationPoolFqdn <Pool FQDN>  -Port 7489
    
    <div>
    

    > [!NOTE]  
    > A different port can be used if needed.

    
    </div>

3.  The topology changes need to be enabled. Enabling the topology changes can be done via the Lync Server Management Shell by executing the following cmdlet:
    
        Enable-CsToplogy

4.  If needed, install the Lync Server 2013 Resource Kit Tools in the server that will be used to run the SEFAUtil tool (the server must be part of a trusted application pool).

5.  Verify the SEFAUtil is running correctly. To do this, run the tool from a windows command prompt with administrator privileges to display the call forwarding settings of a user in the deployment. By default the tool will be located in: “…\\Program Files\\Microsoft Lync Server 2013\\Reskit”. To display the call forwarding settings of a user, use the following command:
    
        SEFAUtil.exe <user SIP address> /server:<Lync Server/Pool FQDN>
    
    The call forwarding settings of the user should be displayed.

<div>

## Group Call Pickup

Group Call Pickup requires additional configuration in Lync Server for the capability to be fully enabled. Before assigning pickup groups to users, refer to the Group Call Pickup product documentation for the planning and deployment steps of this capability.

</div>

</div>

<div>

## Examples

<div>

## Display Current Call Handling Settings

The following command displays the call handling for the user. `SEFAUtil.exe /server:lyncserver.contoso.com katarina@contoso.com`

<div>


> [!NOTE]  
> This example uses the <STRONG>/server</STRONG> switch to specify the Lync Server to connect to.



</div>

**Output**

    User Aor: sip:katarina@contoso.com
    Display Name: Katarina Larsson
    UM Enabled: True
    Simulring enabled: False
    User Ring time: 00:00:20
    Call Forward No Answer to: voicemail

</div>

<div>

## Set the Call Forward/No Answer Destination

This example sets the call forward/no answer destination and the ring delay. Here, the /server switch is not provided; SEFAUtil attempts to autodiscover the Lync Server.

    SEFAUtil.exe /server:lyncserver.contoso.com sip:katarina@contoso.com /enablefwdnoanswer /callanswerwaittime:30 /setfwddestination:+1425555 0126@contoso.com;user=phone

**Output**

    User Aor: sip:katarina@contoso.com
    Display Name: Katarina Larsson
    UM Enabled: True
    Simulring enabled: False
    User Ring time: 00:00:30
    Call Forward No Answer to: sip:+14255550126@contoso.com;user=phone

</div>

<div>

## Enable Call Forwarding Immediately

This example immediately enables call-forwarding to another user.

    SEFAUtil.exe sip:katarina@contoso.com /enablefwdimmediate /setfwddestination:anders@contoso.com

## SYSPrep.ps1

<div>

## Description

SYSPrep.ps1 is a Windows PowerShell script that will install the following Lync Server 2013 prerequisites on your Windows Server 2008 operating system machine.

  - Microsoft .Net Framework 4.5

  - Microsoft SQL Server Express

  - Windows Powershell version 3.0

  - Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable

  - Internet Information Server Updates

  - Windows Identity Foundation

  - Lync Server 2013 Core files

While the script name is similar to the System Preparation Tool for the Microsoft Windows operating systems, they are different. This script will only install the required prerequisites for Lync Server 2013. Once those prerequisites are installed, the Windows SYSPrep tool can then be used to create an image of the server.

</div>

<div>

## Requirements

Prior to running the SYSPrep.ps1 script, you must copy the prerequisite files to a local folder on the Windows Server 2008 operating system machine (for example **D:\\Setup)**. This folder must also include a copy of the Lync Server 2013 files, specifically **Setup.exe.** The prerequisite files can be downloaded from the following locations:

## Unassigned Number Announcements Migration

The Unassigned Number Announcements Migration tool enables a Lync administrator to move the unassigned numbers configuration that is serviced by the announcement application from a source Lync Server or Pool to a destination Lync Server or Pool.

<div>

## Description

The Unassigned Number Announcements Migration tool is a Windows PowerShell script that moves the unassigned numbers configuration serviced by the announcement application of a source server or pool to a different server or pool.

When executed, the Unassigned Number Announcements Migration script will perform the following operations:

1.  Move all the audio files used by the unassigned number announcements of the announcement application hosted in the source server or pool to the file store of the destination server or pool.
    
    <div>
    

    > [!NOTE]  
    > the audio files are removed from the source pool once they’re copied to the destination pool.

    
    </div>

2.  Move all unassigned number announcements configured for the announcement application hosted in the source server or pool to the destination server or pool.

3.  Reassign all the unassigned number ranges that are serviced by the announcement application hosted in the source server or pool to the destination server or pool.

After successfully running the script, all the unassigned number ranges that were serviced by the announcement application hosted in the source server or pool will now be serviced with the same configuration by the destination server or pool.

</div>

<div>

## Output

The **Move-CsAnnouncementConfiguration** script indicates in the Lync Management Shell window from where it’s executed the success or failure of the migration operation.

If the execution of the operation is interrupted by any error, the unassigned number ranges that were successfully moved to the destination will remain in the destination in an operational form and the rest of the unassigned number ranges to be migrated will remain in the source as well in an operational form. To fully migrate the rest of the configuration, rerun the script after addressing the error.

</div>

<div>

## Purpose

The Unassigned Number Announcements Migration script can be used in the following three scenarios:

  - **Migrating configuration settings to a new version of Lync Server:** Contoso is in the process of migrating to Lync Server 2013 and as part of the migration process the Lync Server administrator would like to move the unassigned numbers configuration serviced by the announcement application from the Lync Server 2010 deployment to the new Lync Server 2013 deployment. To move the configuration settings, the Lync Server administrator uses the Unassigned Number Announcements Migration tool.

  - **Rolling back a deployment from Lync Server 2013 to Lync Server 2010:** Due unexpected factors, Contoso has to roll back the migration to the new Lync Server 2013 deployment. To minimize disruptions to the service, the Lync Server administrator uses the Unassigned Number Announcements Migration tool to roll back the configuration from the Lync Server 2013 deployment to the Lync Server 2010 deployment.

  - **Moving data between Lync deployments:** Contoso is in the process of replacing all the servers of one pool with newer servers. Their strategy is to deploy a new Lync Server 2013 pool, move all the data from the old to the new pool, and then deprecate the old pool. Once the new pool is deployed, the Unassigned Number Announcements Migration tool is used to move the configuration from the old pool to the new one.

<div>

## Requirements

The following are the main requirements needed to successfully run the tool:

1.  The script must be run from a computer that has Lync Server 2013 Management Shell installed.

2.  The announcement application has to be successfully deployed in the source and destination Lync Servers or Pools.

<div>

## Move-CsAnnouncementConfiguration script

The Move-CsAnnouncementConfiguration script requires the two parameters that are described in the table below.

![Move-CsAnnouncementConfiguration parameters.](images/JJ945604.7ab66ad3-d0db-4d77-8b93-ebccf0cb0663(OCS.15).jpg "Move-CsAnnouncementConfiguration parameters.")

## Web Conf Data

The Web Conf Data Tool allows an administrator of Lync Server 2013 communications software to have more control over the data associated with an organizer’s Web conferences. Scenarios include the ability to delete a specific user’s meeting data based on a time stamp criteria.

<div>

## Description

This tool allows the administrator to perform the following operations:

1.  Find all Web conferencing data associated with a single user.

2.  Delete all Web conferencing data associated with a single user.

3.  Delete all Web conferencing data associated with a single user that is older than a certain date.

4.  Move all Web conferencing data associated with a single user when that user is moved from one pool to another.

<div>


> [!NOTE]  
> The Resource Kit Tools for Lync Server 2010 supported moving all Web conferencing data associated with a single user when that user is moved from one pool to another. That functionality is now deprecated from this tool in favor of the <STRONG>MoveConferenceData</STRONG> parameter. For details about this parameter, see the <A href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg398528(v=ocs.15)">Move-CsUser</A> cmdlet.



</div>

The tool deletes meeting data only for meetings that are inactive. Active meetings (or meetings in sessions) cannot be deleted.

This tool must be run from a computer that is in the same pool as the target user. The user whose meeting content data is being managed by this tool must be homed in the same user pool.

</div>

<div>

## Output

This tool outputs the results of each of the operations:

  - If a query is performed, the tool outputs the list of all inactive meeting data folders that have that user as an organizer.

  - If a delete is performed, the tool outputs the list of all meeting data folders whose data will be deleted.

</div>

<div>

## Requirements

The tool needs to be run in the same pool where the organizer is currently homed.

The tool must be run using administrator privileges with access to the Content File Store.

</div>

<div>

## Examples

The following table describes the parameters, some of which are used in the examples.

![Web Conf Data Tool parameters.](images/JJ945604.a733c1c6-5dfc-4874-a74f-bfdee81c1401(OCS.15).jpg "Web Conf Data Tool parameters.")

    WebConfDataTool.exe /User:user0@contoso.com /Action:query ""/ExpirationDate:08/09/2010 12:00:00""

The preceding example shows how a query command would work. The output of such a command would be a list of all meeting content folders that would be affected by this tool.

    WebConfDataTool.exe /User:user0@contoso.com /Action:delete

The preceding is an example of a delete command. The delete command will remove all inactive meeting folders from this user.

</div>

<div>

## Summary

This tool can be a valuable resource to administrators who need more precise control over conference meeting data.
