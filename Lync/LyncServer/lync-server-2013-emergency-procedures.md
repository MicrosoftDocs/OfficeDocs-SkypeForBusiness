Emergency procedures are on-demand procedures that fall outside the standard procedures previously discussed and should be handled by the change management function (refer to the [MOF](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=40939) for a description on the "change management" function). These procedures usually relate to one of the following:

  - Implementing change as part of a troubleshooting effort—to resolve an identified system issue.

  - Resolve an identified security threat—such as software updates.

Impact to the business should be evaluated to determine whether a temporary change should be implemented or channeled through the official change management procedures as defined by the Changing Quadrant guidance.

We recommend implementing emergency change procedures. For example, document how to deal with these types of procedures and help with reducing a state of confusion when an emergency change is presented.
