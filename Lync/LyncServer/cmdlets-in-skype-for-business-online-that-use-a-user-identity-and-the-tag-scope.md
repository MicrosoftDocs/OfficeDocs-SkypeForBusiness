# Cmdlets in Skype for Business Online that use a user identity and the tag scope

 


The **Grant-Cs** cmdlets (used for assigning policies to users) require two identifiers: a user identity (the Identity parameter) and the identity of a per-user policy (the PolicyName parameter). For example, to assign the voice policy, RedmondVoicePolicy, to the user Ken Myer, you use the following command:

    Grant-CsVoicePolicy -Identity "Ken Myer" -PolicyName "RedmondVoicePolicy"

There are two things to keep in mind when assigning policies to users. First, only per-user policies can be assigned. You cannot assign the global policy to a user. For example, this command will fail:

    Grant-CsVoicePolicy -Identity "Ken Myer" -PolicyName "global"

This command fails because there is no need to assign the global policy. If you want to manage a user by using the global policy, just be sure that you do not assign that user a per-user policy. If no per-user policy has been assigned to a user, the user will automatically be managed by using the global policy.


> [!NOTE]  
> What if the user has previously been assigned a per-user policy, and you want to unassign that policy and have the user managed by the global policy instead? In that case, you’ll first use the following syntax, which unassigns a per-user policy by granting that user a null policy:<BR>Grant-CsVoicePolicy –Identity "Ken Myer" –PolicyName $Null



Second, keep in mind that per-user policies are created at the tag scope. However, you can omit the tag **prefix** when specifying a policy name. These two commands are identical:

    Grant-CsVoicePolicy -Identity "Ken Myer" -PolicyName "tag:RedmondVoicePolicy"
    Grant-CsVoicePolicy -Identity "Ken Myer" -PolicyName "RedmondVoicePolicy"

If you would like to return the identities for all your per-user policies (or, at least, all the per-user policies of specified type, such as voice policies), use a command similar to this:

    Get-CsVoicePolicy -Filter "tag:*"

The following cmdlets make use of both a user Identity and the tag scope:
