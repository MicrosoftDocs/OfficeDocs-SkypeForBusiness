## Description

The Test-CsDialPlan cmdlet enables you to see the results of applying a dial plan to a given telephone number. Dial plans provide information, such as how normalization rules are applied, required to enable Enterprise Voice users to make telephone calls. Given a dialed number and a dial plan, this cmdlet will verify which normalization rule within the dial plan will be applied and what the translated number will be.

You can use this cmdlet for troubleshooting issues with number translations, or for verifying how to apply rules against certain numbers.

## Running the test

The Test-CsDialPlan cmdlet requires you to do two things. First, you must obtain an instance of the dial plan being tested; that can be done by using the Get-CsDialPlan cmdlet. Second, you must specify the phone number that has to be normalized. The format that is used for the phone number should match the number as dialed/entered by a user. For example, this command retrieves an instance of the dial plan, RedmondDialPlan, and checks whether the phone number 12065551219 can be normalized:

    Get-CsDialPlan -Identity "RedmondDialPlan" | Test-CsDialPlan -DialedNumber "12065551219" | Format-List

If you have a normalization rule that automatically adds the country code (in this example, 1) and the area code (206), then you might want to check the phone number 5551219, as follows:

    Get-CsDialPlan -Identity "RedmondDialPlan" | Test-CsDialPlan -DialedNumber "5551219" | Format-List

For more information, see the Help documentation for the [Test-CsDialPlan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/skype/Test-CsDialPlan) cmdlet.

## Determining success or failure

Test-CsDialPlan differs from many of the Lync Server test cmdlets because it only indirectly indicates whether a test succeeded or failed. When using Test-CsDialPlan you do not receive back output similar to this with the Result clearly labeled:

TargetFqdn : atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com

Result : Success

Latency : 00:00:06.8630376

Error :

Diagnosis :

Instead, if Test-CsDialPlan succeeds, then you'll receive information about the normalization rule that was able to successfully translate and use the specified phone number:

TranslatedNumber : +12065551219

MatchingRule : Description=;Pattern=^(\\d(11))$;Translation=+$1;

Name=Prefix All; IsInternalExtension=False

If Test-CsDialPlan fails (that is, if the dial plan does not have a normalization rule that can translate the specified phone number), you'll just receive “empty” output as follows:

TranslatedNumber :

MatchingRule :

</div>

## Reasons why the test might have failed

Here are some common reasons why Test-CsDialPlan might fail:

  - You might have used an incorrect format when specifying the phone number. Dial plans include normalization rules that enable Lync Server to translate the phone numbers dialed or entered by a user. Therefore, your dial plan should have normalization rules that match the numbers users are likely to dial. For example, if users might dial the country code, area code, and then the phone number itself, that means that your dial plan should have a normalization rule to handle phone numbers such as this:
    
    12065551219
    
    However, if you enter an incorrect phone number (for example, leaving off the final digit), then Test-CsDialPlan will fail. That’s not because the dial plan is faulty but because you have entered a phone number than can’t be interpreted.
