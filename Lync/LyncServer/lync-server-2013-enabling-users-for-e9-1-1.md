During client registration, Lync Server uses a location policy to configure the E9-1-1 properties for Enterprise Voice-enabled users. This policy contains the settings that define how E9-1-1 is implemented. For example, the location policy contains information such as the emergency dial string, and whether or not a user is required to manually enter a location if the Location Information service does not automatically provide one. For a complete definition of a location policy, see [Defining the location policy for Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-defining-the-location-policy.md).

Lync Server can assign a location policy to clients based on subnet, or to users based on a global, per-site, or per-user policy. To help decide how you will enable users, you should first answer the following questions.

  - **Do you plan to enable all users, or limit support to specific geographic areas of the enterprise?**  
    You can assign a location to all users in your enterprise by using a global location policy. However, by assigning a location policy to a Lync Server network site and then adding subnets to the site, you can limit E9-1-1 support to selected locations within the enterprise and specify E9-1-1 routing behavior on a per-site basis.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Do you plan to enable individual users through a user policy?**  
    You can assign location policies directly to specific users or common area phone contact objects if you want to customize their E9-1-1 support.

<!-- end list -->

  - **When clients roam outside the network or connect from an undefined subnet, should the clients still be enabled for E9-1-1?**  
    If users are assigned a global, site, or per-user location policy, they can be required to manually enter a location into the client if the client is not located within a defined subnet or no location has been found by the Location Information service. For details, see [Defining the user experience for manually acquiring a location in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-defining-the-user-experience-for-manually-acquiring-a-location.md).
