You might want to delete the contact object associated with a common area phone. For example, if you remove the phone from an employee lounge, there’s no need to have a contact object associated with that phone. The **Remove-CsCommonAreaPhone** cmdlet provides a way for you to delete common area phone accounts. When you run this cmdlet, the phone is deleted from the list of common area phones returned by **Get-CsCommonAreaPhone**. In addition, the contact object associated with that phone is deleted from Active Directory Domain Services.

Use **Remove-CsCommonAreaPhone** to remove one common area phone or all common area phones that have a common element, such as a display name or country and area code. You can run this cmdlet from either the Lync Server 2013 Management Shell or from a remote session of Windows PowerShell. For details about using remote Windows PowerShell to connect to Lync Server, see the Lync Server Windows PowerShell blog article "Quick Start: Managing Microsoft Lync Server 2010 Using Remote PowerShell" at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=255876](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=255876).
