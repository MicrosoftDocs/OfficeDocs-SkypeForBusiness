The Centralized Logging Service is configured to define what the logging service is intended to collect, how it collects, where it will collect from, and what the log settings are. You define these settings globally (that is, for the entire deployment) or for a site (that is, a named site in your deployment). Any logging that you define will use the settings that are appropriate for the identity that you use for commands to start, stop, flush, and search logs.

<div>

## To display the current Centralized Logging Service configuration

1.  Start the Lync Server Management Shell: Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft Lync Server 2013**, and then click **Lync Server Management Shell**.

2.  Type the following at a command-line prompt:
    
        Get-CsClsConfiguration
    
    <div>
    

    > [!TIP]
    > You can narrow or expand the scope of the configuration settings that are returned by defining <CODE>-Identity</CODE> and a scope, such as "Site:Redmond" to return only the CsClsConfiguration for the site Redmond. If you want details about a given portion of the configuration, you can pipe the output into another Windows PowerShell cmdlet. For example, to get details about the scenarios defined in the configuration for site "Redmond", type: <CODE>Get-CsClsConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond" | Select-Object -ExpandPropery Scenarios</CODE>

    The result from the cmdlet displays the current configuration of the Centralized Logging Service.
