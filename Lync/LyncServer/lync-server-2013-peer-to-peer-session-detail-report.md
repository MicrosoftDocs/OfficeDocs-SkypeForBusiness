_**Topic Last Modified:** 2012-06-06_

The Peer-to-Peer Session Detail Report returns detailed information about a peer-to-peer session. For example, if you select an instant messaging session, the report will tell you the number of messages sent by each of the two users in the session.

<div>

## Accessing the Peer-to-Peer Session Detail Report

The Peer-to-Peer Session Detail Report can be accessed from any of the following reports (all of which can be accessed from the Monitoring Reports home page):

  - IP Phone Inventory Report

  - User Activity Report

  - Call Admission Control Report

  - Failure List Report

From within the Peer-to-Peer Session Detail Report you can access the [Diagnostic Report in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-diagnostic-report.md) by clicking the Diagnostic Report (Details) metric. You can also access the Top Failures Report by clicking either of these two metrics:

  - Response

  - Diagnostic ID

## Making the Best Use of the Peer-to-Peer session Detail Report

The Peer-to-Peer Session Detail Report includes a large number of metrics, many of which might not be familiar to system administrators. Often-times, however, you can view a tooltip that offers a brief description of that metric simply by holding your mouse over the metric label.

Note that the actual metrics shown on a given report will depend on the type of peer-to-peer session you selected. An audio/video session will report a different set of metrics than an instant messaging session.

You can also hold your mouse over the Response code and Diagnostic ID metrics in order to obtain a description of those values:
