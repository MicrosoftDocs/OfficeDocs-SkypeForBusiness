## Description

The Mobility Service enables mobile device users to do such things as:

1.  Exchange instant messages and presence information.

2.  Store and retrieve voice mail internally instead of with their wireless provider.

3.  Take advantage of Lync Server capabilities such as Call via Work and dial-out conferencing.

The Test-CsMxcP2PIM cmdlet provides a quick and easy way to verify that users can use the Mobility Service to exchange instant messages.

## Running the test

To run this test, you must create two Windows PowerShell credentials objects (objects that contain the account name and password) for each account. You must then include those credentials objects and the SIP addresses of the two accounts when you call Test-CsMcxP2PIM:

    $credential1 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\kenmyer"
    $credential2 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\pilar"
    
    Test-CsMcxP2PIM -TargetFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -Authentication Negotiate -SenderSipAddres "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -SenderCredential $credential1 -ReceiverSipAddress "sip:packerman@litwareinc.com" -ReceiverCredential $credential2

For more information, see the help topic for the [Test-CsMcxP2PIM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/skype/Test-CsMcxP2PIM) cmdlet.

## Determining success or failure

If the two test users can exchange instant messages by using the mobility service then Test-CsMcxP2PIM will return test result Success:

Target Fqdn : atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com

Target Uri : http://atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com:443/mcx

Result : Success

Latency : 00:00:00

Error Message :

Diagnosis :

If the test fails then the Result will be set to Failure and a detailed error message and diagnosis will be displayed:

Target Fqdn : atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com

Target Uri : https://atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com:443/mcx

Result : Failure

Latency : 00:00:00

Error Message : No response received for Web-Ticket service.

Inner Exception:The HHTP request is unauthorized with

client negotiation scheme 'Ntlm'. The authentication

header received from the server was 'Negotiate,NTLM'.

Inner Exception:The remote server returned an error:

(401) Unauthorized.

## Reasons why the test might have failed

If Test-CsMcxP2PIM fails your first step should be to verify that the mobility service is up and running. That can be done by using a web browser to verify that the mobility service URL for your Lync Server pool can be accessed. For example, this command verifies the URL for the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com:

    https://atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com/mcx/mcxservice.svc

If the mobility service seems to be running then verify that your two test users have valid Lync Server accounts. You can retrieve account information by using a command similar to this:

    Get-CsUser -Identity "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" | Select-Object Enabled

If the Enabled property is not equal to True or if the command fails, that means that the user does not have a valid Lync Server account.

You should also verify that the user is enabled for mobility. To do that, first determine the mobility policy that is assigned to the account:

    Get-CsUser -Identity "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" | Select-Object MobilityPolicy

After you know the policy name, use the Get-CsMobilityPolicy cmdlet to verify that the policy in question (for example, RedmondMobilityPolicy) has the EnableMobility property set to True:

    Get-CsMobilityPolicy -Identity "RedmondMobilityPolicy"

If you receive an error message with authentication headers, that often means that you have not specified a valid user account. Verify the user name and password and then try the test again. If you are convinced that the user account is valid, then use the Get-CsWebServiceConfiguration cmdlet and check the value of the UseWindowsAuth property. That will tell you which authentication methods are enabled in your organization.For more tips about how to troubleshoot the mobility service, see the blog post [Troubleshooting External Lync Mobility Connectivity Issues Step-by-Step](http://blogs.technet.com/b/nexthop/archive/2012/02/21/troubleshooting-external-lync-mobility-connectivity-issues-step-by-step.aspx).
