There are generally two methods for enrolling users for smart card authentication. The easier method involves having users enroll directly for smart card authentication using web enrollment, while the more complex method involves using an enrollment agent. This topic focuses on self-enrollment for smartcard certificates.

For more information on enrolling on behalf of users as an enrollment agent, see Enroll for Certificates on Behalf of Other Users at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=313367](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=313367).
