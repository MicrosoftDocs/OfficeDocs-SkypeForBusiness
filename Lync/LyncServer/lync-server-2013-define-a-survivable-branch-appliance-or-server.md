Perform this procedure at the central site if you did not define the Survivable Branch Appliance or Server when you added it to your topology.

<div>

## To define a Survivable Branch Appliance or Survivable Branch Server

1.  Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft Lync Server 2013**, and then click **Lync Server Topology Builder**.

2.  In the console tree, expand the central site, expand **Branch sites**, and then expand the name of the branch site where you plan to deploy the Survivable Branch Appliance or Survivable Branch Server.

3.  Right-click **Survivable Branch Appliances**, and then click **New Survivable Branch Appliance**.
    
    <div>
    

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > <STRONG>Survivable Branch Appliances</STRONG> is where you define Survivable Branch Servers and Survivable Branch Appliances.

    
    </div>

4.  In the **Define Survivable Branch Appliance** dialog box, click **FQDN**, type the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the Survivable Branch Appliance or Survivable Branch Server you will deploy at this branch site, and then click **Next**.
    
    <div>
    

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > If you are defining a Survivable Branch Appliance, the name you enter in <STRONG>FQDN</STRONG> must be the same as the Survivable Branch Appliance FQDN you assigned to the <STRONG>servicePrincipalName</STRONG> attribute. For details, see <A href="lync-server-2013-add-a-survivable-branch-appliance-to-active-directory.md">Add a Survivable Branch Appliance to Active Directory in Lync Server 2013</A>.

    
    </div>

5.  Click **Front End pool**, click the Front End Server (User Services pool) at the central site that this Survivable Branch Appliance or Survivable Branch Server will connect to, and then click **Next**.

6.  Click **Edge Server**, click the Edge pool that this Survivable Branch Appliance or Survivable Branch Server will connect to provide PSTN connectivity to remote users of the branch site, and then click **Next**.

7.  Click **Gateway FQDN or IP Address**, and then type the FQDN or IP address of the gateway peer that the Survivable Branch Appliance or Survivable Branch Server is associated with for routing inbound or outbound PSTN calls.
    
    <div>
    

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > If you are defining a Survivable Branch Appliance, this is the gateway to which the Mediation Server inside the Survivable Branch Appliance will connect for PSTN connectivity.

    
    </div>

8.  Click **Listening Port for IP/PSTN Gateway**, and then accept the default port.

9.  In **Sip Transport Protocol**, click the transport protocol the Survivable Branch Appliance or Survivable Branch Server will use, and then click **Finish**.
    
    <div>
    

    > [!NOTE]  
    > For security reasons, we strongly recommend that you use Transport Layer Security (TLS). If you are defining a Survivable Branch Appliance, refer to your Survivable Branch Appliance vendor documentation to verify that your Survivable Branch Appliance supports the TLS protocol.

    
    </div>

10. In the console tree, right-click the new Survivable Branch Appliance or Server, click **Topology**, and then click **Publish**.
