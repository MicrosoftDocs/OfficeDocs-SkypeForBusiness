When you create workflows, there are two possible scenarios:

  - **The Administrator creates and configures the workflow** — The CsResponseGroupAdministrator role member (or equivalent) creates and activates the workflow and all elements in the workflow, such as the agent groups, queues, holiday and business hours, music on hold, and so on.

  - **The Administrator creates the workflow and the Manager configures options** — The CsResponseGroupAdministrator role member (or equivalent) defines the primary SIP URI, Display Name, assigns a member or members of the CsResponseGroupManager role, and selects a queue and activates the workflow. The CsResponseGroupManager can then log on and edit the configuration of the workflow by creating agent groups and also assigns the group to the queue, configuring the telephone number, holiday and business hours, music on hold, and so on.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > When you want to create a managed workflow, you need to create the workflow as active. After you save an active, managed workflow, you can then modify and deactivate the workflow.
