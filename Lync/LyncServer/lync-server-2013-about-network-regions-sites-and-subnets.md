The advanced Enterprise Voice features described in this section share certain configuration requirements for network regions, network sites, and subnets. For example, all three advanced features require that each subnet in your topology be associated with a specific *network site*, and each network site must be associated with a *network region*.

<div>


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before you begin network configuration for call admission control, E9-1-1, or media bypass, make sure that you reviewed additional information about network settings in the <A href="lync-server-2013-network-settings-for-the-advanced-enterprise-voice-features.md">Network settings for the advanced Enterprise Voice features in Lync Server 2013</A> topic in the Planning documentation. For details about network configuration primarily about call admission control, also see <A href="lync-server-2013-defining-your-requirements-for-call-admission-control.md">Defining your requirements for call admission control in Lync Server 2013</A> in the Planning documentation.



</div>

Call admission control and E9-1-1 have additional configuration requirements for network sites:

  - Call admission control requires that a *bandwidth policy profile* be specified for each site that is constrained by WAN bandwidth limitations. If you plan to deploy call admission control, you must [Create bandwidth policy profiles in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-create-bandwidth-policy-profiles.md) before you configure your network sites.

  - E9-1-1 requires that a *location policy* be specified for each site. If you plan to deploy E9-1-1, you must [Create location policies in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-create-location-policies.md) before you configure your network sites.

## Create or Modify Network Regions, Network Sites, and Subnets

The following topics provide steps to create or modify network regions and network sites, and to associate subnets with network sites. These topics are not specific to any particular advanced Enterprise Voice feature.
