The Announcement application is an Enterprise Voice feature that enables you to configure what happens to calls to unassigned extensions (extensions that are valid for your organization, but are not assigned to a person or a phone). For example, you can configure calls to unassigned numbers to play a message, or to be transferred to a different destination, or both.

The Announcement application is installed as a feature of Response Group application on the Front End Server or Standard Edition server when you deploy Enterprise Voice. You need to configure Announcements by uploading your audio files or by configuring text-to-speech (TTS) and configuring the unassigned number table.

This section guides you through the configuration of Lync Server Announcements. It assumes that you have already read the planning sections related to Announcements and deployed an Enterprise Edition server or a Standard Edition server with Enterprise Voice.
