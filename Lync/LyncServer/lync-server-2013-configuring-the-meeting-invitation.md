You can customize meeting invitations sent by the Online Meeting Add-in for Lync 2013 by including the following optional items in the body of the meeting invitation:

  - **Your organization’s logo** Add your organization’s logo to meeting invitations by using the Logo URL option. If meeting invitations will be sent to people external to your organization, the image should be located at a publicly available URL. The supported image formats are GIF and JPG. Although Lync Server 2013 stores the URL with no size restrictions on the image, for best results, the maximum size of the image should be 30 pixels high by 188 pixels wide.

  - **A Custom Help or Support Link** Add a URL for your organization’s help or support team website. If meeting invitations will be sent to people external to your organization, the URL should be publicly available. The maximum URL length is 1 KB.

  - **Legal disclaimer text** Add a URL for legal text or a disclaimer that will be displayed in all meeting invitations. If meeting invitations will be sent to people external to your organization, the URL should be publicly available. The maximum URL length is 1 KB.

  - **Custom footer text** Add text that will be rendered as a custom footer in the invitation. The maximum length of text that can be added is 2 KB.

You can configure these options by using either Lync Server Control Panel or Lync Server Management Shell.
