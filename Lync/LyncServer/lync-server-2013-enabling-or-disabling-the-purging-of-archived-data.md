In Lync Server 2013 Control Panel, you use Archiving configurations to enable and disable purging and configure how purging is implemented. This includes the following Archiving configurations:

  - A global configuration that is created by default when you deploy Lync Server 2013.

  - Optional site-level and pool-level configurations that you can create and use to specify how archiving is implemented for specific sites or pools.

You initially set up Archiving configurations when you deploy Archiving, but you can change, add, and delete configurations after deployment. For details about how Archiving configurations are implemented, including which options you can specify and the hierarchy of Archiving configurations, see [How Archiving works in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-how-archiving-works.md) in the Planning documentation, Deployment documentation, or Operations documentation.

<div>


> [!NOTE]  
> To use archiving for users who are homed on Lync Server 2013 you must configure Archiving policies to specify whether to enable archiving for internal communications, for external communications, or for both. By default, archiving is not enabled for either internal or external communications. Prior to enabling Archiving in any policies, you should specify the appropriate Archiving configurations for your deployment and, optionally, for specific sites and pools, as described in this section. For details about enabling Archiving, see <A href="lync-server-2013-configuring-and-assigning-archiving-policies.md">Configuring and assigning Archiving policies in Lync Server 2013</A> in the Deployment documentation.<BR>If you decide after you deploy Archiving that you want to use Microsoft Exchange integration to store archiving data and files on Exchange 2013 servers and all your users are homed on your Exchange 2013 servers, you should remove the SQL Server database configuration from your topology. You must use Topology Builder to do this. For details, see <A href="lync-server-2013-changing-archiving-database-options.md">Changing Archiving database options in Lync Server 2013</A> in the Operations documentation.

## To enable or disable purging for archiving

1.  From a user account that is assigned to the CsArchivingAdministrator or CsAdministrator role, log on to any computer in your internal deployment.

2.  Open a browser window, and then enter the Admin URL to open the Lync Server Control Panel. For details about the different methods you can use to start Lync Server Control Panel, see [Open Lync Server 2013 administrative tools](lync-server-2013-open-lync-server-administrative-tools.md).

3.  In the left navigation bar, click **Monitoring and Archiving**, and then click **Archiving Configuration**.

4.  Click the name of the appropriate global, site, or pool configuration in the list of archiving configurations, click **Edit**, click **Show details**, and then do the following:
    
      - To enable purging, select the **Enable purging of archiving data** check box and then do one of the following:
        
          - To purge all records, click the **Purge exported archiving data and stored archiving data after maximum duration (days)**, and then specify the number of days.
        
          - To purge only the data that has been exported, click **Purge exported archiving data only**.
    
      - To disable purging, clear the **Enable purging of archiving data** check box.

5.  Click **Commit**.

## Enabling or Disabling the Purging of Archiving Data by Using Windows PowerShell Cmdlets

Enabling and disabling the automated purging of archiving data can be managed by using Windows PowerShell and the **Set-CsArchivingConfiguration** cmdlet. This cmdlet can be run either from the Lync Server 2013 Management Shell or from a remote session of Windows PowerShell. For details about using remote Windows PowerShell to connect to Lync Server, see the Lync Server Windows PowerShell blog article "Quick Start: Managing Microsoft Lync Server 2010 Using Remote PowerShell" at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=255876](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=255876).

<div>

## To enable the purging of all archiving data

  - To enable the purging of all archiving data set the **EnablePurging** property to true ($True). For example:
    
        Set-CsArchivingConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond" -EnablePurging $True
    
    After this command is run, then every day Lync Server will purge all archiving records older than the value specified for the **KeepArchivingDataForDays** property.

</div>

<div>

## To enable the purging only of exported archiving data

  - To limit purging to archiving records that have been exported to a data file (by using the [Export-CsArchivingData](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/skype/Export-CsArchivingData) cmdlet) you must also set the PurgeExportedArchivesOnly property to True ($True). For example:
    
        Set-CsArchivingConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond" -EnablePurging $True -PurgeExportedArchivesOnly $True
    
    After this command is run, Lync Server will only purge archiving records that meet two criteria: 1) they are older than the value specified for the **KeepArchivingDataForDays** property; and, 2) they have been exported by using the **Export-CsArchivingData** cmdlet.

</div>

<div>

## To disable the purging of all archiving data

  - To disable the automated purging of archiving records, set the **EnablePurging** property to False ($False). For example:
    
        Set-CsArchivingConfiguration -Identity "site:Redmond" -EnablePurging $False

</div>

For more information, including additional options for purging archiving data, see the help topic for the [Set-CsArchivingConfiguration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/skype/Set-CsArchivingConfiguration) cmdlet.
