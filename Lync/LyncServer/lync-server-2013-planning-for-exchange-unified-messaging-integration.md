Lync Server 2013 supports integration with Exchange Unified Messaging (UM) for combining voice messaging and email messaging into a single messaging infrastructure. In Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 Service Pack 1 (SP1) and Microsoft Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Unified Messaging (UM) is one of several Exchange server roles that you can install and configure.

In Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, Exchange UM runs as a service on an Exchange Mailbox server. For Lync Server 2013 Enterprise Voice deployments, Unified Messaging combines voice messaging and email messaging into a single store that is available from a telephone (Outlook Voice Access) or a computer. Unified Messaging and Lync Server 2013 work together to provide call answering, Outlook Voice Access, and auto-attendant services to users of Enterprise Voice.

For more information about the architecture changes in Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, see “Voice Architecture Changes” in the Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 documentation at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=266730](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=266730).

For these features to be supported in an on-premises Exchange UM deployment, you must be running one of the following:

  - Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 Service Pack 1 (SP1) or latest service pack

  - Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 or latest service pack

  - Microsoft Exchange Server 2013
