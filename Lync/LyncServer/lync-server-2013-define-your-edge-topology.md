_**Topic Last Modified:** 2012-09-28_

You must use Topology Builder to build your topology and you must set up at least one internal Front End pool or Standard Edition server before you can deploy your Edge Server. Use the following procedure to define the edge topology for a single Edge Server, and then use the procedures in [Publish your topology in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-publish-your-topology.md) and [Export your Lync Server 2013 topology and copy it to external media for edge installation](lync-server-2013-export-your-topology-and-copy-it-to-external-media-for-edge-installation.md) to publish the topology and make it available to your Edge Server.

<div>


> [!NOTE]  
> The internal Edge interface and external Edge interface must use the same type of load balancing. You cannot use DNS load balancing on one Edge interface and hardware load balancing on the other Edge interface.



</div>

To successfully publish, enable, or disable a topology when adding or removing a server role, you must be logged in as a user who is a member of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins and Domain Admins groups. You can also grant the administrator rights and permissions required for adding server roles to a user account. For details, see [Delegate setup permissions in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-delegate-setup-permissions.md) in the Standard Edition server or Enterprise Edition server Deployment documentation. For other configuration changes, only membership in the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group is required.

If you defined your edge topology when you defined and published your internal topology, and no changes are required to the edge topology that you previously defined, you do not need to do define it and publish it again. Use the following procedure only if you need to make changes to your edge topology. You must make the previously defined and published topology available to your Edge Servers, which you do by using the procedure in [Export your Lync Server 2013 topology and copy it to external media for edge installation](lync-server-2013-export-your-topology-and-copy-it-to-external-media-for-edge-installation.md).

<div>


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You cannot run Topology Builder from an Edge Server. You must run it from your Front End Server or Standard Edition servers.



</div>

The process to define your Edge Server topology is done in Topology Builder. The three primary types of Edge Server topologies that you plan and configure are listed below:

  - To define the Topology for a Single Edge Server

  - To define the Topology for a Load Balanced Edge Server Pool

  - To define the Topology for a Hardware Load Balanced Edge Pool

<div>

## To define the topology for a single Edge Server

1.  Start Topology Builder: Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft Lync Server 2013**, and then click **Lync Server Topology Builder**.

2.  In the console tree, expand the site in which you want to deploy an Edge Server.

3.  Right-click **Edge pools**, and then click **New Edge Pool**.

4.  In **Define the New Edge Pool**, click **Next**.

5.  In **Define the Edge pool FQDN**, do the following:
    
      - In **Pool FQDN**, type the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the internal interface for the Edge Server.
        
        <div>
        

        > [!IMPORTANT]  
        > The name you specify must be identical to the computer name configured on the server. By default the computer name of a computer that is not joined to a domain is a short name, not an FQDN. Topology Builder uses FQDNs, not short names. So, you must configure a DNS suffix on the name of the computer to be deployed as an Edge Server that is not joined to a domain. Use only standard characters (including A–Z, a–z, 0–9, and hyphens) when assigning FQDNs of your Lync Servers, Edge Servers, and pools. Do not use Unicode characters or underscores. Nonstandard characters in an FQDN are often not supported by external DNS and public CAs (when the FQDN must be assigned to the SN in the certificate). For details about adding a DNS suffix to a computer name, see <A href="lync-server-2013-configure-dns-for-edge-support.md">Configure DNS for edge support in Lync Server 2013</A>.

        
        </div>
    
      - Click **Single computer pool**, and then click **Next**.

6.  In **Select features**, do the following:
    
      - If you plan to use a single FQDN and IP address for the SIP Access service, Lync Server 2013 Web Conferencing service, and A/V Edge services, select the **Use a single FQDN and IP Address** check box.
    
      - If you plan to enable federation select the **Enable federation for this Edge pool (Port 5061)** check box.
        
        <div>
        

        > [!NOTE]  
        > You can select this option, but only one Edge pool or Edge Server in your organization can be published externally for federation. All access by federated users, including public instant messaging (IM) users, go through the same Edge pool or single Edge Server. For example, if your deployment includes an Edge pool or single Edge Server deployed in New York and one deployed in London and you enable federation support on the New York Edge pool or single Edge Server, signal traffic for federated users will go through the New York Edge pool or single Edge Server. This is true even for communications with London users, although a London internal user calling a London federated user uses the London pool or Edge Server for A/V traffic.

        
        </div>
    
      - If you plan to support the extensible messaging and presence protocol (XMPP) for your deployment, select the **Enable XMPP federation (port 5269)** check box

7.  In **Select IP Options**, do the following:
    
      - **Enable IPv4 on internal interface**: Select the check box if you want to apply an IPv4 address to the Edge Server or Edge pool internal interface
    
      - **Enable IPv6 on internal interface**: Select the check box if you want to apply an IPv6 address to the Edge Server or Edge pool internal interface
    
      - **Enable IPv4 on external interface**: Select the check box if you want to apply an IPv4 address to the Edge Server or Edge pool external interface
    
      - **Enable IPv6 on external interface**: Select the check box if you want to apply an IPv6 address to the Edge Server or Edge pool external interface
    
    You can also configure the Edge Server or Edge pool to use a network address translation address for the external IP addresses. You do this by selecting the check box **The external IP address of this Edge pool is translated by NAT**.

8.  In **External FQDNs**, do the following:
    
      - If in **Select features** you chose to use a single FQDN and IP address for the SIP access, Web Conferencing service, and A/V Edge service, type the external FQDN in **SIP Access**.
        
        <div>
        

        > [!NOTE]  
        > If you choose this option, you must specify a different port number for each of the edge services (recommended port settings: 5061 for Access Edge service, 444 for Web Conferencing Edge service, and 443 for A/V Edge service). Selecting this option can help prevent potential connectivity issues, and simplify the configuration because you can then use the same port number (for example, 443) for all three services.

        
        </div>
    
      - If in **Select features** you did not chose to use a single FQDN and IP Address, type the External FQDNs for **SIP Access**, **Web Conferencing** and **Audio Video**, keeping the default ports.

9.  Click **Next**.

10. In **Define the Internal IP address**, type the IP address of your Edge Server in **Internal IPv4 address** and **Internal IPv6 address** as is appropriate for your requirements. Click **Next**.

11. In **Define the External IP address**, do the following:
    
      - If you chose to use a single FQDN and IP Address for the SIP access, Web Conferencing service, and A/V Edge service, type the external IPv4 address of the Edge Server in **SIP Access**, and then, click **Next**.
    
      - If you chose to use IPv6 addresses, type the external IPv6 address of the Edge Server in **SIP Access**, and then, click **Next**.
    
      - If you did not chose to use a single FQDN and IP Address for the SIP access, Web Conferencing service, and A/V Edge service, type the external IPv4 addresses of the Edge Server in **SIP Access**, **Web Conferencing**, and **A/V Conferencing**, and then click **Next**.
    
      - If you chose to use IPv6 addresses and did not chose to use a single FQDN and IP Address for the SIP access, Web Conferencing service, and A/V Edge service, type the external IPv6 addresses of the Edge Server in **SIP Access**, **Web Conferencing**, and **A/V Conferencing**, and then click **Next**.
        
        <div>
        

        > [!NOTE]  
        > If you did not choose to enable and assign IPv6 addressing, you will not see this dialog box.

        
        </div>

12. If you chose to use NAT, a dialog box appears. In **Public IPv4 address for the A/V Edge service**, type the public IPv4 address to be translated by NAT, and then click **Next**.
    
    <div>
    

    > [!NOTE]  
    > This should be the external IP address of the A/V Edge service.

    
    </div>

13. If you chose to use NAT and IPv6 addresses, a dialog box appears. In **Public IPv6 address for the A/V Edge service**, type the public IPv6 address to be translated by NAT, and then click **Next**.
    
    <div>
    

    > [!NOTE]  
    > This should be the external IP address of the A/V Edge service.

    
    </div>

14. In **Define the next hop**, in **Next hop pool**, select the name of the internal pool, which can be either a Front End pool or a Standard Edition pool. Or, if your deployment includes a Director, select the Director. Then, click **Next**.

15. In **Associate Front End pools**, specify one or more internal pools, which can include Front End pools and Standard Edition servers, to be associated with this Edge Server, by selecting the names of the internal pools that are to use this Edge Server for communication with supported external users.
    
    <div>
    

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Only one load-balanced Edge pool or single Edge Server can be associated with each internal pool for A/V traffic. If you already have an internal pool associated with an Edge pool or Edge Server, a warning appears indicating that the internal pool is already associated an Edge pool or Edge Server. If you select a pool that is already associated with another Edge Server, it will change the association.

    
    </div>

16. Click **Finish**.

17. Publish your topology.
