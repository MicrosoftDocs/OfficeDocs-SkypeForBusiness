_**Topic Last Modified:** 2012-10-01_

Microsoft SQL Server 2012 has specific requirements when installing and deploying Lync Server 2013. Because Windows and SQL Server define their security differently, logging in as an administrator in the Active Directory domain does not implicitly grant permissions for SQL Server. You must also be a member of the sysadmin entity on the SQL Server-based server you are configuring.

## Permissions Required for Database and Lync Server Installation

The following options detail three permissions and group membership associations for installation of Lync Server 2013 files and SQL Server databases. Choose the scenario that best meets the requirements of your organization.

<td><p>Lync Server 2013 administrator is member of RTCUniversalServerAdmins</p></td>
<td><p>The Lync Server 2013 administrator can install Lync Server 2013, but cannot install the databases. The SQL Server administrator uses the Lync Server Management Shell and Windows PowerShell cmdlets provided by the Lync Server 2013 administrator to install the databases. The Lync Server 2013 Management Shell used by the SQL Server administrator is installed on the Front End Server. This eliminates the need to install the Lync Server 2013 administrative tools on the SQL Server-based server.</p></td>
