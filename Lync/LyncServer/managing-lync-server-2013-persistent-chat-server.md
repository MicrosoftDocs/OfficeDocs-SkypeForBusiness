You can use Lync Server 2013, Persistent Chat Server to enable multiple users to participate in conversations in which they post and access content about specific topics, including text, links, and files. Although users can communicate in real time during a session, the content of each session is persistent, which means that it continues to be available after a session ends.

The content of Persistent Chat rooms consists primarily of short text messages, although it can include longer messages, referred to as *stories*, and also hyperlinks, emoticons, and uploaded documents.

<div>


> [!NOTE]  
> File upload and download is not supported by the Lync 2013 client; however, it is still supported by Lync Server 2013, Persistent Chat Server. The legacy Group Chat client can post and view files, but if the same chat room is accessed via the Lync 2013 client, it will not be able to access the files.



</div>

Access to a chat room is controlled by a membership list. The entire chat room history is available to any member for chronological review or full-text search. For details about using the Persistent Chat client, see [Planning for clients in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-planning-for-clients.md) in the Planning documentation, and [Deploying clients and devices in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-deploying-clients-and-devices.md) in the Deployment documentation.

When you set up Persistent Chat Server for your organization, you specify the initial configuration during deployment. However, there may be times when you want to change how you implement Persistent Chat Server support. For example, you may need to set up Persistent Chat Server support and controls differently for a specific team or group within your organization. This section provides information and procedures to help you customize your Persistent Chat Server deployment. For details about the features and functionality that you can configure for Persistent Chat Server, see [Defining your organization's requirements for Persistent Chat Server in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-defining-your-requirements-for-persistent-chat-server.md) in the Planning documentation, and [How Persistent Chat Server works in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-how-persistent-chat-server-works.md) in the Planning documentation, Deployment documentation, or Operations documentation. For details about deploying Persistent Chat Server for Lync Server 2013, see [Deploying Persistent Chat Server in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-deploying-persistent-chat-server.md) in the Deployment documentation.
