</div>

When you install the Mobility Service (Mcx) on Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.5, the Mobility Service installer configures some performance settings on the Front End Server. We recommend that you use IIS 7.5 for mobility. The settings affect the maximum number of concurrent user requests and the maximum number of threads that are allowed for the Mobility Service.

Here are the performance settings:

<div>

## Settings for Mcx on IIS 7.5

1.  **maxConcurrentThreadsPerCPU** is set to zero (0).

2.  **maxConcurrentRequestsPerCPU** is set to zero (0).

3.  ASP.NET process model is set to AutoConfig (for IIS 7.5 only).

4.  HTTP.sys queue limit is set to 1,000 (by default).
