In a mixed environment, if you create a new trusted application server after merging the legacy Office Communications Server topology with Lync Server 2013, and you define a new trusted application server using Topology Builder, you must set the next hop pool to be a Lync Server 2013 pool. In a merged environment, both the legacy Office Communications Server pool and the Lync Server 2013 pool appear in the drop down list. Selecting the legacy pool is *not* supported.

<div>

## To select Lync Server 2013 as next hop when creating a Trusted application server

1.  Open an existing topology in Topology Builder.

2.  In the left pane, right click **Trusted application servers** and click **New Trusted Application Pool**.

3.  Enter the **Pool FQDN** of the trusted application pool and select whether it will be a single-server or multiple-server deployment.

4.  Click **Next**.

5.  On the **Select the next hop** page, from the list, select the Lync Server 2013 Front End pool.

6.  Click **Finish**.

7.  Select the top node **Lync Server** and from the **Actions** pane, select **Publish**.

8.  Verify the **Trusted Application Pool** was created successfully and is associated with the correct Front End pool.
