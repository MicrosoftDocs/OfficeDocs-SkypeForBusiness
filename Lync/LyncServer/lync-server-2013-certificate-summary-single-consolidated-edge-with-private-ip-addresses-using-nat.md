_**Topic Last Modified:** 2012-10-22_

Microsoft Lync Server 2013 uses certificates to mutually authenticate other servers and to encrypt data from server to server and server to client. Certificates require name matching of the domain name system (DNS) records associated with the servers and the subject name (SN) and subject alternative name (SAN) on the certificate. To successfully map servers, DNS records and certificate entries, you must carefully plan your intended server fully qualified domain names as registered in DNS and the SN and SAN entries on the certificate.

The certificate assigned to the external interfaces of the Edge Server is requested from a public certification authority (CA). Public CAs that have demonstrated success in supplying certificates for the purposes of Unified Communications are listed in the following article: [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=3052\&kbid=929395](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=3052%26kbid=929395). When requesting the certificate, you can use the certificate request generated by the Lync Server Deployment Wizard or create the request manually using Lync Server Management Shell cmdlets or by a process provided by a public CA. For details on Lync Server Management Shell cmdlets for certificate management, see [Certificate and authentication cmdlets in Lync Server 2013](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/skype/) When assigning the certificate, the certificate is assigned to the Access Edge service interface, the Web Conferencing Edge service interface, and the Audio/Video Authentication service. The Audio/Video Authentication service should not be confused with the A/V Edge service which does not use a certificate to encrypt the audio and video streams. The internal Edge Server interface can use a certificate from an internal (to your organization) CA or a certificate from a public CA. The internal interface certificate uses only the SN and does not need or use SAN entries.

> [!NOTE]  
> The following table shows a second SIP entry (sip.fabrikam.com) in the subject alternative name list for reference. For each SIP domain in your organization, you need to add a corresponding FQDN listed in the certificate subject alternative name list.
