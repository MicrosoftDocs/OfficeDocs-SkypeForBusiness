If you deployed Archiving Server and Monitoring Server in your Office Communications Server 2007 R2, you can deploy these servers in your Lync Server 2013 environment after you migrate your Front End pools. If archiving and monitoring functionality are critical to your organization, however, you should add archiving and monitoring to your pilot pool before you migrate so that the functionality is available during the migration process.

If you want archiving and monitoring functionality during the migration and coexistence phase, keep the following considerations in mind:

  - Archiving data and monitoring data are not moved to the Lync Server 2013 deployment. The data you back up prior to decommissioning the legacy environment will be your history of activity in the Office Communications Server 2007 R2.

  - The Office Communications Server 2007 R2 version of Archiving Server and Monitoring Server can be associated only with a Office Communications Server 2007 R2 Front End pool. In Lync Server 2013, Archiving and Monitoring are no longer server roles, but services integrated into the Lync Server 2013 Front End pool.

  - During the time that your legacy and Lync Server 2013 deployments coexist, the Office Communications Server 2007 R2 version of Archiving Server and Monitoring Server gather data for users homed on Office Communications Server 2007 R2 pools. The Lync Server 2013 version of Archiving Server and Monitoring Server gather data for users homed on Lync Server 2013 pools.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > During the phase of migration when you are still using your legacy Edge server with the new Lync Server 2013 pilot pool, the Office Communications Server 2007 R2 version of Archiving Server continues to gather data for users homed on Office Communications Server 2007 R2 pools and the Lync Server 2013 version of Archiving Server gathers data for users homed on Lync Server 2013 pools.

  - If you use a third-party archiving and monitoring solution in conjunction with Archiving Server and Monitoring Server, talk to your vendor about when and how you need to integrate the third-party solution with Lync Server 2013.
