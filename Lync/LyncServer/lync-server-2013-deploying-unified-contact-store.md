_**Topic Last Modified:** 2016-06-06_

Enabling unified contact store in Lync Server 2013 does not require any topology settings. Enabling unified contact store for users requires the following:

  - Unified contact store policy is enabled (default is enabled).

  - Users log in with Lync 2013 at least once.

After a user’s contacts have been migrated, which happens automatically when a user logs in with Lync 2013, the user can access and manage their Lync contacts from Lync 2013, Outlook 2013, or Outlook Web Access. The user does not have to be logged in to Lync to manage their contacts from Outlook or Outlook Web Access.

<div>


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If a user logs in from Lync 2010 after migration, contacts and groups are available and up-to-date, but the user cannot manage (that is, add, delete, move, tag, untag, or modify) those contacts.
