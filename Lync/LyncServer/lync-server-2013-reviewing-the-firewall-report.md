Lync Server 2013 has a potentially complex set of firewall rules. The Planning Tool reduces this complexity by generating a report that defines in detail all firewall requirements, based on the designer’s input criteria. The IT firewall administrator will be able to use this report to configure and define the necessary rules.

From the standpoint of firewall management, the report should be carefully reviewed to make sure that there are no conflicts with exiting firewall rules and that there are no policies or procedures that might be violated.
