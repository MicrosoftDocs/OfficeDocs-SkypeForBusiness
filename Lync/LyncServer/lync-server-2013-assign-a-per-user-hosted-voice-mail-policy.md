# Assign a per-user hosted voice mail policy in Lync Server 2013

 


Deploying one or more per-user hosted voice mail policies is optional. If you do deploy per-user policies, you must explicitly assign them to users, groups, or contact objects.

For details about assigning or removing the assignment of per-user hosted voice mail policies, see the Lync Server Management Shell documentation for the following cmdlets:

  - Grant-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy

  - Remove-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy

## To assign a per-user hosted voice mail policy

1.  Start the Lync Server Management Shell: Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft Lync Server 2013**, and then click **Lync Server Management Shell**.

2.  Run the Grant-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy cmdlet to assign the per-user hosted voice mail policy to individual users, groups, and contact objects. For example, run:
    
        Grant-CsHostedVoicemailPolicy -Identity "Ken Myer" -PolicyName ExRedmond
    
    This example assigned the ExRedmond hosted voice mail policy to user Ken Myer.
    
    **Identity** specifies the user account to be modified. The Identity value can be specified using any of the following formats:
    
      - The user's SIP address
    
      - The user's Active Directory User-Principal-Name
    
      - The user's domain\\logon name (for example, contoso\\kenmyer)
    
      - The user's Active Directory Domain Services Display-Name (for example, Ken Myer). If using the Display-Name as the Identity value, you can use the asterisk (\*) wildcard character. For example, the Identity "\* Smith" returns all the users who have a Display-Name that ends with the string value "Smith".
    

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The user’s Active Directory SAM-Account-Name cannot be used as the Identity value because the SAM-Account-Name is not necessarily unique in the forest.
