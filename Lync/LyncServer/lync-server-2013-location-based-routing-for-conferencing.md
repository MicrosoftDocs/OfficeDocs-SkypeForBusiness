Location-Based Routing makes it possible to restrict the routing of calls between VoIP endpoints and PSTN endpoints based on the location of the parties in the call. With Cumulative Update 2 of Lync Server 2013, Location-Based Routing rules can be enforced on Lync meetings (i.e. conferences) to prevent PSTN toll bypass. The application monitors an active conference and enforces Location-Based Routing restrictions based on the location of users participating. The Location-Based Routing Conferencing application additionally enables the enforcement of Location-Based Routing restrictions to consultative transfers involving PSTN endpoints.
