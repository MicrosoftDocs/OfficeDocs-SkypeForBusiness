Call admission control (CAC) is a solution that determines whether a real-time session can be established based on the available bandwidth to help prevent poor audio/video quality for users on congested networks. CAC controls real-time traffic only for audio and video, and does not affect data traffic. CAC may route the call through an Internet path when the default WAN path does not have the required bandwidth. For details, see [Planning for call admission control in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-planning-for-call-admission-control.md) in the Planning documentation.

This section provides a set of example procedures that illustrate how to deploy and manage CAC in your network.

<div>


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before you deploy CAC, you must gather all of the required information for your enterprise network topology, as described in <A href="lync-server-2013-example-of-gathering-your-requirements-for-call-admission-control.md">Example: Gathering your requirements for call admission control in Lync Server 2013</A> in the Planning documentation. Also be sure that CAC components have been installed and activated, as described in <A href="lync-server-2013-define-and-configure-a-front-end-pool-or-standard-edition-server.md">Define and configure a Front End pool or Standard Edition server in Lync Server 2013</A> in the Deployment documentation.



</div>

<div>


> [!NOTE]  
> All CAC deployment and management examples in this section are performed by using the Lync Server Management Shell. As an alternative, you can also use the <STRONG>Network Configuration</STRONG> section of Lync Server Control Panel to manage CAC.
