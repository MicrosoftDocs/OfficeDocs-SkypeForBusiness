Before you deploy your perimeter network and implement support for external users, you must already have deployed your Microsoft Lync Server 2013 internal servers, including a Front End pool or a Standard Edition server. If you plan to deploy the optional Directors in your internal network, you should also deploy them prior to deploying Edge Servers. For details about the Director deployment process, see [Scenarios for the Director in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-scenarios-for-the-director.md) in the Planning documentation.

Microsoft Lync Server 2013 includes tools to facilitate planning and deployment of both internal servers and Edge Servers. After the topology is completed, publish the resulting topology definition to your production environment. To do this, you must be a member of the **Domain Admins** group and the **RTCUniversalServerAdmins** group.

  - **Planning Tool**   Office Communications Server 2007 R2 included a Planning Tool and an Edge Planning Tool that you could use to help guide topology design. In Lync Server 2010, these two tools were combined into a single Planning Tool that has additional features and functionality, such as collecting planned user count, voice requirements, external user access types, and federation options. Additionally, you can plan your infrastructure’s network parameters, such as IP addresses, load balancer types and other perimeter network considerations.

  - **Topology Builder**   Lync Server 2013 Topology Builder helps you define your topology and components. Topology Builder is essential to deploying servers running Lync Server 2013. Topology Builder publishes the results to a Central Management store that is used to configure all of the servers running Lync Server 2013 in your organization. You cannot install Lync Server 2013 on servers without using Topology Builder.

If you designed your edge topology during your planning process, including running Topology Builder to define your edge topology, you can use those results to start your Edge Server deployment. If you did not finish building your edge topology earlier or you want to change the information you previously specified, you must finish running Topology Builder before proceeding with other deployment steps. For details about how to build your topology, see [Scenarios for external user access in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-scenarios-for-external-user-access.md).

For details about the Planning Tool and Topology Builder, see [Beginning the planning process for Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-beginning-the-planning-process.md) in the Planning documentation.

The following table provides an overview of the Edge Server deployment process. To review the planning decisions that must be made before deploying external user access, see [Scenarios for external user access in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-scenarios-for-external-user-access.md).

<div>


> [!WARNING]  
> The information in the following table focuses on a new deployment. If you have deployed Edge Servers in a Lync Server 2010, Office Communications Server 2007 R2 or Office Communications Server 2007 environment, see the <A href="migration.md">Migration</A> for details about migrating to Lync Server 2013. Migration is not supported from any version prior to Office Communications Server 2007 R2, including Office Communications Server 2007, Live Communications Server 2005, and Live Communications Server 2003.

To enhance Edge Server performance and security, and to facilitate deployment, apply the following best practices when you deploy your perimeter network and Edge Servers:

  - Deploy Edge Servers only after you have tested and verified operation of Lync Server 2013 inside your organization.

  - We recommend that you deploy Edge Servers in a workgroup rather than a domain. Doing so simplifies installation and keeps Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) out of the perimeter network. Locating AD DS in the perimeter network can present a significant security risk.

  - Joining an Edge Server to a domain located entirely in the perimeter network is supported but not recommended. An Edge Server as part of the internal domain violates trusted network boundaries, where the Internet is least trusted, perimeter network is more trusted than the Internet, and the internal network is most trusted. An Edge server as a member of the domain is automatically a part of the most trusted network, but resides in a less trusted network (the perimeter).

> <P>As of September 1st, 2012, the Microsoft Lync Public IM Connectivity User Subscription License (“PIC USL”) is no longer available for purchase for new or renewing agreements. Customers with active licenses will be able to continue to federate with Yahoo! Messenger until the service shut down date. An end of life date of June 2014 for AOL and Yahoo! has been announced. For details, see <A href="lync-server-2013-support-for-public-instant-messenger-connectivity.md">Support for public instant messenger connectivity in Lync Server 2013</A>.</P>

> <P>The PIC USL is a per-user per-month subscription license that is required for Lync Server or Office Communications Server to federate with Yahoo! Messenger. Microsoft’s ability to provide this service has been contingent upon support from Yahoo!, the underlying agreement for which is winding down.</P>

> <P>More than ever, Lync is a powerful tool for connecting across organizations and with individuals around the world. Federation with Windows Live Messenger requires no additional user/device licenses beyond the Lync Standard CAL. Skype federation will be added to this list, enabling Lync users to reach hundreds of millions of people with IM and voice.</P></LI></UL>
