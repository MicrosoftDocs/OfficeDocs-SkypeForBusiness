When you connect to Skype for Business Online by using Windows PowerShell, a collection of Skype for Business Online cmdlets is copied, in memory, to your computer. These cmdlets, in addition to any other cmdlets you already have on your local computer (including the core cmdlets that are installed when you install Windows PowerShell), are then available for managing your Skype for Business Online deployment and your Skype for Business Online user accounts. The Skype for Business Online cmdlets are introduced in the following topics:
