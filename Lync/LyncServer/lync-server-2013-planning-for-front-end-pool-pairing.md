For the best disaster recovery abilities in Lync Server 2013, deploy pairs of Front End pools across two geographically dispersed sites. Each site contains a Front End pool which is paired with a corresponding Front End pool in the other site. Both sites are active, and the Lync Server Backup Service provides real-time data replication to keep the pools synchronized. The Backup Service is a new feature in Lync Server 2013, designed to support the disaster recovery solution. It is installed on a Front End pool when you pair the pool with another Front End pool.

If the pool in one site fails, you can fail over the users from that pool to the pool in the other site, which then provides services to all the users in both pools. For capacity planning purposes, each pool should be designed to handle the workloads of all users in both pools in the event of a disaster.
