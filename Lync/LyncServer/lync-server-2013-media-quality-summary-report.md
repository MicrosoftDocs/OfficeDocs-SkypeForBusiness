_**Topic Last Modified:** 2016-06-29_

The Media Quality Summary Report is perhaps your best bet for analyzing call quality in your organization: this report provides detailed Quality of Experience (QoE) call metrics broken down into the following categories:

  - UC Peer to Peer Calls (such as a Microsoft Lync 2013 to Microsoft Lync 2013 call)

  - UC Conference Sessions

  - PSTN Conference Sessions

  - PSTN Calls: Media Bypass

  - PSTN Calls (Non-Bypass): UC Leg

  - PSTN Calls (Non-Bypass): Gateway Leg

  - Other Call Types

When you first open the report, you see summary information for each of these categories. Without leaving the report, you can expand each category to look at subcategories such as calls made from Office Communicator 2007 R2 to Lync 2013. In turn, you can then drill down into these subcategories to see details about each call made within that subcategory.

In Microsoft Lync Server 2013 the Media Quality Summary Report further breaks the data down into three call types: audio calls, video calls, and application sharing calls. Each call type has its own section in the report, and its own custom set of call metrics.

The Media Quality Summary Report also allows you to apply filters that enable you to compare the call quality of wired calls vs. wireless calls, internal calls vs. external calls, and VPN calls vs. non-VPN calls.

## Accessing the Media Quality Summary Report

The Media Quality Summary Report is accessed from the Monitoring Reports home page. You can drill down to the [Call List Report in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-call-list-report.md) by clicking either of the following metrics:

  - Call volume

  - Poor call percentage

In addition, you can access the Media Quality Metrics Distribution Report by clicking any of the following audio call metrics:

  - Round trip (ms)

  - Degradation (MOS)

  - Packet loss

  - Jitter (ms)

  - Healer concealed ratio

  - Healer stretched ratio

  - Healer compressed ratio

## Filters

Filters provide a way for you to return a more finely-targeted set of data or to view the returned data in different ways. For example, the Media Quality Summary Report enables you to filter the returned data by such things as access type (that is, interval access vs. external access) or by wired/wireless network connection. You can also choose how data should be grouped. In this case, calls are grouped by hour, day, week, or month.

The following table lists the filters that you can use with the Media Quality Summary Report.

A value of 0.5 or less represents acceptable degradation. Historically, mean options scores were calculated by having users rate the quality of a call on a scale of 1-to-5. In Lync Server, Lync Server uses a set of algorithms to predict how users would have rated a call.</p>
