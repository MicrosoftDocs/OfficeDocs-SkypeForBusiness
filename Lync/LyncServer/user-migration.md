A generally accepted best practice for migrations is to create several test users and use them to conduct systems tests. After you have successfully moved and tested those accounts, you should identify a group of pilot production users and move their accounts and conduct validation tests on them. When you get satisfactory results, you can move the rest of your users to the new deployment.

For additional information on enabling users for Lync Server 2013, see the topic [Disable or re-enable user account for Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-disable-or-re-enable-user-account-for-lync-server.md) in the Deploying Lync Server 2013 documentation.
