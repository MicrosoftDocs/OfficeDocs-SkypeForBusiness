The Lync Server 2013 ExUM Routing application supports integration with Exchange Unified Messaging (UM) in an on-premises environment, where Lync Server 2013 and Exchange UM are both installed locally within your enterprise, or in with Exchange UM hosted by a service provider, as shown in the following diagram.

The following modes are supported:

  - **On-premises Mode**   Lync Server 2013 and Exchange UM are both deployed on local servers within your enterprise.

  - **Cross-premises Mode**   Lync Server 2013 is deployed on local servers within your enterprise and Exchange UM is hosted in an online service provider’s facility, such as a Microsoft Exchange Online data center.

  - **Mixed Mode**   Your Lync Server 2013 deployment has some user mailboxes homed on local servers running Microsoft Exchange Server within your enterprise and some mailboxes homed in a hosted Exchange service data center.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Mixed mode can be used as a transitional solution during evaluation and stepwise migration of users to hosted Exchange UM, or as a permanent solution if you opt to keep some users’ Exchange UM services on-premises after migrating others.

    
    </div>

To integrate Lync Server 2013 with hosted Exchange UM, you must configure a *shared SIP address space* (also called a *split domain*). In this configuration, both Lync Server 2013 and the third-party hosted Exchange UM service provider can access the same SIP domain address space. For details, see [Hosted Exchange UM integration architecture in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-hosted-exchange-um-integration-architecture.md) in the Planning documentation.
