The Location-Based Routing Conferencing application relies on the configuration of Lync Server 2013 Location-Based Routing. The main configurations are the following:

  - The location of participants joining a meeting is determined based on their network site. A network site and its associated network subnets must be defined in Lync Server in order to enforce Location-Based Routing.

  - To enforce Location-Based Routing of meetings, Lync participants must be enabled for Location-Based Routing.

  - To enforce Location-Based Routing of PSTN endpoints joining meetings, the SIP trunk used to connect the PSTN endpoints must be configured for Location-Based Routing.

For additional information on deploying and configuring Lync Server 2013 Location-Based Routing, please refer Configuring [Location-Based Routing](lync-server-2013-configuring-location-based-routing.md).

## Enabling the Location-Based Routing Conferencing Application

The Location-Based Routing Conferencing application is disabled by default. Before enabling this application, you need to determine the right priority to assign for the application. To determine this priority, run the following cmdlet in Lync Server Management Shell:

Get-CsServerApplication -Identity Service:Registrar:\<Pool FQDN\>

In this cmdlet, \<Pool FQDN\> is the pool in which the Location-Based Routing Conferencing application is to be enabled.

This cmdlet will return the list of the applications hosted by Lync Server and the priority value for each of them. The Location-Based Routing Conferencing application needs to be assigned a priority value larger than the “UdcAgent” application and smaller than the “DefaultRouting”, “ExumRouting” and “OutboundRouting” applications. We recommend that you assign the Location-Based Routing Conferencing application a priority value that is one point higher than the priority value of the “UdcAgent” application.

For example, if the “UdcAgent” application has a priority value of “2”, the “DefaultRouting” application has a priority value of “8”, the “ExumRouting” application has a priority value of “9” and the “OutboundRouting” application has a priority value of “10” then you should assign the Location-Based Routing Conferencing application a priority value of “3”. Doing so would place the priority of the applications in the following order: Other applications (Priorities: 0 to 1), “UdcAgent” (Priority: 2), Location-Based Routing Conferencing application (Priority: 3), other applications (Priorities: 4 to 8), “DefaultRouting” (Priority: 9), “ExumRouting” (Priority: 10) and “OutboundRouting” (Priority: 11).

After you find the correct priority value for the Location-Based Routing Conferencing application, type the following cmdlet for each Front-End pool or Standard Edition Server that homes users enabled for Location-Based Routing:

New-CsServerApplication -Identity Service:Registrar:\<Pool FQDN\>/LBRouting -Priority \<Application Priority\> -Enabled $true -Critical $true -Uri http://www.microsoft.com/LCS/LBRouting

For example:

New-CsServerApplication -Identity Service:Registrar:LS2013CU2LBRPool.contoso.com/LBRouting -Priority 3 -Enabled $true -Critical $true -Uri http://www.microsoft.com/LCS/LBRouting

After using this cmdlet, restart all Front End servers in the pool or the Standard Edition Servers where the Location-Based Routing Conferencing application has been enabled.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Location-Based Routing enforcements to conferences or consultative transfers won’t be enforced until all the Front End Servers in the applicable pools or the Standard Edition Servers are restarted.



</div>

Once the Location-Based Routing Conferencing application has been successfully enabled and all applicable Lync servers have been restarted, all conferences organized by Lync users enabled for Location-Based Routing will be monitored to prevent PSTN toll bypass
