The Media Quality Metrics Distribution Report enables you to see a graph that shows the distribution values for a Quality of Experience metric such as jitter or packet loss. For example, suppose your users make a total of 10 phone calls; those 10 calls report the following roundtrip times:


<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Call Number</th>
<th>Roundtrip Time (milliseconds)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>1</p></td>
<td><p>50</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>2</p></td>
<td><p>50</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>3</p></td>
<td><p>50</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>4</p></td>
<td><p>50</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>5</p></td>
<td><p>50</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>6</p></td>
<td><p>50</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>7</p></td>
<td><p>50</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>8</p></td>
<td><p>4550</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>9</p></td>
<td><p>50</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>10</p></td>
<td><p>50</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


The average for those roundtrip times is 500 milliseconds (5000 divided by 10). Five hundred milliseconds is an extremely large roundtrip time; as a result, you might believe that you have a serious problem with network congestion. (Long roundtrip times are typically the result of overloaded networks.)

In reality, of course, 90% of your calls had excellent round trip times; you merely had one bad call that skewed the overall results. If you only look at the average roundtrip time you might jump to a very wrong conclusion.

The Media Quality Metrics Distribution Report helps you avoid jumping to wrong conclusions by showing you a graphical distribution of a specified metric (such as round trip time). These graphs can help make it clear that you had nine very good calls and one very bad call. Admittedly, you might still want to further investigate that one call; however, the fact that 9 out of the 10 calls were very good suggests that there is no reason to make any drastic changes to your network, at least not at this point in time.
