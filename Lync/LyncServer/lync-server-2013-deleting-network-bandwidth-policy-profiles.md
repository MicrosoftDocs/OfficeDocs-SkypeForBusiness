You can use the Lync Server Control Panel to create, modify, or delete a container profile for these policies. Use the following procedures to delete a network bandwidth policy profiles. For details on creating or modifying a network bandwidth policy profile, see [Creating or modifying bandwidth policy profiles in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-creating-or-modifying-bandwidth-policy-profiles.md).
