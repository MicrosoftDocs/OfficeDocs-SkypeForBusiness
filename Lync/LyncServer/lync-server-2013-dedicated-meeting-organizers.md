_**Topic Last Modified:** 2012-10-01_

To minimize the real-time communications traffic in the large-meeting pool, we do not recommend hosting users who regularly sign in using Lync clients and participate in instant messaging (IM), presence, conferencing, and voice sessions. Instead, we recommend doing one of the following:

  - Create one or more dedicated user accounts just for scheduling large meetings, or

  - Home the user accounts of the staff responsible for scheduling large meetings on a large-meeting pool.

In either case, the user accounts that are homed on the large-meeting pool should not be used to regularly sign in to Lync, other than to schedule meetings.
