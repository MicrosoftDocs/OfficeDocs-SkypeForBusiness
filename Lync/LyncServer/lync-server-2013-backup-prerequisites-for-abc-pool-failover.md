To get the maximum benefit from using the ABC pool failover procedure, you must perform certain backups before the disaster and failover happen:

  - You must regularly back up the Location Information Service (LIS) configuration data from pool A by using the **Export-CsLISConfiguration** cmdlet.
    
        Export-csLisConfiguration -FileName <C:\LISExportPrimary.zip>

  - You must regularly back up the Response Group configuration data in pool A by using the **Export-CsRgsConfiguration** cmdlet.
    
        Export-CsRgsConfiguration -Source "service:ApplicationServer:<Pool A FQDN>" -FileName "C:\RgsExportPrimary.zip"
    
    In general, we recommend that you perform daily backups, but if you have a high volume of changes, you might want to schedule more frequent backups. The amount of information that you can lose in the event of a disaster depends on the frequency of your backups, as well as on the frequency and volume of changes.
    
    The Response Group application can store only one set of application-level settings per pool. These settings can be accessed through the **Get-CsRgsConfiguration** cmdlets. The settings include the default music-on-hold configuration, the default music-on-hold audio file, the agent ring-back grace period, and the call context configuration. These settings can be transferred from one pool to another through the **Import-CsRgsConfiguration** cmdlet by using the **ReplaceExistingSettings** parameter, but this operation will override any application-level settings in the destination pool.

    > [!TIP]  
    > In a separate location, keep a backup copy of all the original audio files that have been used to configure the Response Group application (that is, any recordings or music-on-hold files).

    
    </div>
    
    If you have any customized music-on-hold files that have been uploaded for Call Park in a pool, you should keep a copy of these in another location. These files are not backed up as part of the Lync Server 2013 disaster recovery process, and they will be lost if the files uploaded to the pool are damaged, corrupted, or erased.
    
        Xcopy  <Source: Pool A CPS File Store Path>  <Destination>
        Example: Xcopy  "<Pool A File Store Path>\LyncFileStore\coX-ApplicationServer-X\AppServerFiles\CPS\"  "<Destination:  Backup location 1>"
    
    <div>
    

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The Call Park application can store only one set of settings and one customized music-on-hold audio file per pool. These settings can be accessed through the <STRONG>Get-CsCpsConfiguration</STRONG> cmdlet. Because the disaster recovery mechanism for Call Park relies on the Call Park application of the backup pool, the settings of the primary pool are not backed up or preserved if a disaster occurs. If the primary pool is lost, these settings cannot be recovered, and when a new pool is deployed to replace the primary pool, the Call Park settings and any customized music-on-hold audio file would need to be reconfigured.

  - If you configure any announcements as part of the Unassigned Number Voice Feature, we recommend that you keep in another location a copy of any original audio file used during the initial configuration. If you did not do that, you can get a copy of the configured audio files in the file store of the server or pool to which the audio files were imported. These files are not backed up as part of the Lync Server 2013 disaster recovery process, and they will be lost if the files uploaded to the pool are damaged, corrupted, or erased. To copy all the audio files used to configure the Unassigned Number Voice Feature from the file store of a server or a pool, use:
    
        Use: Xcopy  <Source: Pool A Announcement Service File Store Path>  <Destination>
        Example Usage:  Xcopy  "<Pool A File Store Path>\X-ApplicationServer-X\AppServerFiles\RGS\AS"  "<Destination: Backup location>"

  - If you have Monitoring and Archiving databases in a pool, you should use SQL Server management tools to back them up. In the ABC failover procedure, Monitoring and Archiving databases are not preserved if they are collocated in pool A, because these databases are not backed up through Lync Server Backup Service.
