Lync Server 2013 introduces Voice mail Escape, an enhancement for managing voice mail. This new feature can detect when a call has been routed to voice mail, and prevent the call from being immediately routed to the user’s mobile phone voice mail without giving the user the opportunity to answer the call. This scenario occurs when the user enables simultaneous ringing to their mobile phone, and their mobile phone is turned off, out of battery, or out of range. Voicemail Escape detects that the call was immediately answered by the user’s mobile phone voice mail, and disconnects the call to the mobile phone voice mail. The call continues to ring on the user’s other endpoints giving the user the opportunity to answer the call. If the user does not answer the call, then the call is routed to the corporate voice mail.
