_**Topic Last Modified:** 2013-02-12_

Cumulative Updates for Lync Server 2013: February 2013 introduces Group Call Pickup as a new Enterprise Voice feature. With Group Call Pickup, you can assign users to groups so that other users can answer incoming calls to users who are in the group from their own phones.

Group Call Pickup is based on the Call Park application. For Group Call Pickup, as with Call Park, you set up a range of virtual numbers to be used as group numbers. A user dials the group number to pick up a call that is ringing for another user who is in the group.
