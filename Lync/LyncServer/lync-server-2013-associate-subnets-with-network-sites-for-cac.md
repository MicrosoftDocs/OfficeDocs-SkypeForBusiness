Every subnet in your network must be associated with a specific network site. This is because subnet information is used to determine the network site on which an endpoint is located. When the locations of both parties in a session are known, call admission control (CAC) can determine if there is sufficient bandwidth to establish a call.

Call admission control does not have any special requirements for associating subnets with network sites. To create an association between the subnets and network sites in your topology, follow the procedures in [Associate a subnet with a network site in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-associate-a-subnet-with-a-network-site.md). To view the network sites (and their respective subnets) in the example network topology for call admission control, see [Example: Gathering your requirements for call admission control in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-example-of-gathering-your-requirements-for-call-admission-control.md) in the Planning documentation.
