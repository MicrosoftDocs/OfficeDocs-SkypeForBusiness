Lync Server 2013 includes support for IPv6 addresses. Due to an increasing number of devices requiring IP addresses, the number of available IPv4 addresses, which are 32-bit addresses, is running out. IPv6 provides a much larger number of available addresses, because it uses 128-bit addresses. Use of IPv6 addresses in your environment depends on support for IPv6 in the devices you use.

Because many existing devices do not yet support IPv6, a complete transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is likely to take several years. Therefore, Lync Server 2013 includes support for network environments with only IPv4 addresses, only IPv6 addresses, and dual-stack (both IPv4 and IPv6) addresses.
