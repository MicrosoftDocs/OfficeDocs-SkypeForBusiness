Conferencing policy defines the features and capabilities that users have available during a conference (also known as a meeting). Conferencing policy settings encompass a wide variety of scheduling and participation options, ranging from whether a meeting can include IP audio and video to the maximum number of people who can attend. Administrators can use conferencing policy to manage security, bandwidth, and legal aspects of meetings.

You can define conferencing policy on three levels: global scope, site scope, and user scope. Settings apply to a specific user from the narrowest scope to the widest scope. If you assign a user policy to a user, those settings take precedence. If you do not assign a user policy, site settings apply. If no user or site policies apply, global policy provides the default settings.

A global policy exists by default, so you cannot create a new global policy. You also cannot delete the existing global policy, but you can change the existing global policy to customize your default settings.
