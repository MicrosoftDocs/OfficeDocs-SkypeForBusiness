## Description

In Lync Server 2013, a data conference is any conference where collaborative activities such as whiteboarding or annotations are used. The **Test-CsDataConference** cmdlet enables you to verify that a pair of users are able to take part in a data conference.

</div>

<div>

## Running the test

The command shown in Example 1 verifies that a data conference can be conducted on the pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com. This command assumes that you have configured a pair of test users for the specified pool. If no such test users exist, the command will fail.

    Test-CsDataConference -TargetFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" 

The commands shown in Example 2 test the ability of a pair of users (litwareinc\\pilar and litwareinc\\kenmyer) to log on to Lync Server 2013 and then conduct a data conference. To do this, the first command in the example uses the **Get-Credential** cmdlet to create a Windows PowerShell command-line interface credential object containing the name and password of the user Pilar Ackerman. (Because the logon name, litwareinc\\pilar, has been included as a parameter, the Windows PowerShell Credential Request dialog box only requires the administrator to enter the password for the Pilar Ackerman account.) The resulting credential object is then stored in a variable named $cred1. The second command does the same thing, this time returning a credential object for the Ken Myer account.

With the credential objects in hand, the third command determines whether or not these two users can log on to Lync Server 2013 and conduct a data conference. To carry out this task, the **Test-CsDataConference** cmdlet is called, along with the following parameters: TargetFqdn (the FQDN of the Registrar pool); SenderSipAddress (the SIP address for the first test user); SenderCredential (the Windows PowerShell object containing the credentials for this same user); ReceiverSipAddress (the SIP address for the other test user); and ReceiverCredential (the Windows PowerShell object containing the credentials for the other test user).

    $credential1 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\pilar" 
    $credential2 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\kenmyer" 
    Test-CsDataConference -TargetFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -SenderSipAddress "sip:pilar@litwareinc.com" -SenderCredential $credential1 -ReceiverSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -ReceiverCredential $credential2

## Determining success or failure

If data conferencing is correctly configured, you'll receive output similar to this, with the Result property marked as **Success:**

Target Fqdn : atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com

Result : Success

Latency : 00:00:00

Error Message :

Diagnosis :

If the specified users can't use data sharing, the Result will be shown as **Failure**, and additional information will be recorded in the Error and Diagnosis properties:

Target Fqdn : atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com

Result : Failure

Latency : 00:00:00

Error Message : 10060, A connection attempt failed because the connected party

did not properly respond after a period of time, or

established connection failed because connected host has

failed to respond \[2001:4898:e8:f39e:5c9a:ad83:81b3:9944\]:5061

Inner Exception:A connection attempt failed because the

connected party did not properly respond after a period of

time, or established connection failed because connected host

has failed to respond

\[2001:4898:e8:f39e:5c9a:ad83:81b3:9944\]:5061

## Reasons why the test might have failed

Here are some common reasons why **Test-CsDataConference** might fail:

  - An incorrect parameter value was supplied. If used, the optional parameters must be configured correctly or the test will fail. Rerun the command without the optional parameters and see whether that succeeds.

  - The ability to conduct a data conference depends on the conferencing policy that has been assigned to the user who organized the conference (in the case of the **Test-CsDataConference** cmdlet, that is the "sender"). If the organizer is not allowed to include collaborative activities in his or her meeting (for example, if his or her conferencing policy has the EnableDataCollaboration property set to False) then the **Test-CsDataConference** cmdlet will fail.

  - This command will fail if the Edge Server is misconfigured or not yet deployed.
