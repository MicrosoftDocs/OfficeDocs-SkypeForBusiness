The Device Report might be better titled the Microphone and Speakers Report; that's because the Device Report retrieves call-related metrics (such as poor call percentage, echo, and voice switch time) grouped by the microphones and speakers used in the call. If you are interested in IP phones (also commonly referred to as "devices"), use the [IP Phone Inventory Report in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-ip-phone-inventory-report.md) instead.

The Device Report is extremely useful for administrators in determining if a specific type of device is experiencing high volumes of poor quality calls than others. In turn, this could influence any decisions you must make when it comes time to buy new devices or to replace existing devices.

By default, the information displayed in the Device Report is also based on the microphone (the capture device) and speakers/headset (the render device) used in the call. For example, suppose you have several users who use the following capture device and the following render device: By default, the information displayed in the Device Report is also based on the microphone (the capture device) and speakers/headset (the render device) used in the call. For example, suppose you have several users who use the following capture device and the following render device:

  - Capture device -- Microphone (SoundMAX Integrated Digital HD Audio)

  - Render device -- Headset Earphone (Microsoft LifeChat LX-3000)

If those users made a total of 254 calls you'll see an entry like this in the report:


<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Capture device</th>
<th>Render device</th>
<th>Call volume</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Microphone (SoundMAX Integrated Digital HD Audio)</p></td>
<td><p>Headset Earphone (Microsoft LifeChat LX-3000)</p></td>
<td><p>254</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


Now, suppose you have a number of users who use that same capture device but a different render device. In that case, you'll have a second line entry in the report, one for that unique combination of capture device and render device:


<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Capture device</th>
<th>Render device</th>
<th>Call volume</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Microphone (SoundMAX Integrated Digital HD Audio)</p></td>
<td><p>Headset Earphone (Microsoft LifeChat LX-3000)</p></td>
<td><p>254</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Microphone (SoundMAX Integrated Digital HD Audio)</p></td>
<td><p>Speakers (SoundMAX Integrated Digital HD Audio)</p></td>
<td><p>319</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


If you would rather see combined totals for a given device (for example, for the SoundMAX capture device, regardless of the render device used), select the appropriate option from the Device type dropdown list (either Capture device or Render device). If you select Capture device in this example, that will give you output similar to this:


<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Capture device</th>
<th>Call volume</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Microphone (SoundMAX Integrated Digital HD Audio)</p></td>
<td><p>573</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Accessing the Device Report

The Device Report is typically accessed from the Monitoring Reports home page. However, if you are viewing the [Call Detail Report in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-call-detail-report.md) you can drill down to the Device Report for a specific device by clicking either of the following metrics:

  - Capture Device

  - Render Device

From the Device Report you can drill down to the [Call List Report in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-call-list-report.md) by clicking either of the following metrics:

  - Call volume

  - Poor call percentage

</div>

<div>

## Making the Best Use of the Device Report

When it comes to device names, the Device Report is extremely detailed; for example, suppose you have the following capture devices:

  - Aastra 3002 Microphone (2- Aastra 3002)

  - Aastra 3002 Microphone (3- Aastra 3002)

  - Aastra 3002 Microphone (Aastra 3002)

  - Aastra 6725ip

  - Aastra 6725ip Microphone (10- Aastra 6725ip)

  - Aastra 6725ip Microphone (10- Aastra 6725ip)-V0

  - Aastra 6725ip Microphone (2- Aastra 6725ip)

  - Aastra 6725ip Microphone (3- Aastra 6725ip)

  - Aastra 6725ip Microphone (4- Aastra 6725ip)

  - Aastra 6725ip Microphone (5- Aastra 6725ip)

  - Aastra 6725ip Microphone (6- Aastra 6725ip)

  - Aastra 6725ip Microphone (7- Aastra 6725ip)

  - Aastra 6725ip Microphone (9- Aastra 6725ip)

  - Aastra 6725ip Microphone (9- Aastra 6725ip)-V0

  - Aastra 6725ip Microphone (Aastra 6725ip)

  - Aastra 6725ip Microphone (Aastra 6725ip)-V0

  - Aastra 6725ip Microphone (USB Audio Device)

  - Aastra 6725ip Microphone (USB Audio Device)-V0

<div>


> [!NOTE]  
> Keep in mind that capture device names might not be the same if you are running localized versions of Lync Server 2013. A device named Aastra 6725ip Microphone (Aastra 6725ip)-V0 in US English could have a different name in French or Spanish.



</div>

Often times you'll want that level of detail; at other times, however, you might only be interested in how many calls use any Aastra microphone, regardless of model number. One way to get information like that is to export the Device Report data to Microsoft Excel and then save that data to a comma-separated values file (for example, C:\\Data\\Devices\_Report.csv). You can then use a set of commands similar to these to import the .CSV file into Windows PowerShell and report back the total number of calls made using an Aastra capture device:

    $devices = Import-Csv "C:\Data\Device_Report.csv
    $sum = $devices | Where-Object {$_."Capture device" -match "Aastra"}
    $sum | foreach-object {[Int]$x = [Int]$x + [Int]$_."call volume"}
    $x

That will return a single value representing the total number of calls made using an Aastra capture device. For example:

    384

## Filters

Filters provide a way for you to return a more finely-targeted set of data or to view the returned data in different ways. For example, the Device Report enables you to filter on such things as call type (that is, was the call a client call), a conference call, or a public switched telephone network (PSTN) call. You can also choose how data should be grouped. In this case, devices are grouped by hour, day, week, or month.

The following table lists the filters that you can use with the Device Report.
