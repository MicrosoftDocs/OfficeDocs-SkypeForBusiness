Before checking the performance, availability, and functionality of the Lync Server 2013 deployment, you should check the physical environment. For example, the server room temperature might have to be lowered, or a network cable might have to be replaced. For best results, perform the following physical environmental inspections:

  - **Physical security measures**   Physical security protection such as locks, doors, and restricted-access rooms must be secured. Check for any unauthorized and forced entries and signs of equipment damage.

  - **Temperature and humidity**   High temperature, poor air flow, and humidity can cause hardware components to overheat. Check temperature and humidity to help to make sure that the environmental systems such as heating and air conditioning can maintain acceptable conditions and function within the hardware manufacturer's specifications. When new equipment has recently been installed, also check that air flow both to and from the servers is unimpeded and meets manufacturer spec.

  - **Devices and components**   The Lync Server 2013 organization relies on a functioning physical network and related hardware. Make sure that routers, switches, hubs, physical cables, and connectors are operational.

The specifics on how to perform these checks will depend greatly on your installation site and the server hardware that was chosen. The first time that you perform this check, refer to the hardware documentation and note the desired parameters for future reference.
