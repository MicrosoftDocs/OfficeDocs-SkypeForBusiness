Response Group is an Enterprise Voice feature that routes and queues incoming calls to groups of people, called *agents*, such as a help desk or a customer service desk.

The components that Response Group requires are installed and enabled automatically on the Front End Server or Standard Edition server when you deploy Enterprise Voice. To make Response Group available to users, you must configure agent groups, then queues, and then workflows. Additionally, a Response Group Administrator can delegate configuration of an existing workflow to a Response Group Manager, who can then modify and reconfigure the workflow and its associated agent groups and queues.

This section guides you through the configuration of Lync Server 2013 Response Group. It assumes that you have already read the planning sections related to Response Group and have deployed an Enterprise Edition server or a Standard Edition server with Enterprise Voice.
