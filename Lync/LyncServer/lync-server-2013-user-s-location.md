Location-Based Routing leverages the same network regions, sites and subnets as defined in Lync Server used by E9-1-1, CAC and Media Bypass to apply call routing restrictions to prevent PSTN toll bypass. A user’s location is determined by the IP subnet of the user’s Lync endpoint(s) are connected from. Each IP subnet is associated to a network site, which are aggregated into network regions defined by the administrator. Location-Based Routing is enforced based on the user’s network site.

Location-Based Routing rules are applied on a per network site basis, meaning that a given set of rules will be applied to all endpoints enabled for Location-Based Routing that are located within the same network site. Administrators can apply Location-Based Routing to network sites that require it.

Voice routing policies can be defined on a per network site basis to define a particular PSTN gateway that should be used by all users located in the network site to call PSTN phone numbers. Such voice routing policies will take precedence over the routing defined by the user’s voice policy when the user is located in a network site enabled for Location-Based Routing, and it will prevent the routing of calls via other PSTN gateways that are enabled for Location-Based Routing. When a Lync user places a PSTN call, the user’s voice policy determines whether the user can be authorized to place the call. If the user’s voice policy allows the user to place the call, Location-Based Routing determines which PSTN gateway the call should egress from. Location-Based Routing makes this determination based on the user’s location.

A user location can be categorized in the following ways:

  - The user is located in a known network site enabled for Location-Based Routing and his DID (Direct Inward Dial) number terminates on a PSTN gateway placed in the same network site (i.e. office). The routing of outbound calls will be through the voice routing policy of the network site in which the user is located. Incoming PSTN calls to the user are routed to endpoints that are located in the same network site as the PSTN gateway.

  - The user is located in a known network site that is in different from the network site where the PSTN gateway is located. (i.e. the user traveled to another corporate office). The routing of outbound calls will be using the voice routing policy of the network site in which the user is located. Incoming PSTN calls to the user will not be routed to endpoints that are located in different sites than the PSTN gateway to prevent PSTN toll bypassing.

  - When a user is located in a network site that is unknown to the Lync Server deployment, the routing of outbound calls will be based on the voice policy assigned to the user to PSTN gateways not bound to Location-Based Routing restrictions. Incoming PSTN calls will not be routed to endpoints that are located in unknown network sites to prevent PSTN toll bypassing.
