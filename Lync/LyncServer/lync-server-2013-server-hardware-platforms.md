_**Topic Last Modified:** 2016-07-28_

Lync Server 2013 server roles and computers running Lync Server administrative tools require 64-bit hardware.

The specific hardware used for Lync Server 2013 deployment can vary, depending on size and usage requirements. This section describes the recommended hardware. Although these are recommendations, not requirements, using hardware that does not meet these recommendations may result in significant performance issues and other issues.

<div>

## Recommended Hardware Platform

For best performance, we recommend that you run Lync Server on servers with hardware that meets the requirements in the following table. If you use less powerful hardware, you may experience functionality problems or poor performance. Note that these hardware requirements are higher than those of previous versions of Lync Server, primarily because in Lync Server 2013, all Front End Servers run SQL Server.

> [!NOTE]  
> NIC teaming is supported and should be transparent to Lync Server. For details, see <A href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=389910">Communications Server or Lync Server and network adapter teaming</A>.
