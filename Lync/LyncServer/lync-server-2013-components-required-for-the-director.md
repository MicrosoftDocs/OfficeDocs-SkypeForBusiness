The only component required to create and configure a Director is to deploy the Director server role. You do this by using Topology Builder and define either a single computer pool or a multiple computer pool in the Director pool node. After you have defined the Director or Director pool, run the Lync Server Deployment Wizard on the computer that will be a Director. In the case of a Director pool, you run the Lync Server Deployment Wizard on each server that will be a member of the pool.

## Topologies

You can implement a single Director server or a Director pool. The Director is always a separate server or pool, not collocated with any other server role in Lync Server 2013.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you do not deploy Directors, the Front End Server or Front End pool will assume the Director role.

A pool of Directors must be load balanced. You can do one of the following:

  - Create a topology that uses a hardware load balancer for web services and Domain Name System (DNS) load balancing for the other traffic types.

  - Create a topology that uses a hardware load balancer for load balancing needed for the Director pool.
