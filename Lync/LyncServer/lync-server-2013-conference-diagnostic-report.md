_**Topic Last Modified:** 2012-10-22_

The Conference Diagnostic Report provides information about the success and failure of all conferencing sessions. Note that Microsoft Lync Server distinguishes between different kinds of failure:

  - **Expected failure**. An expected failure is typically a failure only in the most technical sense. For example, suppose someone starts a conference but hangs up before anyone can join. Technically that's a failure: the conference was initiated, but not completed. However, that's a failure that you would expect to happen: if the organizer cancels the conference before anyone can join then you would not expect that conference to be completed.

  - **Unexpected failure**. An unexpected error is exactly what the name implies: an error that, based on the circumstances, you would not expect to occur. For example, suppose a conference could not be held because the organizer's meeting policy could not be retrieved. That's an unexpected error: after all, you should always be able to retrieve a user's meeting policy.

Note that the Success, Expected failure, and Unexpected failure metrics might not add up to the Total sessions metric. For example, you might see the following values in the Report:


<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Successes</th>
<th>Expected failures</th>
<th>Unexpected failures</th>
<th>Total sessions</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>2024</p></td>
<td><p>469</p></td>
<td><p>16</p></td>
<td><p>2521</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


If you add 2024 + 469 + 16 you get a total of 2,509 sessions and yet, the Total sessions column shows a total of 2,521 sessions. The "missing" 12 sessions for are sessions that the system was unable to categorize as successful or unsuccessful. That will sometimes be the case when a third-party product introduces a new diagnostic code that is unfamiliar to Monitoring Server. When that happens, calls made using that product, and reporting that diagnostic code, cannot always be categorized as being a Success, an Expected failure, or an Unexpected failure.

## Accessing the Conference Diagnostic Report

The Conference Diagnostic Report is accessed from the Monitoring Reports home page. You can access the [Failure Distribution Report in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-failure-distribution-report.md) by clicking either of the following metrics:

  - Unexpected failure volume

  - Expected failure volume

</div>

<div>

## Making the Best Use of the Conference Diagnostic Report

The Conference Diagnostic Report includes a series of graphs. Each of the columns shown in the graph is actually a hyperlink. If you click a column, you'll drill down to the [Failure Distribution Report in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-failure-distribution-report.md) for that time period and that conference type.

## Filters

Filters provide a way for you to return a more finely-targeted set of data or to view the returned data in different ways. For example, the Conference Diagnostic Report enables you to filter on such things as the type of conference being conducted (for example, a Focus-based conference) or by the Edge Server used in the conference. You can also choose how data should be grouped. In this case, conferences are grouped by hour, day, week, or month.

The following table lists the filters that you can use with the Conference Diagnostic Report.

### Conference Diagnostic Report Filters

<p>7/7/2012 1:00 PM</p>
<p>If you do not enter a start time, the report automatically begins at 12:00 AM on the specified day. To view data by day, enter just the date:</p>
<p>7/7/2012</p>
<p>To view by week or by month, enter a date that falls anywhere within the week or month that you want to view (you do not have to enter the first day of the week or month):</p>
<p>7/3/2012</p>
<p>Weeks always run from Sunday through Saturday.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>To</strong></p></td>
<td><p>End date/time for the time range. To view data by hours, enter both the end date and time as follows:</p>
<p>7/7/2012 1:00 PM</p>
<p>If you do not enter an end time, the report automatically ends at 12:00 AM on the specified day. To view data by day, enter just the date:</p>

<p>To view by week or by month, enter a date that falls anywhere within the week or month that you want to view (you do not have to enter the first day of the week or month):</p>

<li><p>Weekly (a maximum of 12 weeks can be displayed)</p></li>

</ul>
<p>If the start and end dates exceed the maximum number of values allowed for the selected interval, only the maximum number of values (starting from the start date) is displayed. For example, if you select the Daily interval with a start date of 7/7/2012 and an end date of 2/28/2012, data is displayed for the days 8/7/2012 12:00 AM to 9/7/2012 12:00 AM (that is, a total of 31 days' worth of data).</p></td>

<td><p>Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the Registrar pool or Edge Server. You can either select an individual pool or click <strong>[All]</strong> to view data for all the pools. This drop-down list is automatically populated for you based on the records in the database.</p></td>
