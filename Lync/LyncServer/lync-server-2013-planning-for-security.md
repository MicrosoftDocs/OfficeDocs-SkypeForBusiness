Use this security section to assess and manage security risks to your deployment of Lync Server 2013.

Even if your Lync Server 2013 deployment is modest, you probably have components in your network that have their own security documentation. Therefore, it is unlikely that this section covers all aspects of security for all components and areas that are pertinent to your deployment.

Use this section as a starting point to address the security of your Lync Server 2013 deployment. It provides general guidelines and best practices for assessing and managing the most common security risks. Additional product and security resources are listed at the end of each topic.

<div>


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Security is a constantly evolving topic. As new threats and solutions arise, outdated documents, solutions, methods, and procedures should be replaced with up-to-date material.
