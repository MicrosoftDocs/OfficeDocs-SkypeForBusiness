## Lync client updates

One of the most common checks that to do when troubleshooting Lync client issues is determining whether you are running the latest version of the Lync client and if all patches are installed. A majority of the Lync client issues that get reported are resolved by upgrading to the latest release or update of the product. Thus, we highly recommended that you install the latest version of the Lync client, along with the latest updates, before you contact Microsoft Product Support.
