To successfully complete this procedure you should be logged on as a user who is a member of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group or have the correct permissions delegated. For details about delegating permissions, see [Delegate setup permissions in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-delegate-setup-permissions.md). Depending on your organization and requirements for requesting certificates, you may require other group memberships. Consult with the group that manages your public key infrastructure (PKI) certification authority (CA).

<div>


> [!NOTE]  
> Lync Server 2013 includes support for the SHA-2 suite (SHA-2 uses digest lengths of 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits) of digest hash and signing algorithms for connections from clients running the Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, or Windows XP operating systems, in addition to Lync Phone Edition. To support external access using the SHA-2 suite, the external certificate is issued by a public CA that also can issue a certificate with the same bit length digest.



</div>

<div>


> [!WARNING]  
> The selection of which hash digest and signing algorithm is dependent on the clients and the servers that will use the certificate, and other computers and devices that clients and servers will communicate with who must also know how to use the algorithms used in the certificate. For information on which digest lengths are supported in the operating system and some client applications, see<A href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=287002">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=287002</A>.



</div>

Each Standard Edition server or Front End Server requires up to four certificates: the oAuthTokenIssuer certificate, a default certificate, a web internal certificate, and a web external certificate. However, it is possible to request and assign a single default certificate with appropriate subject alternative name entries as well as the oAuthTokenIssuer certificate. For details about the certificate requirements, see [Certificate requirements for internal servers in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-certificate-requirements-for-internal-servers.md). For details about requesting, assigning and installing the oAuthTokenIssuer certificate, see [Managing server-to-server authentication (OAuth) and partner applications in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-managing-server-to-server-authentication-oauth-and-partner-applications.md)

Use the following procedure to request, assign, and install the Standard Edition server or Front End Server certificates. Repeat the procedure for each Front End Server.

<div>


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The following procedure describes how to configure certificates from an internal enterprise PKI deployed by your organization and with offline request processing. For information about obtaining certificates from a public CA, see <A href="lync-server-2013-certificate-requirements-for-internal-servers.md">Certificate requirements for internal servers in Lync Server 2013</A> in the Planning documentation. Also, this procedure describes how to request, assign, and install certificates during set up of the Front End Server. If you requested certificates in advance, as described in the <A href="lync-server-2013-request-certificates-in-advance-optional.md">Request certificates in advance (optional) for Lync Server 2013</A> section of this Deployment documentation, or you do not use an internal enterprise PKI deployed in your organization to obtain certificates, you must modify this procedure as appropriate.



</div>

<div>

## To configure certificates for a Front End Server

1.  In the Lync Server Deployment Wizard, click **Run** next to **Step 3: Request, Install or Assign Certificates**.

2.  On the **Certificate Wizard** page, click **Request**.

3.  On the **Certificate Request** page, click **Next**.

4.  On the **Delayed or Immediate Requests** page, you can accept the default **Send the request immediately to an online certification authority** option by clicking **Next**. The internal CA with automatic online enrollment must be available if you select this option. If you choose the option to delay the request, you will be prompted for a name and location to save the certificate request file. The certificate request must be presented and processed by a CA either inside your organization, or by a public CA. You will then need to import the certificate response and assign it to the proper certificate role.

5.  On the **Choose a Certificate Authority (CA)** page, select the **Select a CA from the list detected in your environment** option, and then select a known (through registration in Active Directory Domain Services) CA from the list. Or, select the **Specify another certification authority** option, enter the name of another CA in the box, and then click **Next**.

6.  On the **Certificate Authority Account** page, you are prompted for credentials to request and process the certificate request at the CA. You should have determined if a user name and password is necessary to request a certificate in advance. Your CA administrator will have the required information and may have to assist you in this step. If you need to supply alternate credentials, select the check box, provide a user name and password in the text boxes, and then click **Next**.

7.  On the **Specify Alternate Certificate Template** page, to use the default Web Server template, click **Next**.
    
    <div>
    

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If your organization has created a template for use as an alternative for the default Web server CA template, select the check box, and then enter the name of the alternate template. You will need the template name as defined by the CA administrator.

    
    </div>

8.  On the **Name and Security Settings** page, specify a **Friendly Name** that should allow you to identify the certificate and purpose. If you leave it blank, a name will be generated automatically. Set the **Bit length** of the key, or accept the default of 2048 bits. Select the **Mark the certificate’s private key as exportable** if you determine that the certificate and private key needs to be moved or copied to other systems, and then click **Next**.
    
    <div>
    

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Lync Server 2013 has minimal requirements for an exportable private key. One such place is on the Edge Servers in a pool, where the Media Relay Authentication Service uses copies of the certificate, rather than individual certificates for each instance in the pool.

    
    </div>

9.  On the **Organization Information** page, optionally provide organization information, and then click **Next**.

10. On the **Geographical Information** page, optionally provide geographical information, and then click **Next**.

11. On the **Subject Name / Subject Alternate Names** page, review the subject alternative names that will be added, and then click **Next**.

12. On the **SIP Domain setting** page, select the **SIP Domain**, and then click **Next**.

13. On the **Configure Additional Subject Alternate Names** page, add any additional required subject alternative names, including any that might be required for additional SIP domains in the future, and then click **Next**.

14. On the **Certificate Request Summary** page, review the information in the summary. If the information is correct, click **Next**. If you need to correct or modify a setting, click **Back** to the proper page to make the correction or modification.

15. On the **Executing Commands** page, click **Next**.

16. On the **Online Certificate Request Status** page, review the information returned. You should note that the certificate was issued and installed into the local certificate store. If it is reported as having been issued and installed, but is not valid, make sure that the CA root certificate has been installed in the server’s Trusted Root CA store. Refer to your CA documentation on how to retrieve a Trusted Root CA certificate. If you need to view the retrieved certificate, click **View Certificate Details**. By default, the check box for **Assign the certificate to Lync Server certificate usages** is checked. If you want to manually assign the certificate, clear the check box, and then click **Finish**.

17. If you cleared the check box for **Assign the certificate to Lync Server certificate usages** on the previous page, you will be presented with the **Certificate Assignment** page. Click **Next**.

18. On the **Certificate Store** page, select the certificate that you requested. If you want to view the certificate, click **View Certificate Details**, and then click **Next** to continue.
    
    <div>
    

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If the <STRONG>Online Certificate Request Status</STRONG> page reported an issue with the certificate, such as the certificate not being valid, viewing the actual certificate can assist in resolving the issue. Two specific issues that can cause a certificate to not be valid is the previously mentioned missing Trusted Root CA certificate, and a missing private key that is associated with the certificate. Refer to your CA documentation to resolve these two issues.

    
    </div>

19. On the **Certificate Assignment Summary** page, review the information presented to make sure that this is the certificate that should be assigned, and then click **Next**.

20. On the **Executing Commands** page, review the output of the command. Click **View Log** if you want to review the assignment process or if there was an error or warning issued. When you are finished with your review, click **Finish**.

21. On the **Certificate Wizard** page, verify that the **Status** of the certificate is “Assigned,” and then click **Close**.
