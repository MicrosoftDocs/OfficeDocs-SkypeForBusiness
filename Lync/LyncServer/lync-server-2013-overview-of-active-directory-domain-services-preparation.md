To prepare Active Directory Domain Services for your Lync Server 2013 deployment, you must perform three steps in a specific sequence.

The following table describes the steps required to prepare AD DS for Lync Server.

### Active Directory Preparation Steps

In a resource forest topology, run this step only in the resource forest, not in any user forests. In a central forest topology, run this step only in the central forest, not in any user forests.

Lync Server 2013, like Lync Server 2010, stores much of the configuration information in the Central Management store instead of in AD DS as was the case in Office Communications Server 2007 R2. However, the following information is stored in AD DS:

  - **Schema extensions**:
    
      - User object extensions
    
      - Extensions for Office Communications Server 2007 R2 classes to maintain backward compatibility

<!-- end list -->

  - **Data** (stored in Lync Server extended schema and in existing schema classes):
    
      - User SIP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and other user settings
    
      - Contact objects for applications such as Response Group and Conferencing Attendant
    
      - A pointer to the Central Management store
    
      - Kerberos Authentication Account (an optional computer object)

In Lync Server 2013, you delegate setup and administration by granting setup permissions to the RTCUniversalServerAdmins universal group so that members of that group can install and activate Lync Server 2013 on a local server (after the server has been added to the topology, published, and enabled). The delegated users must be local administrators on the computer where they are installing and activating Lync Server 2013, but they do not need to be members of the Domain Admins group. You can also grant permissions for objects in specified organizational units (OUs) so that members of the universal groups created during forest preparation can access those objects without being members of the Domain Admins group.

For new deployments of Lync Server 2013, global settings must be stored in the Configuration container. If your organization is upgrading from an earlier version and you still have global settings in the System container, the System container is still supported.
