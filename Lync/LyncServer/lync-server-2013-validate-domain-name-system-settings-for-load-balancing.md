To support the FQDN used by DNS load balancing, you must provision DNS to resolve the pool FQDN (such as pool01.contoso.com) to the IP addresses of all the servers in the pool (for example, 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2, and so on). You should include only the IP addresses of servers that are currently deployed.

Additionally if you are using DNS load balancing for the Edge pools the following DNS entries are required:

  - For the Lync Server Access Edge service, you must have one entry for each server in the pool. Each entry must resolve the FQDN of the Lync Server Access Edge service (for example, sip.contoso.com) to the IP address of the Lync Server Access Edge service on one of the Edge Servers in the pool.

  - For the Lync Server Web Conferencing Edge service, you must have one entry for each server in the pool. Each entry must resolve the FQDN of the Lync Server Web Conferencing Edge service (for example, webconf.contoso.com) to the IP address of the Lync Server Web Conferencing Edge service on one of the Edge Servers in the pool.

  - For the Lync Server Audio/Video Edge service, you must have one entry for each server in the pool. Each entry must resolve the FQDN of the Lync Server Audio/Video Edge service (for example, av.contoso.com) to the IP address of the Lync Server Audio/Video Edge service on one of the Edge Servers in the pool.

  - If you want to use DNS load balancing on the internal interface of the Edge pool, you must add one DNS record, which resolves the internal FQDN of the Edge pool to the IP address of each server in the pool.

To verify that DNS is returning the correct values for DNS load balancing you should use the nslookup tool. To return all values for a DNS record with nslookup you should run the command:

`nslookup <FQDN >`

You would run this command for every FQDN used in DNS load balancing configuration to verify that every record set for DNS load balancing returned all of the correct entries.
