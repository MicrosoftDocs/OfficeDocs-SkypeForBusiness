The Lync Server Administrator Report is the first of four valuable reports that document your design in detail. The information in this report, and the other three associated reports, is excellent documentation for your Information Technology Teams:

![General Summary Admin Report](images/Gg558626.9c529ef7-cb1b-4ce1-a8bc-3ec79aba2377(OCS.15).jpg "General Summary Admin Report")

  - Certificates Report

  - Firewall Report

  - DNS Report

The Summary Report lists general configuration information associated with your Edge network. The location, fully qualified domain name (FQDN) and IP address, type of network, and comments specific to a given role are documented.

The designer and each of the teams that will deploy, manage, and maintain the infrastructure should review the summary report for accuracy and to make sure that errors are at a minimum.
