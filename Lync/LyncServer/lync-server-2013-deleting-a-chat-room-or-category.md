Persistent Chat rooms can be deleted. If you have a chat room that is no longer being used, you can disable it. For details, see [Disabling or enabling a chat room in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-disabling-or-enabling-a-chat-room.md).

A Persistent Chat administrator can query for disabled chat rooms, and can periodically purge and permanently delete the chat rooms, by using the Windows PowerShell cmdlet, **Remove-CsPersistentChatRoom**.

Categories can be deleted. However, to delete a category, you must first either delete all chat rooms under it or move the chat rooms to a new category, leaving an empty category for deletion. Persistent Chat Server does not allow you to delete a category that contains chat rooms. For details, see [Moving a chat room from one category to another in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-moving-a-chat-room-from-one-category-to-another.md).

For details about deleting empty categories by using the Windows PowerShell command-line interface, see "Room Management" in [Configuring Persistent Chat Server by using Windows PowerShell cmdlets](configuring-persistent-chat-server-by-using-windows-powershell-cmdlets.md).

For details about chat rooms and categories, see [Configure rooms in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-configure-rooms.md) and [Configure categories in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-configure-categories.md) in the Deployment documentation.
