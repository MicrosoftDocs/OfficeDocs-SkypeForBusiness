_**Topic Last Modified:** 2013-02-21_

In Lync Server 2013 Control Panel, you can use the **Add-in** section of the **Persistent Chat** page to associate URLs with Persistent Chat rooms. These URLs appear in the Lync 2013 client in the chat room in the conversation extensibility pane. An administrator must add Add-ins to the list of registered add-ins, and chat room managers/Creators have to associate rooms with one of the registered add-ins before users can see this upgrade in their Lync 2013 client.

Add-ins are used to extend the in-room experience. A typical add-in might include a URL pointing to a Silverlight application that intercepts when a stock ticker is posted to a chat room, and shows the stock history in the extensibility pane. Other examples include embedding a OneNote 2013 URL in the chat room as an add-in to include some shared context, such as "Top of mind" or "Topic of the day."

## To configure Add-ins for chat rooms

1.  From a user account that is assigned to the CsPersistentChatAdministrator or CsAdministrator role, log on to any computer in your internal deployment.

2.  From the **Start** menu, select the Lync Server Control Panel or open a browser window, and then enter the Admin URL. For details about the different methods that you can use to start Lync Server Control Panel, see [Open Lync Server 2013 administrative tools](lync-server-2013-open-lync-server-administrative-tools.md).

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > You can also use Windows PowerShell cmdlets. For details, see <A href="configuring-persistent-chat-server-by-using-windows-powershell-cmdlets.md">Configuring Persistent Chat Server by using Windows PowerShell cmdlets</A> in the Deployment documentation.

    
    </div>

3.  In the left navigation bar, click **Persistent Chat**, and then click **Add-in**.
    
    For multiple Persistent Chat Server pool deployments, select the appropriate pool from the drop-down list.

4.  On the **Add-in** page, click **New**.

5.  In **Select a Service**, select the service corresponding to the Persistent Chat Server pool where you need to create the Add-in. Add-ins cannot be moved from one pool to another or shared between different pools.

6.  In **New Add-in**, do the following:
    
      - In **Name**, specify a name for the new add-in.
    
      - In **URL**, specify the URL to be associated with the add-in. URLs are limited to http and https protocols.

7.  Click **Commit**.
