_**Topic Last Modified:** 2012-10-21_

The Peer-to-Peer Voice and Video Report provides a detailed look at the distribution of voice and video calls over a specified period of time (for example, calls per hour or calls per day). The report also gives you the option of viewing all the voice and video calls that were made, or of viewing only the successful or failed calls. The reports shows call information broken down into the following groupings:

  - Calls per pool

  - Calls per call type (for example, a Lync to Lync call vs. a Lync call to a person on the PSTN network)

  - Calls per access type (users logged on to the internal network vs. users logged on to the external network)

  - Calls per Mediation Server

  - Total peer-to-peer audio sessions

  - Total peer-to-peer audio minutes

  - Total peer-to-peer video sessions

  - Total peer-to-peer video minutes
