Lync Server 2013 provides basic session management through the support of intertrunk routing. This new capability enables Lync Server to provide call control functionalities to downstream telephony systems. With intertrunk routing, Lync Server can interconnect an IP-PBX to a public switched telephone network (PSTN) gateway so that calls from a private branch exchange (PBX) phone can be routed to the PSTN, and incoming PSTN calls can be routed to a PBX phone. Similarly, Lync Server can interconnect two or more IP-PBX systems so that calls can be placed and received between PBX phones from the different IP-PBX systems.
