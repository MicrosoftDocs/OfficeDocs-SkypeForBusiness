We recommend that you do not change the category of a Persistent Chat room after the chat room is created. However, if the chat room manager has **Creator** privileges in another category, he or she can move the room from one category to another. The room is not deleted and recreated. It is a change of association within the database.

Changing a chat room category should be done rarely. A category determines the allowed membership for the chat room, so when a chat room is moved to another category, all the system access control lists (SACLs) that are no longer supported by the new category are purged. For example, if a user was a member of the room and is no longer an **AllowedMember** in the new category, the room membership will be modified and the user will be removed from the room.

For details about moving a chat room by using the Windows PowerShell command-line interface, see "Room Management" in [Configuring Persistent Chat Server by using Windows PowerShell cmdlets](configuring-persistent-chat-server-by-using-windows-powershell-cmdlets.md).

For details about configuring chat rooms, see [Configure rooms in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-configure-rooms.md) in the Deployment documentation.
