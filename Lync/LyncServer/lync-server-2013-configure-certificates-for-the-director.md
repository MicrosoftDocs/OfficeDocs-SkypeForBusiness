> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When you run the Certificate Wizard, ensure that you are logged in using an account that is a member of a group that has been assigned the appropriate permissions for the type of certificate template you will use. By default, a Lync Server 2013 certificate request will use the Web Server certificate template. If you use an account that is a member of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group to request a certificate using this template, verify that the group has been assigned the Enroll permissions required to use that template.

Each Director requires a default certificate, a web internal certificate, and a web external certificate. For details about the certificate requirements for Directors, see [Certificate requirements for internal servers in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-certificate-requirements-for-internal-servers.md) in the Planning documentation.

Use the following procedure to configure Director certificates. Repeat the procedure for each Director. The steps of this procedure describe how to configure a certificate from an Internal Enterprise Root certification authority (CA) deployed by your organization and with offline request processing. For details about obtaining certificates from an external CA, contact your support team.
