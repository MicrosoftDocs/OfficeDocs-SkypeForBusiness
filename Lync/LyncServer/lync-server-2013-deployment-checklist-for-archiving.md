# Deployment checklist for Archiving in Lync Server 2013

Archiving is automatically installed on each Front End Server in your Lync Server 2013 deployment, but you still need to set it up before you can use it. The steps required to set it up, as summarized in this section, constitute the deployment of Archiving.

<div>

## Deployment Sequence

How you set up Archiving depends on which storage option you choose:

  - If you use Microsoft Exchange integration for all users in your deployment, you don’t need to configure Lync Server 2013 Archiving policies for your users. Instead, configure your Exchange In-Place Hold policies to support archiving for users homed on Exchange 2013, with their mailboxes put on In-Place Hold. For details about configuring these policies, see the Exchange 2013 product documentation.

  - If you do not use Microsoft Exchange integration for all users in your deployment, you need to add Lync Server Archiving databases (SQL Server databases) to your topology and then publish it, as well as configure policies and settings for your users, before you can archive data for those users. You can deploy Archiving databases at the same time that you deploy your initial topology or after you have deployed at least one Front End pool or Standard Edition server. This document describes how to deploy Archiving databases by adding them to an existing deployment.

If you enable archiving in one Front End pool or Standard Edition server, you should enable it for all other Front End pools and Standard Edition servers in your deployment. This is because users whose communications are required to be archived can be invited to a group IM conversation or meetings hosted on a different pool. If archiving is not enabled on the pool where the conversation or meeting is hosted, the complete session may not be archived. In these cases, IMs with archiving-enabled users still can be archived, but not for conferencing content files, and conference join or leave events.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If archiving is critical in your organization for compliance reasons, be sure to deploy Archiving, configure policies and other options at the appropriate level, and enable it for all appropriate users, before you enable those users for Lync Server 2013.

## Deploying Lync Server and Microsoft Exchange in Different Forests

If Microsoft Exchange Server is not deployed in the same forest as Lync Server, you must make sure that the following Exchange Active Directory attributes are synchronized to the forest where Lync Server is deployed:

1.  msExchUserHoldPolicies

2.  proxyAddresses

This is a multi-value attribute. When synchronizing this attribute, you need to merge the values, not replace them to ensure the existing values are not lost.
