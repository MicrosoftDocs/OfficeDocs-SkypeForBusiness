## Description

The Test-CsDialInConferencing cmdlet verifies whether a user can participate in a dial-in conference. Test-CsDialInConferencing works by trying to log a test user onto the system. If the logon succeeds, the cmdlet will then use the user’s credentials and permissions to try all of the available dial-in conferencing access numbers. The success or failure of each dial-in try will be noted, then the test user will be logged off from Lync Server.Test-CsDialInConferencing only verifies that the appropriate connections can be made. The cmdlet does not actually make any phone calls or create any dial-in conferences that other users can join.

## Running the test

The Test-CsDialInConferencing cmdlet can be run using either a preconfigured test account (see Setting Up Test Accounts for Running Lync Server Tests) or the account of any user who is enabled for Lync Server. To run this check using a test account, you just have to specify the FQDN of the Lync Server pool being tested. For example:

    Test-CsDialInConferencing -TargetFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" 

To run this check using an actual user account, you must create a Windows PowerShell credentials object that contains the account name and password. You must then include that credentials object and the account SIP address the calling Test-CsDialInConferencing:

    $credential = Get-Credential "litwareinc\kenmyer"
    Test-CsDialInConferencing -TargetFqdn atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -UserSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -UserCredential $credential

For more information, see the Help documentation for the [Test-CsDialInConferencing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/skype/Test-CsDialInConferencing) cmdlet.

## Determining success or failure

If the specified user can log on to Lync Server and then make a connection using one of the available dial-in conferencing access numbers, then you'll receive output similar to this, with the Result property marked as **Success:**

TargetFqdn : atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com

Result : Success

Latency : 00:00:06.8630376

Error :

Diagnosis :

If the specified user can't make this connection, then the Result will be shown as Failure, and additional information will be recorded in the Error and Diagnosis properties:

TargetFqdn : atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com

Result : Failure

Latency : 00:00:00

Error : The log on was denied. Check that the proper credentials are

being used and the account is active.

Inner Exception:NegotiateSecurityAssociation failed, error: -

2146893044

Diagnosis :

The previous output indicates that the test user was denied access to Lync Server itself. This typically means that the user credentials passed to Test-CsDialInConferencing were not valid. In turn, you should re-create the Windows PowerShell credentials object. Although you can retrieve the password for the user account, you can verify the SIP address by using a command similar to this:

    Get-CsUser -Identity "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" | Select-Object SipAddress

</div>

## Reasons why the test might have failed

Here are some common reasons why Test-CsDialInConferencing might fail:

  - You specified a user account that is not valid. You can verify that a user account exists by running a command similar to this:
    
        Get-CsUser "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com"

  - The user account is valid, but the account is currently not enabled for Lync Server. To verify that a user account is enabled for Lync Server, run a command similar to the following:
    
        Get-CsUser "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" | Select-Object Enabled
    
    If the Enabled property is set to False, that means that the user is currently not enabled for Lync Server.

  - You might have an incorrect dial-in conferencing access number. You can return your currently-configured list of dial-in conferencing access numbers by using this command:
    
        Get-CsDialConferencingAccessNumber
