Network sites are the offices or locations configured within each region of a call admission control (CAC) or Enhanced 9-1-1 deployment. You can use the Lync Server 2013 Control Panel to configure sites and associate them with regions. For example, a network region for North America might be associated with networks sites such as Chicago, Redmond, and Vancouver. A CAC network site must be created for every site within an organization, even if that site has no bandwidth limitations. From the Lync Server Control Panel you can create, modify, and delete network sites. Use the following procedure to delete an existing network site. For details about creating or modifying network sites, see [Creating or modifying network sites in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-creating-or-modifying-network-sites.md)

## To delete a network site

1.  From a user account that is a member of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group (or has equivalent user rights), or is assigned to the CsAdministrator role, log on to any computer in your internal deployment.

2.  Open a browser window, and then enter the Admin URL to open the Lync Server Control Panel. For details about the different methods you can use to start Lync Server Control Panel, see [Open Lync Server 2013 administrative tools](lync-server-2013-open-lync-server-administrative-tools.md).

3.  In the left navigation bar, click **Network Configuration** and then click **Site**.

4.  On the **Site** page, click the site that you want to delete.
