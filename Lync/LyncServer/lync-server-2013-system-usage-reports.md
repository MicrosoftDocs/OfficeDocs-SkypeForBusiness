## In This Section

  - [User Registration Report in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-user-registration-report.md)
    
    Provides a summary of user connectivity to the Lync Server 2013 deployment based on registration events such as user logons. The report provides a way to view both internal and external logons, and to compare the number of users who logged on to Lync Server 2013 with the number of users who actually used the service while they were logged on.

  - [Peer-to-Peer Activity Summary Report in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-peer-to-peer-activity-summary-report.md)
    
    Provides a summary of peer-to-peer instant messaging (IM), audio, video, file transfer, and application sharing sessions. Peer-to-peer sessions are sessions involving just two users.

  - [Conference Summary Report in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-conference-summary-report.md)
    
    Provides a summary of all conference activities. Conferences are sessions involving three or more people.

  - [PSTN Conference Summary Report in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-pstn-conference-summary-report.md)
    
    Provides a summary of all PSTN conferences. These are conferences where at least one user dials in using the public switched telephone network (PSTN), which is also referred to as *dial-in conferencing*.

  - [Response Group Usage Report in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-response-group-usage-report.md)
    
    Provides a summary of Response Group usage. The Response Group application provides a way for you to automatically route phone calls to entities such as a help desk or customer support line.

  - [IP Phone Inventory Report in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-ip-phone-inventory-report.md)
    
    Provides information about the IP phones currently in use in the organization. The report is based on phone registrations and logons. It should not be considered a complete inventory. For example, you might have removed phones that are still listed in the report because they logged on at least once. Likewise, you might also have new phones that do not show up in the report simply because users have not logged on to Lync Server with their new phones yet.

  - [Call Admission Control Report in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-call-admission-control-report.md)
    
    Provides a list of peer-to-peer and conference activities that use call admission control. Call admission control (CAC) is a way of determining whether you should allow real-time communications sessions, such as voice or video calls, based on bandwidth constraints.
