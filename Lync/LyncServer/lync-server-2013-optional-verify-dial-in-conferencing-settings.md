As final verification of your dial-in conferencing configuration, you can search for dial plans that have a dial-in conferencing region that is not used by any access number and for access numbers that have not specified a dial-in conferencing region. This step is optional.

<div>

## To find dial plans with a dial-in conferencing region that is not used by an access number

1.  Log on to the computer as a member of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group, or as a member of the **Cs-ServerAdministrator** or **CsAdministrator** role.

2.  Start the Lync Server Management Shell: Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft Lync Server 2013**, and then click **Lync Server Management Shell**.

3.  Run the following at the command prompt:
    
        Get-CsDialinConferencingAccessNumber -EmptyRegion
    
    This cmdlet returns all of the dial plans that have a dial-in conferencing region that is not used by an access number.

</div>

<div>

## To find access numbers without assigned regions

1.  Log on to the computer as a member of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group, or as a member of the **Cs-ServerAdministrator** or **CsAdministrator** role.

2.  Start the Lync Server Management Shell: Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft Lync Server 2013**, and then click **Lync Server Management Shell**.

3.  Run the following at the command prompt:
    
        Get-CsDialinConferencingAccessNumber -Region NULL
    
    This cmdlet returns all the dial-in conferencing access numbers that are not associated with a region.
