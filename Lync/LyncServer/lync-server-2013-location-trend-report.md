The Location Trend Report provides call quality trend information for network locations.

<div>

## Filters

Filters provide a way for you to return a more finely-targeted set of data or to view the returned data in different ways. For example, the Location Trend Report enables you to filter the returned data by such things as access type (that is, interval access vs. external access) or by wired/wireless network connection. You can also choose how data should be grouped. In this case, calls are grouped by hour, day, or week.

The following table lists the filters that you can use with the Location Trend Report.
