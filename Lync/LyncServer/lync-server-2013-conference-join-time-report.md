The Conference Join Time Summary enables you to determine how long it takes your users to join a conference. The report shows the average join time (in milliseconds), and also provides a breakdown that lets you know how many users were able to join a conference in 2 seconds or less, how many users required between 2 and 5 seconds to join the conference, and so on.
