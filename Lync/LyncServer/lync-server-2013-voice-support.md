If your deployment includes a Front End pool, you can deploy support for Enterprise Voice, the Voice over IP (VoIP) solution offered by Microsoft. Voice over IP (VoIP) is a software-based alternative to traditional PBX-based telephony. Although the VoIP call experience is similar to the traditional telephony experience, Enterprise Voice includes features that enable richer communication and collaboration. For example, your Enterprise Voice deployment can be configured to make it possible for Lync 2013 and Lync Phone Edition users to view enhanced presence information or location information for contacts in your organization’s address book. Some Lync Server 2013 features are enabled through integration with other Lync Server 2013 workloads and with Exchange Unified Messaging (UM). For details about the features and functionality available with Enterprise Voice and how to plan for deployment, see [Planning for Enterprise Voice in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-planning-for-enterprise-voice.md) in the Planning documentation.
