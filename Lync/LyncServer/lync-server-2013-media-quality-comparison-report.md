The Media Quality Comparison Report enables you to compare call quality values for different types of audio calls (for example, calls made over a wireless network vs. calls made across a wired connection).

<div>

## Accessing the Media Quality Comparison Report

The Media Quality Comparison Report is accessed from the Monitoring Reports home page.

<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Name</th>
<th>Can you sort on this item?</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Call volume</strong></p></td>
<td><p>No</p></td>
<td><p>Total number of calls.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Degradation (MOS)</strong></p></td>
<td><p>No</p></td>
<td><p>Average amount of MOS (mean opinion score) degradation experienced during a call. Degradation values can range from a low of 0.0 to a high of 5.0; a value of 0.5 or less represents acceptable degradation. Historically, mean opinion scores were calculated by having users rate the quality of a call on a scale of 1-to-5. Lync Server uses a set of algorithms to predict how users would have rated a call.</p>
<p>High degradation values can be caused by congestion; lack of bandwidth; wireless congestion or interference, or an overloaded media server or endpoint. High degradation results in distorted or lost audio.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Poor call percentage</strong></p></td>
<td><p>No</p></td>
<td><p>The total number of calls classified as poor. A poor call is any call which at least one of the measured metrics exceeded the allowed value (for example, a call that experienced excessive jitter).</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Round trip (ms)</strong></p></td>
<td><p>No</p></td>
<td><p>Average amount of (in milliseconds) required for a Real-Time Transport Protocol packet to travel to another endpoint and then back. Round-trip times of 200 milliseconds or less are considered of acceptable quality.</p>
<p>High round-trip values can be caused by international call routing; a routing misconfiguration; or an overloaded media server. High round-trip times result in difficulties with two-way, real-time audio conversations.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Packet loss</strong></p></td>
<td><p>No</p></td>
<td><p>Average rate of Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) packet loss. (Packet loss occurs when RTP packets, a protocol used for transmitting audio and video across the Internet, failed to reach their destination.) High loss rates are generally caused by congestion; lack of bandwidth; wireless congestion or interference; or an overloaded media server. Packet loss typically results in distorted or lost audio.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Jitter (ms)</strong></p></td>
<td><p>No</p></td>
<td><p>Average jitter detected between RTP packet arrivals. (Jitter is a measure of the &quot;shakiness&quot; of a call.) High jitter values are typically caused by congestion or an overloaded media server, and result in distorted or lost audio.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Healer concealed ratio</strong></p></td>
<td><p>No</p></td>
<td><p>Average ratio of concealed audio samples to the total to the total number of samples. (A concealed audio sample is a technique used to smooth out the abrupt transition that would usually be caused by dropped network packets.) High values indicate significant levels of loss concealment applied caused by packet loss or jitter, and results in distorted or lost audio.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Healer stretched ratio</strong></p></td>
<td><p>No</p></td>
<td><p>Average ratio of stretched audio samples to the total to the total number of samples. (Stretched audio is audio that has been expanded to help maintain call quality when a dropped network packet has been detected.) High values indicate significant levels of sample stretching caused by jitter, and result in audio sounding robotic or distorted.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Healer compressed ratio</strong></p></td>
<td><p>No</p></td>
<td><p>Average ratio of compressed audio samples to the total number of samples. (Compressed audio is audio that has been compressed to help maintain call quality when a dropped network packet has been detected.) High values indicate significant levels of sample compression caused by jitter, and result in audio sounding accelerated or distorted.</p></td>
