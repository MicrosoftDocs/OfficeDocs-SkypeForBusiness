You can use Lync Server 2013 Control Panel to view a list of the trusted applications that you have deployed in your Lync Server 2013 environment. A trusted application is an application based on Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API (UCMA) 3.0 Core SDK that is trusted by Lync Server 2013. This trust relationship is summarized in the following list:

  - Trusted applications are not challenged for authentication by Lync Server.

  - Trusted applications are not throttled by Lync Server for SIP transactions, connections or outgoing Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calls.

  - Trusted applications can impersonate any user and can join conferences without appearing in rosters.

  - Trusted applications are highly available and resilient.

In Lync Server Control Panel, you can see the name of the applications, the pool where they run, and the port they use.
