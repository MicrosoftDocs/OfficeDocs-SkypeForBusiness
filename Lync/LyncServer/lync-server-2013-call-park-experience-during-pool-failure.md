When a Front End pool becomes unavailable due an unplanned incident, calls that have been parked but not yet retrieved are disconnected. During failover to a backup pool, users are redirected to the backup pool and are in resiliency mode. While in resiliency mode, users cannot park calls, but they can place calls on hold and transfer them. When failover is complete, calls can again be parked and retrieved as usual. During failback, users cannot park calls until they are out of resiliency mode.

During disaster recovery, users who have been redirected to the backup pool as part of the failover process use the Call Park application that is deployed in the backup pool. Therefore, users who are redirected to the backup pool use the call park settings that are configured for the Call Park application in the backup pool.

The following table summarizes the Call Park experience through the phases of disaster recovery.
