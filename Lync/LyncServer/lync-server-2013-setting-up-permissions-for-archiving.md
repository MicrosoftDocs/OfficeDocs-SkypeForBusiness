In Lync Server 2013, specific tasks still require that users who perform those tasks be members of one or more specific groups. However, you can also use role-based access control (RBAC) to grant privileges by assigning users to predefined Lync Server administrative roles.Before you deploy Archiving, be sure that the appropriate user rights and permissions are in place, and that any users who you want to assign to a specific RBAC role have been assigned to that role. For details about the user rights, permissions, and roles for deploying support for Archiving, see [Deployment checklist for Archiving in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-deployment-checklist-for-archiving.md), which is available in the Planning documentation and the Deployment documentation. For details about RBAC, see [Planning for role-based access control in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-planning-for-role-based-access-control.md) in the Planning documentation.
