The procedures in this section describe how to back up Lync Server so that you can recover service in the event of an outage or failure.

You should develop a backup and recovery strategy and plan for your organization, as described in [Developing a backup and restoration strategy and plan for Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-developing-a-backup-and-restoration-strategy-and-plan.md). This strategy and plan should include the specific procedures that you plan to use. Use the procedures included in the topics in this section, along with the worksheets in [Backup and restoration worksheets for Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-backup-and-restoration-worksheets.md), to document how you plan to back up your specific Lync Server deployment.
