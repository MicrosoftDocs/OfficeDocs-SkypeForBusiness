The user models described here provide the basis for the capacity planning measurements and recommendations described in [Capacity planning for Lync Server 2013 using the user models](lync-server-2013-capacity-planning-using-the-user-models.md).

## Lync Server 2013 User Models

The following table describes the user model for registration, contacts, instant messaging (IM), and presence for Lync Server 2013.

### Environment and Registration User Model

<tr class="even">
<td><p>Percentage of Active Directory users</p></td>
<td><p>We assume that 70% of all Active Directory users in the organization are enabled for Lync Server. 80% of those enabled users are logged on to Lync Server each day (80% concurrency). The concurrent users are the basis for the numbers in the rest of this section.</p></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Active Directory changes</p></td>
<td><p>We assume that 0.5% of total users are created and enabled for Lync in Active Directory each week, and that 0.5% of total users are disabled from Active Directory and from Lync each week. 5% of users have at least one Active Directory attribute changed each week.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Active Directory distribution groups</p></td>

<li><p>13% have 31-50 users</p></li>

<p>If mobility is enabled, we assume that 40% of users are using mobility concurrently with the other previously cited registered client options. In this case the client multiple point of presence (MPOP) ratio is 1:1.9. If mobility is disabled, the MPOP ratio is 1:1.5.</p></td>

Customers with active licenses will be able to continue to federate with Yahoo! Messenger until the service shut down date. An end of life date of June 2014 for AOL and Yahoo! has been announced.

> <P>The PIC USL is a per-user per-month subscription license that is required for Lync Server or Office Communications Server to federate with Yahoo! Messenger. Microsoft’s ability to provide this service has been contingent upon support from Yahoo!, the underlying agreement for which is winding down.</P>

Federation with Windows Live Messenger requires no additional user/device licenses beyond the Lync Standard CAL.

<li><p>Six user searches per hour. Every time a search is performed, a batch poll is sent for everyone in the search result list. We assume the average size of search results is 20. If the search results stay on screen, the batch poll is refreshed every 5 minutes; we assume that there will be two such refreshes per hour.</p></li>

<p>For each client, a single batch subscription request is sent to obtain the presence state of an average of 40 contacts, with an additional 40 dialogs to obtain presence for federated contacts.</p>
<p>Presence for members of an expanded distribution group is found through persistent presence subscriptions, not polling, and is modeled as 1 expansion per user for each 2 hours.</p>
<p><em>Short subscriptions</em> happen when a user logs in, there is a batch subscription for all the user’s contacts, and then the user soon logs off. We assume 6 short subscriptions per user per hour, where each subscription lasts 10 minutes.</p></td>

In regular Front End pools, Lync Server 2013 has a maximum supported meeting size of 250 users. Each pool can host one 250-user meeting at a time. While this large meeting is occurring, the pool can also host other smaller conferences. Additionally, you can support meetings of up to 1000 users by setting up a dedicated pool to host these meetings. For details, see [Support for large meetings in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-support-for-large-meetings.md).

Conferences were simulated as follows:

  - 85% of conferences had four participants.

  - 10% of conferences had six participants.

  - 5% of conferences had 11 participants.

  - One large conference of 250 users.

The following table provides details about the user model for conferences involving dial-in users.

<div>

## Busy Hour

For peer-to-peer sessions, peak load is calculated using busy hour call attempts (BHCA). This voice industry term assumes that 50% of all calls for the day will be completed in 20% of the time. It is calculated using the following formula:

`BHCA=(total calls * 0.5) / 1.6`

Performance testing simulated busy hour by running VoIP and other peer-to-peer sessions at a busy hour load for at least 1.6 hours per day.

Conferencing peak load assumes that 75% of all conferences for an eight-hour day happen in 4 peak time hours. Those peak hours have 1.5 times the average conferencing load.

</div>

<div>

## Enterprise Voice to PSTN Calls

The following assumptions apply to Enterprise Voice calls:

  - 50% of users are enabled for Enterprise Voice, and 60% of these users are enabled for PSTN calling.

  - Each of these users enabled for PSTN calling makes 4 PSTN calls during the busy hour. Each call duration is 3 minutes.

  - 65% of these PSTN voice calls use media bypass.

</div>

<div>

## Mobility

40% of registered users are assumed to be enabled for Mobility. For each user that has mobility enabled, we assume that the activity of the mobile client is additive to that of the other MPOP instances for that user, with the exception of conferencing interactions, for which the mobility client is just another client type that can be used to participate in conferences.

</div>

<div>

## Persistent Chat

We assume that 25% of registered users will be involved in Persistent chat sessions, with the following characteristics:

  - An average of 1.5 chat rooms per user

  - Each chat room results in 12 polling requests per hour, targeting an average of 10 users each

</div>

<div>

## Response Group and Call Park

We assume that 0.15% of registered users belong to response groups. We assume that 0.02% of registered users have parked calls at any given point of time.
