Each record contains a client event for one endpoint in an audio call. Usually, one call has two records, one for caller and one for callee.

<td><p>decimal(5,2)</p></td>
<td><p> </p></td>
<td><p>Percentage of session the DeviceLowSNR event was fired for ‘Bad’ state. The capture quality is very poor, either very noisy or user is talking too far away from the microphone. This will cause distortions.</p></td>

<td><p>decimal(5,2)</p></td>
<td><p> </p></td>
<td><p>Percentage of session the DeviceLowSpeechLevel event was fired for ‘Bad’ state. User‘s speech level is too low and the system cannot increase it any further. This can either cause distortions or perceived as one-way audio.</p></td>

<td><p>Decimal(5,2)</p></td>
<td><p> </p></td>
<td><p>Percentage of session the DeviceClipping event was fired for ‘Bad’ state.</p>
<p>When near-end speech clips the microphone, far-end hears distortion due to clipping. It is important to avoid near-end microphone clipping.</p></td>

<td><p><strong>DeviceEchoEventRatio</strong></p></td>
<td><p>decimal(5,2)</p></td>

<td><p>decimal(5,2)</p></td>
<td><p> </p></td>
<td><p>Percentage of session the DeviceNearEndToEchoRatio event was fired for ‘Bad’ state. The user’s speech is too low compared to the echo being captured which impacts the users experience because it limits how easy it is to interrupt a user. Reduce speaker volume, move the microphone closer to the talker.</p></td>
