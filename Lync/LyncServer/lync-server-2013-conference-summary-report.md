The Conference Summary Report provides an overall view of your online conferencing sessions. A conference typically involves more than 2 users and requires the use of Microsoft Lync Server 2013 conferencing services. By comparison, a peer-to-peer session typically involves just 2 users and does not require the use of Lync Server's conferencing services. Peer-to-peer activities are reported on the [Peer-to-Peer Activity Summary Report in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-peer-to-peer-activity-summary-report.md).

The Conference Summary Report not only tells you how many conferences were held during a given time period (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) but also tells you the total number of people who took part in those conferences, and the total number of unique conference organizers.

A "unique” organizer is anyone who schedules at least one conference. For example, if Pilar Ackerman schedules one conference she counts as one unique organizer. If Ken Myer schedules 148 conferences he, too counts as one unique organizer. For example, the table below shows 8 conferences scheduled, but just three unique organizers (Ken Myer, Pilar Ackerman, and David Ahs).

The Conference Summary Report also indicates how many conferences included audio and/or video.

## Accessing the Conference Summary Report

The Conference Summary Report is accessed from the Monitoring Reports home page. You can drill down to the Conference Activity report by clicking either of the following metrics:

  - Total conferences

  - Total participants

## Making the Best Use of the Conference Summary Report

Total values for most of the metrics used on the Conference Summary Report can be found at the bottom of the report; scroll down to see values such as the total number of conferences held during the specified time period, and the total number of people who participated in those conferences. One metric that is not totaled at the bottom of the report is Total unique conference organizers. Why not? Here’s one reason. Suppose you are looking at a month's worth of data. On day 1 you had 34 unique conference organizers; on day 2 you had 27 unique conference organizers. Does that mean you had 61 unique conference organizers for those two days? Not necessarily. After all, all 27 people who organized conferences on day 2 might be among the 34 people who organized conferences on day 1. For example, in this simple report, note that Ken Myer and Pilar Ackerman scheduled conferences both on 7/7/2012 and on 7/2/2012:

To get a better idea of the total number of unique users who organized conferences, change your time interval; for example, look at the data by month instead of by day.

## Filters

Filters provide a way for you to return a more finely-targeted set of data or to view the returned data in different ways. For example, the Conference Summary Report enables you to choose how data should be grouped. In this case, conferences grouped by hour, day, week, or month.

The following table lists the filters that you can use with the Conference Summary Report.
