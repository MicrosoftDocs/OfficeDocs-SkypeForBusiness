A client version policy is made up of a set of client version policy rules. These rules define the actions that should be taken when users attempt to log on with specific clients and client versions. You can delete individual rules from a client version policy from Lync Server 2013 Control Panel.

<div>

## To delete client version policy rules with Lync Server Control Panel

1.  From a user account that is assigned to the CsUserAdministrator role or the CsAdministrator role, log on to any computer in your internal deployment.

2.  Open a browser window, and then enter the Admin URL to open the Lync Server Control Panel. For details about the different methods you can use to start Lync Server Control Panel, see [Open Lync Server 2013 administrative tools](lync-server-2013-open-lync-server-administrative-tools.md).

3.  In the left navigation bar, click **Clients**, and then click the **Client Version Policy** navigation button.

4.  On the **Client Version Policy** page, double-click the client version policy for the rule you want to delete.

5.  The rules appear on the **Edit Client Version Policy** page. To delete a rule, select the rule, and then click **Remove**.
