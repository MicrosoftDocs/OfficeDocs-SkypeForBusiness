When you use Best Practices Analyzer to scan your environment, you specify a name for the scan. After Best Practices Analyzer completes a scan, it stores the scan results in reports and saves them under the name of the scan. Upon completion of the scan, you can view the reports generated for that scan by clicking **View a report of this Best Practices scan** directly from the **Scanning Completed** page. You can also view the reports from that scan or previous scans at a later time. You can view reports on the local computer on which the scan was run, import scan results from another computer, or export scan results to view the reports on another computer on which Best Practices Analyzer is installed.

Scan results are presented in the following types of reports:

  - List reports

  - Tree reports

  - Other reports

These reports include errors, warnings, and other information. For details about each of these types of reports and issues, see [Understanding reports created by Best Practices Analyzer in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-understanding-reports-created-by-best-practices-analyzer.md).

Use the following procedure to view scan results previously generated by Best Practices Analyzer.
