Enterprise Voice call management features control how incoming calls are routed and answered. Lync Server 2013 provides the following call management features:

  - **Call Park:** Enables voice users to temporarily park a call and then pick it up from the same phone or another phone.

  - **Group Pickup:** Enables users to answer calls made to another user who is assigned to a pickup group by dialing the call pickup group number.

  - **Response Group:** Routes incoming calls to groups of agents by using hunt groups or interactive voice response (IVR) questions and answers.

  - **Announcement:** Plays a message for calls made to an unassigned number, or routes the call elsewhere, or both.

This section describes how to configure these call management features during an Enterprise Voice deployment.
