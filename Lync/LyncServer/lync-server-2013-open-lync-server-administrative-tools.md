    <div>
    

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You can define a topology by using an account that is a member of the local Users group, but to read, publish, or enable a topology, which is required to install Lync Server 2013 on a server, you must use an account that is a member of the Domain Admins group and the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group, and that has full control permissions (that is, read, write, and modify) on the file share that you are going to use for the archiving file store so that Topology Builder can configure the required discretionary access control list (DACLs), or an account with equivalent user rights.
