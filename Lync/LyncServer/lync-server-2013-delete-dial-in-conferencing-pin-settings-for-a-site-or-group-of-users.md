## To delete a user or site PIN policy

1.  From a user account that is a member of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group (or has equivalent user rights), or assigned to the CsServerAdministrator or CsAdministrator role, log on to any computer that is in the network in which you deployed Lync Server 2013.

2.  Open a browser window, and then enter the Admin URL to open the Lync Server Control Panel. For details about the different methods you can use to start Lync Server Control Panel, see [Open Lync Server 2013 administrative tools](lync-server-2013-open-lync-server-administrative-tools.md).

3.  In the left navigation bar, click **Conferencing**, and then click **PIN Policy**.

4.  On the **PIN Policy** page, in the search field, type all or part of the name of the policy you want to delete.

5.  In the list of policies, click the policy that you want, click **Edit**, and then click **Delete**.

6.  Click **OK**.
