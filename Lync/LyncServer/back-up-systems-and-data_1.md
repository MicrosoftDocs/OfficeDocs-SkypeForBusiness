Before you begin the migration to Lync Server 2013, we strongly recommend that you perform a full system backup and document your existing system, including an inventory of user accounts that are homed on each pool, so that you can roll back to Office Communications Server 2007 R2 if it becomes necessary. Multiple tools and programs are available for backing up and restoring data, settings, and systems. For details and procedures, see "Office Communications Server 2007 R2 Backup and Restoration Guide" at <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=168162>.
