The Lync PreCall Diagnostics Tool (PCD) is a client-based application that allows you to see how the current state of your network might impact the audio quality in an upcoming Enterprise Voice call.

PCD is most useful in situations where the last hop of a network is likely to be the weakest (for example, with laptops on a public WiFi network or home users). PCD creates a small packet stream that traverses this final leg of the network. The tool then analyzes the packet stream to estimate how the jitter and loss along this leg might impact call quality, and then provides a report. You can run PCD continuously on the client, even while calls are being placed. The packet stream does not have a significant effect on bandwidth.

**The latest release of the PCD, version 1.1, includes the following enhancements:**

  - Support for longer passwords, which can now be up to 127 characters

  - Additional diagnostics for authentication sign-in issues

  - Better support for Lync hybrid deployments

  - Updates to credential picker

  - Stability improvements

We appreciate any feedback. Please send all support questions or issues to the [PCD Feedback](mailto:pcdfb@microsoft.com) alias at <pcdfb@microsoft.com>.
