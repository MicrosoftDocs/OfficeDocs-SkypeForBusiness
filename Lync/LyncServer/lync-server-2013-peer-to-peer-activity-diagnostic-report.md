# Peer-to-Peer Activity Diagnostic Report in Lync Server 2013

_**Topic Last Modified:** 2012-10-01_

The Peer-to-Peer Activity Diagnostic Report provides information about the success and failure of your peer-to-peer communication sessions. Note that Microsoft Lync Server 2013 distinguishes between different kinds of failure:

  - **Expected failure**. An expected failure is typically a failure only in the most technical sense. For example, suppose you call someone, but he or she is away from the office and is unable to answer the phone. Because the call was not answered, the call is technically considered a failure. On the other hand, this was an expected failure: Microsoft Lync Server 2013 does not expect you to answer the phone if you're not available to answer the phone. Likewise, an expected failure will occur if you attempt to send an instant message to a user who is offline, or is logged on only to a phone that does not support instant messaging.

  - **Unexpected failure**. An unexpected error is exactly what the name implies: an error that, based on the circumstances, you would not expect to occur. For example, suppose you call someone and that person is available to answer the call; however, when Lync Server 2013 tries to route your call to voicemail the call fails because connectivity to Exchange Unified Messaging has been lost. That's an unexpected error: you would expect that calls could always be routed to voicemail. As a general rule, unexpected failures are true failures: they are problems that likely cannot be remedied through user education or similar measures.

Note that the Success, Expected failure, and Unexpected failure metrics might not add up to the Total sessions metric. For example, in the preceding illustration, we have the following values:


<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Successes</th>
<th>Expected failures</th>
<th>Unexpected failures</th>
<th>Total sessions</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>2024</p></td>
<td><p>469</p></td>
<td><p>16</p></td>
<td><p>2521</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


If you add 2024 + 469 + 16 you get a total of 2,509 sessions, yet the Total sessions column shows a total of 2,521 sessions. The "missing" 12 sessions are sessions that the system was unable to categorize as successful or unsuccessful. That will sometimes be the case when a third-party product introduces a new diagnostic code that is unfamiliar to Lync Server. When that happens, calls made using that product, and reporting that diagnostic code, cannot always be categorized as being a Success, an Expected failure, or an Unexpected failure.

## Accessing the Peer-to-Peer Activity Diagnostic Report

The Peer-to-Peer Diagnostic Report is accessed from the Monitoring Reports home page. You can access the [Failure Distribution Report in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-failure-distribution-report.md) by clicking either of the following metrics:

  - Unexpected failure volume

  - Expected failure volume

## Making the Best Use of the Peer-to-Peer Activity Diagnostic Report

There are a number of ways you can filter the Peer-to-Peer Activity Diagnostic Report but, by default, those filtering options are hidden from view. To view the filtering options available to you, click the Show/Hide Parameters button in the upper right-hand corner of the report window. Once you do that the filtering options will be available for use.

## Filters

Filters provide a way for you to return a more finely-targeted set of data or to view the returned data in different ways. For example, the Peer-to-Peer Activity Diagnostic Report enables you to filter on such things as the session modality (for example, instant messaging, file transfer, or application sharing). You can also choose how data should be grouped. In this case, calls are grouped by hour, day, week, or month.

The following table lists the filters that you can use with the Peer-to-Peer Activity Diagnostic Report.

<p>7/7/2012 1:00 PM</p>
<p>If you do not enter a start time, the report automatically begins at 12:00 AM on the specified day. To view data by day, enter just the date:</p>
<p>7/7/2012</p>
<p>To view by week or by month, enter a date that falls anywhere within the week or month that you want to view (you do not have to enter the first day of the week or month):</p>
<p>7/3/2012</p>
<p>Weeks always run from Sunday through Saturday.</p></td>

<tr class="even">

<p>If the start and end dates exceed the maximum number of values allowed for the selected interval, only the maximum number of values (starting from the start date) is displayed. For example, if you select the Daily interval with a start date of 7/7/2012 and an end date of 2/28/2012, data is displayed for the days 8/7/2012 12:00 AM to 9/7/2012 12:00 AM (that is, a total of 31 days' worth of data).</p></td>

<td><p>Total number of sessions where an &quot;expected failure&quot; occurred.</p>
<p>An expected failure is a failure that is expected to happen. For example, if a user has set his or her status to Do Not Disturb you would expect any call to that user to fail.</p></td>

<tr class="even">

<td><p>No</p></td>
<td><p>Total number of sessions where an &quot;unexpected failure&quot; occurred.</p>
<p>An unexpected failure is a failure that occurs in what would appear to be an otherwise healthy system. For example, a call should not be terminated if the caller is placed on hold. If that occurs, that would be flagged as an unexpected failure.</p></td>
