When you run Lync Server 2013, Best Practices Analyzer in your Lync Server 2013 environment, the tool uses the scan results to generate reports of issues with your deployment. You can use the reports generated by Best Practices Analyzer to identify and resolve specific issues.

<div>


> [!NOTE]  
> Lync Server 2013, Best Practices Analyzer scans and reports issues only with Lync Server 2013 components. If your deployment includes Microsoft Lync Server 2010 or Office Communications Server 2007 R2 components, use the previous version of Best Practices Analyzer to analyze those components.
