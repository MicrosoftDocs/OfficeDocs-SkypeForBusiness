_**Topic Last Modified:** 2012-11-01_

The Centralized Logging Service is controlled and configured by settings and parameters that are created and used by the Centralized Logging Service Controller (CLSController) to send commands to the individual computer’s Centralized Logging Service Agent (CLSAgent). The agent processes the commands that are sent to it and (in the case of a Start command) uses the configuration of the scenarios, providers, log size, trace duration, and flags to begin collecting trace logs according to the configuration information provided.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Not all Windows PowerShell cmdlets listed for the Centralized Logging Service are intended for use with Lync Server 2013 on-premises deployments. Although they may appear to work, the following cmdlets are not designed to function with Lync Server 2013 on-premises deployments:

This is not to say that there is no use for these cmdlets in on-premises deployments, but their use is a more advanced topic that is not covered in this documentation.
