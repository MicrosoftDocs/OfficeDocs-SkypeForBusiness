As with deployment of your other Lync Server 2013 components, deployment of web conferencing requires that you use Topology Builder to create and publish a topology that incorporates conferencing.

<div>

## Deployment Sequence

You can deploy conferencing at the same time that you deploy your initial topology or after you have deployed at least one Front End pool or Standard Edition server.

## Conferencing Deployment Process

The following table provides an overview of the steps required to deploy conferencing into an existing topology.

Lync Server 2013 now includes the **MaxUploadFileSizeMb** setting, which limits the size of files that can be uploaded during a meeting. The default value for this setting is 500 MB. You can adjust **MaxUploadFileSizeMb** using the **Set-CsConferencingConfiguration** cmdlet.

**MaxUploadFileSizeMb** does not limit the file upload setting for Lync Web App. The file size upload limit for Lync Web App is set to approximately 30MB and is controlled by the IIS web.config file: /DataCollabWeb/Int\[Ext\]/Handler/web.config. To configure the file size upload limit for Lync Web App, update `maxRequestLength` and `maxAllowedContentLength` in the web.config file as shown below.

    <system.web>
        <!-- 
            Since this handler is used to upload files to DMCU the request size (in kilobytes) 
            has to fit max allowed file size uploaded by LWA client.
            The timeout has to reflect the min client bandwidth. Timeout of 600 secs 
            and 512 Kbits of *client* bandwidth would result into aproximately 30 Mbytes 
            for LWA upload size limit.
        -->
          <httpRuntime maxRequestLength="500000" executionTimeout="600" />
    
    
    
                    <security>
                    <requestFiltering>
                               <requestLimits maxAllowedContentLength="524288000" />
                    </requestFiltering>
                    </security>

You must update the web.config file for each Front End Server.
