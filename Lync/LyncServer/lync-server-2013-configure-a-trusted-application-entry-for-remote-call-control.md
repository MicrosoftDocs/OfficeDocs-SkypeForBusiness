# Configure a trusted application entry for remote call control in Lync Server 2013

The SIP/CSTA gateway must be configured as a trusted application in order for Lync Server to apply a static route to route calls to the gateway.

<div>


> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're migrating users from a previous version of Lync Server deployment, be sure that you removed all existing trusted application entries (previously known as authorized host entries) you created for the SIP/CSTA gateway before following the procedures in this topic. For details, see <A href="lync-server-2013-remove-a-legacy-authorized-host-optional.md">Remove a legacy authorized host in Lync Server 2013 (optional)</A>.<BR>If you plan to deploy new remote call control by using a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection, you need to verify that <STRONG>Limit service usage to selected IP addresses</STRONG> should be set on existing trusted applications and pools, if you want to use the same TCP port for the new trusted application.

## To configure a trusted application entry for the SIP/CSTA gateway

1.  Log on to the computer where Lync Server Management Shell is installed as a member of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group or a role-based access control (RBAC) role to which you have assigned the **New-CsTrustedApplicationPool** cmdlet.

2.  Start the Lync Server Management Shell: Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft Lync Server 2013**, and then click **Lync Server Management Shell**.

3.  To create a trusted application entry, do one of the following:
    
      - For a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection, type the following at the command prompt:
        
            New-CsTrustedApplicationPool -Identity <FQDN of the SIP/CSTA gateway> [-Registrar <Service ID or FQDN of the Registrar service>] -Site <Site ID for the site where you want to create the trusted application pool>
        
        For example:
        
            New-CsTrustedApplicationPool -Identity rccgateway.contoso.net -Registrar registrar1.contoso.net -Site co1 -TreatAsAuthenticated $true -ThrottleAsServer $true
    
      - For a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection, type the following at the command prompt:
        
            New-CsTrustedApplicationPool -Identity <IP address or FQDN of the SIP/CSTA gateway> [-Registrar <Service ID or FQDN of the Registrar service>] -Site <Site ID for the site where you want to create the trusted application pool>
        
        For example:
        
            New-CsTrustedApplicationPool -Identity 192.168.0.240 -Registrar registrar1.contoso.net -Site co1 -TreatAsAuthenticated $true -ThrottleAsServer $true

4.  To add the trusted application to the pool, do one of the following:
    
      - For a TLS connection, type the following at the command prompt:
        
            New-CsTrustedApplication -ApplicationID <application name> -TrustedApplicationPoolFqdn <FQDN of the SIP/CSTA gateway> -Port <SIP listening port on the gateway>
        
        For example:
        
            New-CsTrustedApplication -ApplicationID RccGateway-1 -TrustedApplicationPoolFqdn rccgateway.contoso.net -Port 5065
    
      - For a TCP connection, type the following at the command prompt:
        
            New-CsTrustedApplication -ApplicationID <application name> -TrustedApplicationPoolFqdn <IP address or FQDN of the SIP/CSTA gateway> -Port <SIP listening port on the gateway> -EnableTcp
        
        For example:
        
            New-CsTrustedApplication -ApplicationID RccGateway-1 -TrustedApplicationPoolFqdn 192.169.0.240 -Port 5065 -EnableTcp

5.  To implement the published changes you have made to the topology, type the following at the command prompt:
    
        Enable-CsTopology
