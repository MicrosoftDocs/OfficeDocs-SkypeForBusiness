IP version 6 (IPv6) is not supported on Lync Server 2010 or Office Communications Server. For piloting purposes, you can test Lync Server 2010 and Lync Server 2013 dual-stack coexistence. We recommend that all pools for a given central site are upgraded to Lync Server 2013 before you enable IPv6 (dual-stack network) for any of the pools. If you need to configure a pool for IPv6 only, we recommend that you set up an IPv6-only pool in your lab environment for testing.

The following scenarios are supported during migration and coexistence:

  - Lync Server 2013, Lync Server 2010, and Office Communications Server 2007 R2 pools in IPv4 mode, coexisting with Lync Server 2013 in dual-stack mode.

  - Lync Server 2013 pool in IPv6-only mode, if the IPv6-only pool is siloed.
