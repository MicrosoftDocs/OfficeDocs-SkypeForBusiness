Building the topology involves the following planning and deployment tasks:

  - **Planning**   You need to define an appropriate topology for your organization and identify the components required to deploy it. These are standard steps in the planning process. The Microsoft Lync Server 2013, Planning Tool provided with Lync Server 2013 makes it easy to start the planning process, as well as including the ability to easily make changes as your requirements and plans are finalized.

  - **Deployment**   The topology that you define using Topology Builder is essential to the deployment of any Lync Server 2013 server. If you do not finish defining and publishing your topology by using Topology Builder as part of your planning efforts, you must complete it and publish the topology before you deploy your Edge Servers.

You cannot deploy Edge Server components until you have deployed at least one internal pool, and you must install Topology Builder to deploy an internal pool. This section does not cover installation of Topology Builder because that is part of the installation process for the internal pool.

For details about these tools, see [Deployment checklist for external user access in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-deployment-checklist-for-external-user-access.md).
