The Reference Architecture discussed in this document will help ensure that you have a Lync Server 2013 deployment that not only scales to the organization’s requirements but is architected as per Microsoft best practices. Be that as it may the Lync Server 2013 implementation is a dynamic service and like any other service in the enterprise still requires monitoring and proactive management to maintain high level of service availability and service quality to the business.

As Lync Server 2013 becomes deeply ingrained in the organization’s everyday business it is important that the service be managed by accurate and tangible service level management. The Lync system architecture can become complex and very integrated and in order to maintain effective service level management and establish SLAs for Lync Server 2013 it becomes critical to understand the system’s dependencies on other platforms and servers. Equally important is to note which business services, such as voice and UC integrated applications, become dependent on Lync.

Lync Server 2013 must be established noting all the said dependencies. The service map will allow you to formulate a SLA between Lync and its dependent service and provide a starting place for SLA negotiation.

The following table lists the typical dependency services for a Lync infrastructure. Each of these technologies should have its own proactive monitoring.

It is assumed that the organization is operationally mature in exercising basic service level management functions such as change, incident and release management as prescribed by the MOF. The Lync solution should be adopted by these functions and become subject to the same operational management processes.

Building on the information obtained above we now have a greater understanding of what can impact the Lync service in the enterprise. To help ensure Lync Server 2013 service availability and quality, the following monitoring tools must accompany the reference architecture deployment:

<p>We do not recommend that you use an existing Microsoft Lync Server 2013 server as a synthetic transaction watcher node. This is due to the high CPU/memory usage requirements for running STs. Use a new server computer (or a virtual server) for the synthetic transaction watcher node.</p></td>

Over and above the previous pro-active monitoring activities, maintenance tasks should be executed for Central, Edge and Branch sites on a recurring daily, weekly and monthly basis as defined in the Lync RA Operations Guide.
