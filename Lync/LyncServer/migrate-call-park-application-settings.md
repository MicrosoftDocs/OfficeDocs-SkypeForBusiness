The migration of the Call Park application from Lync Server 2010 to Lync Server 2013 includes provisioning the Lync Server 2013 pool with any custom music on hold files that have been uploaded in Lync Server 2010, restoring the service level settings and retargeting all Call Park orbits to the Lync Server 2013 pool. If customized music-on-hold files have been configured in the Lync Server 2010 pool, these files need to be copied to the new Lync Server 2013 pool. Additionally, it is recommended that you back up any Call Park customized music-on-hold files from Lync Server 2010 to another destination to keep a separate backup copy of any customized music-on-hold files that have been uploaded for Call Park. The customized music-on-hold files for the Call Park application are stored in the file store of the pool. To copy the audio files from a Lync Server 2010 pool file store to a Lync Server 2013 file store, use the **Xcopy** command with the following parameters:

   ```
    Xcopy <Source: Lync Server 2010 Pool CPS File Store Path> <Destination: Lync Server 2013 Pool CPS File Store Path>
   ```

   ```
    Example usage:  Xcopy "<Lync Server 2010 File Store Path>\OcsFileStore\coX-ApplicationServer-X\AppServerFiles\CPS\"  "<Lync Server 2013 File Store Path>\OcsFileStore\coX-ApplicationServer-X\AppServerFiles\CPS\" 
   ```

When all customized audio files have been copied to the Lync Server 2013 file store, the Call Park application settings of the Lync Server 2013 pool must be configured, and the Call Park orbit ranges that are associated with the Lync Server 2010 pool must be reassigned to the Lync Server 2013 pool.

The Call Park application settings include the pickup timeout threshold, enabling or disabling music on hold, the maximum call pickup attempts and the timeout request. You must manage Call Park application settings by using the Lync Server Management Shell to run the **Set-CsCpsConfiguration** cmdlet. You cannot manage the Call Park application settings using the Lync Server Control Panel.

**Reconfigure the Call Park Service Settings**

1.  From the Lync Server 2013 Front End Server, open the Lync Server Management Shell.

2.  At the command line, type the following:
    
    <div>
    

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If your Lync Server 2013 Call Park application settings are identical to the legacy Lync Server 2010 settings, you can skip running this step. If Call Park application settings are different for the Lync Server 2013 and Lync Server 2010 environments, use the cmdlet below as a template to update those changes.

    
    </div>
    
        Set-CsCpsConfiguration -Identity "<LS2013 Call Park Service ID>" -CallPickupTimeoutThreshold "<LS2010 CPS TimeSpan>" -EnableMusicOnHold "<LS2010 CPS value>" -MaxCallPickupAttempts "<LS2010 CPS pickup attempts>" -OnTimeoutURI "<LS2010 CPS timeout URI>"

To reassign all Call Park orbit ranges from Lync Server 2010 pool to the Lync Server 2013 pool, you can use either the Lync Server Control Panel or the Lync Server Management Shell.

**Reassign all Call Park Orbit Ranges using Lync Server Control Panel**

1.  Open Lync Server Control Panel.

2.  In the left pane, select **Voice Features**.

3.  Select the **Call Park** tab.

4.  For each Call Park orbit range assigned to a Lync Server 2010 pool, edit the **FQDN of destination server** setting and select the Lync Server 2013 pool that will process the Call Park requests.

5.  Select **Commit** to save the changes.

**Reassign all Call Park Orbit Ranges using Lync Server Management Shell**

1.  Open Lync Server Management Shell.

2.  At the command line, type the following:
    
        Get-CsCallParkOrbit
    
    This cmdlet lists all of the Call Park orbit ranges in the deployment. All Call Park orbits that have the **CallParkServiceId** and **CallParkServerFqdn** parameters set as the Lync Server 2010 pool must be reassigned.
    
    To reassign the Lync Server 2010 Call Park orbit ranges to the Lync Server 2013 pool, at the command line, type the following:
    
        Set-CsCallParkOrbit -Identity "<Call Park Orbit Identity>" -CallParkService "service:ApplicationServer:<Lync Server 2013 Pool FQDN>"

After reassigning all Call Park orbit ranges to the the Lync Server 2013 pool, the migration process for the Call Park application will be completed and the Lync Server 2013 pool will handle all future Call Park requests.
