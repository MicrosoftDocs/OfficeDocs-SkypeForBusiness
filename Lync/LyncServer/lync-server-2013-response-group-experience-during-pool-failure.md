# Response group experience in Lync Server 2013 during pool failure

</div>

<div id="mainSection">

<div id="mainBody">

<span> </span>

_**Topic Last Modified:** 2012-10-30_

This section describes in detail how response group activity is affected in the following stages:

  - An outage occurs in the primary pool, but failover is not yet initiated.

  - Service is failed over to the backup pool.

  - Service is failed back to the primary pool.

<div>

## User Experience When Outage Occurs

When a pool or site outage occurs, but the administrator has not yet initiated failover, response group activity is handled as described in the following table.

<div>


> [!NOTE]  
> During disaster recovery, calls behave differently depending on whether the primary pool response groups were imported to the backup pool during recovery. In the following table, references to imported response groups mean that primary pool response groups were imported to the backup pool during disaster recovery mode.

## User Experience During Failover

When an administrator invokes failover to a backup pool, response group activity is handled during and after the failover as described in the following table. The first column describes the type of activity that might be taking place. The middle column describes how each activity is handled during the brief time that it takes to fail over to the backup pool. The last column describes how the activity is handled for the duration, after the failover process is complete and the backup pool is standing in for the primary pool.

<div>


> [!NOTE]  
> During disaster recovery, calls behave differently depending on whether the primary pool response groups were imported to the backup pool during recovery. In the following table, references to imported response groups mean that primary pool response groups were imported to the backup pool during disaster recovery mode.

## User Experience During Failback

When an administrator invokes failback to the primary pool, response group activity is handled during and after the failback as described in the following table.

<div>


> [!NOTE]  
> During disaster recovery, calls behave differently depending on whether the primary pool response groups were imported to the backup pool during recovery. In the following table, references to imported response groups mean that primary pool response groups were imported to the backup pool during disaster recovery mode.
