The Lync 2013 client supports audio and video in a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environment. A user can connect an audio or video device (for example, a headset or a camera) to the local computer (for example, a thin client or repurposed computer). The user can connect to the virtual machine, sign in to the Lync 2013 client that is running on the virtual machine, and participate in real-time audio and video communications as though the client is running locally.

The Lync VDI Plug-in is a stand-alone application that installs on the local computer and allows the use of local audio and video devices with the Lync 2013 client running on the virtual machine. The plug-in does not require Lync to be installed on the local computer. After the user signs in to the Lync 2013 client that is running on the virtual machine, Lync prompts the user to re-enter his or her credentials to establish a connection with the Lync VDI Plug-in that is running on the local computer. After this connection is established, the user is ready to make and receive audio and video calls.
