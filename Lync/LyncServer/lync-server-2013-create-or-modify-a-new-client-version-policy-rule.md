Client version policy rules define the actions that should be taken when users attempt to log on with specific clients and client versions. You can create or modify individual rules for a client version policy from Lync Server 2013 Control Panel.

<div>


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Rules are listed in order of precedence. For example, if you have a rule that allows clients running version 1.5 to connect, followed by a rule that blocks clients running a version earlier than 2.0, the first rule takes precedence, and clients running version 1.5 are allowed to connect.
