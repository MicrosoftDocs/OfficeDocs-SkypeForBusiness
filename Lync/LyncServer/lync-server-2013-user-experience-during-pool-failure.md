If a pool is failed over, all users of the affected pool are forced to sign out and then sign into the backup pool. For a brief period users who sign into the backup pool may be in resiliency mode. In Resiliency mode, users are unable to perform tasks that would cause a persistent change on Lync Server, such as adding a contact. After the failover is complete, all users can get all services from the backup pool.

Any sessions a user has when the pool fails are disrupted, and the user must re-establish those sessions after failover to continue.

Users are not rehomed during failover or failback. Users who are homed on a pool that fails will be temporarily serviced by the backup pool. When the home pool is restored, the administrator can fail back these users to be serviced by their original home pool.

Note in Lync 2013, the Location Information Server database is not replicated to the backup pool. For best practice, the administrator should regularly back up the LIS database and use the latest backup copy to restore the LIS database in the backup pool after the failover.

## User Experience During Failover

When a user is in a pool that fails, the user is logged out. Any peer-to-peer session the user was participating in is terminated, as are conferences organized by that user. The user cannot log back in until either the registrar resiliency timer expires or the administrator initiates failover procedures, whichever comes first. When the user logs back in, they will log in to the backup pool. If they log in before the failover has completed, they will be in Resiliency mode until failover is complete. Only then the user is able to establish new sessions or re-establish previous sessions.

## User Experience During Failback

Pool failback can happen while an affected user is logged on to the backup pool, and the user remains logged on and working during the failback. Note that the failback process takes several minute to complete.  For reference, it is expected to take up to 60 minutes for a pool of 20,000 users.

The following tables show more details about how a user with a Lync 2013 client or a Microsoft Lync 2010 client is affected during and after failback, and also how users in other pools see and interact with a user in a pool who is being failed back. Users with Microsoft Office Communicator 2007 R2 clients cannot sign in until the Front End pool is completely failed back.)

The term *affected user* refers to any user who was failed over from the home pool and is being serviced by the backup pool. By definition, any user originally homed on the backup pool is not an affected user.
