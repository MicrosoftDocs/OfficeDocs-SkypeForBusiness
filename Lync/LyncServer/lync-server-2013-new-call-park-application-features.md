The Call Park application makes it possible for Enterprise Voice users to put a call on hold and then retrieve it later from any phone. The user who parked the call can either dial the orbit number provided by Call Park to retrieve the parked call or use an external mechanism, such as instant messaging (IM) or a paging system, to ask someone else to retrieve the call.

Lync Server 2013 provides new disaster recovery mechanisms in the form of failover and failback processes. These failover and failback processes support recovery of Call Park functionality by allowing users who are homed in the primary pool to leverage the Call Park application of the backup pool when an outage occurs in the primary pool. Support for disaster recovery of the Call Park application is enabled as part of the configuration and deployment of paired Front End pools.
