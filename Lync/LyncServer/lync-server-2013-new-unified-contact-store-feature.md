Lync Server 2013 introduces unified contact store. Unified contact store allows users to keep all their contact information in Microsoft Exchange Server 2013. After users' Lync contacts are migrated to Exchange 2013, the users can access and manage their contacts from Lync 2013, Outlook, or Outlook Web App, and their Favorites stay synchronized. For example, if a user adds a contact to Favorites in Outlook, the contact appears in the Favorites group in Lync 2013. Users do not need to be logged in to Lync to manage their contacts from Outlook or Outlook Web App.

Unified contact store is enabled by default. You can enable or disable users for unified contact store globally, by site, by tenant, or by individuals or groups of individuals.
