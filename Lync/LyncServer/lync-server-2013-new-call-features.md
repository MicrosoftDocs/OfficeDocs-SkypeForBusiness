Lync Server 2013 provides a significantly wider range of configuration options for call forwarding and simultaneous ringing. For example, if an organization does not want incoming calls to be forwarded externally to the public switched telephone network (PSTN), an administrator can apply a special voice policy to deploy this restriction.

Additionally, delegates can now set up simultaneous ringing to their mobile devices for incoming calls to their managers. This provides delegates with more flexibility, enabling them to answer calls on behalf of their manager without being tied to a desk phone.
