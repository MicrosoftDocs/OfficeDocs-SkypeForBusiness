The information in this topic pertains to Cumulative Updates for Lync Server 2013: February 2013.

Location-Based Routing makes it possible to restrict the routing of calls between VoIP endpoints and PSTN endpoints based on the location of the parties in the call. Location-Based Routing is part of the Lync Server 2013 Enterprise Voice infrastructure. Location-Based Routing is a call management feature that controls how calls are routed by Lync Server 2013 CU1. It enforces call authorization rules on whether calls can be routed to PBX or PSTN endpoints based on the Lync caller’s geographic location.
