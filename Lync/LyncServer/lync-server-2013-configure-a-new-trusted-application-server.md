A trusted application is an application based on Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API (UCMA) 3.0 Core SDK that is trusted by Microsoft Lync Server 2013. For details about UCMA applications, see “Unified Communications Managed API 3.0 Core SDK Documentation” at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=210320](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=210320).

For information about configuring Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) and Lync Server 2013, see “Configure Outlook Web App and Lync Server 2010 Integration” at the Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 documentation.

To successfully publish, enable, or disable a topology when adding or removing a server role, you should be logged on as a user who is a member of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins and Domain Admins groups. It is also possible to delegate the proper administrator permissions and rights for adding server roles. For details, see [Delegate setup permissions in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-delegate-setup-permissions.md) in the Deployment documentation. For other configuration changes, only membership in the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group is required.
