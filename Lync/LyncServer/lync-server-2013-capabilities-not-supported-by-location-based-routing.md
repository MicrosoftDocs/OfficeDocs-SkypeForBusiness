Location-Based Routing does not apply to the following types of interactions. Location-Based Routing is not enforced when Lync endpoints interact with PSTN endpoints using these capabilities.

  - PSTN dial-in to conferences

  - Incoming and outgoing PSTN calls through Response Group

  - Call park or retrieval of PSTN calls through Call Park

  - Incoming PSTN calls to Announcement Service

  - Incoming PSTN calls retrieved via Group Call Pickup

To enforce Location-Based Routing rules to the types of interactions in the following list, you must enable Location-Based Routing for Conferencing:

  - PSTN dial-out from conferences

  - Escalations from peer-to-peer audio conversations to conferencing involving PSTN endpoints

  - Consultative transfers involving PSTN endpoints

To enable Location-Based Routing for Conferencing, see [Location-Based Routing for conferencing in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-location-based-routing-for-conferencing.md).
