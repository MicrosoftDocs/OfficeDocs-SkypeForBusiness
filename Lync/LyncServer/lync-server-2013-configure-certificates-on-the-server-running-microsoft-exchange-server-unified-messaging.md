If you have deployed Exchange Unified Messaging (UM), as described in [Planning for Exchange Unified Messaging integration in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-planning-for-exchange-unified-messaging-integration.md) in the Planning documentation, and you want to provide Exchange UM features to Enterprise Voice users in your organization, you can use the following procedures to configure the certificate on the server running Exchange UM.

<div>


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For internal certificates, both the servers running Lync Server 2013 and the servers running Microsoft Exchange must have trusted root authority certificates that are mutually trusted. The certification authority (CA) can either be the same, or a different certification authority, as long as the servers have the certification authority’s root certificate registered in their trusted root authority certificate store.



</div>

The Exchange Server must be configured with a server certificate in order to connect to Lync Server 2013:

1.  Download the CA certificate for the Exchange Server.

2.  Install the CA certificate for the Exchange Server.

3.  Verify that the CA is in the list of trusted root CAs of the Exchange Server.

4.  Create a certificate request for the Exchange Server and install the certificate.

5.  Assign the certificate for the Exchange Server.

<div>

## To download the CA certificate

1.  On the server running Exchange UM, click **Start**, click **Run**, type **http://\<name of your Issuing CA Server\>/certsrv**, and then click **OK**.

2.  Under **Select a task**, click **Download a CA certificate, certificate chain, or CRL**.

3.  Under **Download a CA Certificate, Certificate Chain, or CRL**, select **Encoding Method to Base 64**, and then click **Download CA certificate**.
    
    <div>
    

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You can also specify Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) encoding at this step. If you select DER encoding, the file type in the next step of this procedure and in step 10 of <STRONG>To Install the CA certificate</STRONG> is .p7b rather than .cer.

    
    </div>

4.  In the **File Download** dialog box, click **Save**, and then save the file to the hard disk on the server. (The file will have either a .cer or a .p7b file extension, depending on the encoding that you selected in the previous step.)

</div>

<div>

## To install the CA certificate

1.  On the server running Exchange UM, open Microsoft Management Console (MMC) by clicking **Start**, clicking **Run**, typing **mmc** in the **Open** box, and then clicking **OK**.

2.  On the **File** menu, click **Add/Remove Snap-in**, and then click **Add**.

3.  In the **Add Standalone Snap-ins** box, click **Certificates**, and then click **Add**.

4.  In the **Certificate snap-in** dialog box, click **Computer account**, and then click **Next**.

5.  In the **Select Computer** dialog box, verify that the **Local computer: (the computer this console is running on)** check box is selected, and then click **Finish**.

6.  Click **Close**, and then click **OK**.

7.  In the console tree, expand **Certificates (Local Computer)**, expand **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**, and then click **Certificates**.

8.  Right-click **Certificates**, click **All Tasks**, and click **Import**.

9.  Click **Next**.

10. Click **Browse** to locate the file, and then click **Next**. (The file will have either a .cer or a .p7b file extension, depending on the encoding that you selected in step 3 of **To download the CA certificate**.

11. Click **Place All Certificates in the following store**.

12. Click **Browse**, and then select **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**.

13. Click **Next** to verify the settings, and then click **Finish**.

</div>

<div>

## To verify that the CA is in the list of trusted root CAs

1.  On the server running Exchange UM, in MMC expand **Certificates (Local Computer)**, expand **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**, and then click **Certificates**.

2.  In the details pane, verify that your CA is on the list of trusted CAs.
