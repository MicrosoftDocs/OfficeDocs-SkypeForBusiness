The Peer-to-Peer Activity Summary Report provides an overall view of your peer-to-peer communication sessions. A peer-to-peer session typically involves just two users, and does not require the use of the Lync Server conferencing services. By comparison, a conference typically involves more than two users and requires the use of Microsoft Lync Server 2013 conferencing services. Conference activity is reported on the Conference Summary Report.

The Peer-to-Peer Activity Summary Report helps you answer questions like the following:

  - How many peer-to-peer instant messages do my users send on a typical day?

  - Are any of my users actually taking advantage of the Lync Server application sharing and file transfer capabilities?

  - Users have been complaining that the network seems slow at certain times of the day. How many minutes are devoted to peer-to-peer audio and video sessions during those time periods?

## Filters

Filters provide a way for you to return a more finely targeted set of data or to view the returned data in different ways. For example, the Peer-to-Peer Activity Summary Report enables you to choose how data should be grouped. In this case, activity grouped by hour, day, week, or month.

The following table lists the filters that you can use with the Peer-to-Peer Activity Summary Report.
