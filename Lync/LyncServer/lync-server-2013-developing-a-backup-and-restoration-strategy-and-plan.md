The effectiveness of your Lync Server backup and restoration operations depends on your backup and restoration strategy and plan. You should establish a strategy for backing up and restoring Lync Server that fits with your organization's overall strategy, and a comprehensive, concise plan for backing up data and settings, and, in the event of an outage, a plan for restoring service.

For the most robust disaster recovery of a Front End Pool, use the paired-pool disaster recovery topology introduced in Lync Server 2013. For more information, see [Planning for high availability and disaster recovery in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-planning-for-high-availability-and-disaster-recovery.md).
