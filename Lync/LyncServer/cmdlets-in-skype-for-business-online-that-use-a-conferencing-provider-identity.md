# Cmdlets in Skype for Business Online that use a conferencing provider identity

 


To return information about all of the audio conferencing providers that your organization has contracted with, you can simply call the [Get-CsAudioConferencingProvider](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj994030\(v=ocs.15\)) cmdlet without any parameters:

    Get-CsAudioConferencingProvider

If you want to limit the returned data to a single provider (in this example, the provider Contoso Audio Services), then use the Identity parameter:

    Get-CsAudioConferencingProvider -Identity "Contoso Audio Services"

There is only one Skype for Business Online cmdlet that accepts an audio conferencing provider ID:

  - [Get-CsAudioConferencingProvider](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj994030\(v=ocs.15\))
