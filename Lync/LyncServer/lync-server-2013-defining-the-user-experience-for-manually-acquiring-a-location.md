If a client is located outside the network, or in an undefined subnet, the user can manually enter a location. But during an emergency call, the call will first be routed to a national/regional E9-1-1 Emergency Call Response Center (ECRC) dispatcher before being routed to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). The ECRC will verbally query the caller for a location and then forward the call to the appropriate PSAP, based on the information provided.

  - **Should users be prompted to enter a location when one is not automatically provided by the Location Information service?**  
    For example, if a client is located in an undefined subnet, at home, in a hotel, or anywhere else outside the network, should the user be required to enter a location?
    
    You can configure the **Location Required** setting in the location policy to define the client behavior. Setting this value to No means that the user will not be prompted for a location. Setting this value to Yes means that the user will be prompted for a location, but can dismiss the prompt. Setting this value to Disclaimer means that the user will be prompted for a location, and will be shown a disclaimer if they try to dismiss the prompt. In all cases, the user can continue to use the client as usual.

When a user manually enters a location, the location is mapped to the MAC address of the default gateway of the client’s network, and is stored in a per-user table located on the client. When the user returns to any previously stored location, the Lync client automatically sets itself to that location.

> [!NOTE]
> You can modify only the current location of your client, but you can also delete any location stored in the local user’s table.
