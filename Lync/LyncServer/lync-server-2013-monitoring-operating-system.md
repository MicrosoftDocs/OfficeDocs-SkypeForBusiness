You must monitor the performance of all servers and components in the Lync Server 2013. Obviously, one of the most important components is the operating system itself. Lync Server 2013 supports x64 editions of:

  - Windows Server 2008 R2

  - Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2

The most transparent way to monitor an operating system is by using Windows Server Operating System Management Pack. It provides the fundamental monitoring basics, such as performance, health, and availability for computers that are running Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows Server 2008 R2.

By detecting, alerting, and automatically responding to important events and performance indicators, these management packs reduce resolution times for issues and increase the overall availability and performance of systems that are running the Windows Server operating systems.

Apart from relevant Windows Server management packs for System Center Operations Manager, the following system tools and resources can be used to monitor the health of the operating system (depending on the operating system version).

## Windows Server 2008 R2

Windows Server 2008 R2 includes the following additional features and tools to help administrators with basic operating system monitoring and management:

  - **Windows Resource Monitor** is a powerful tool for understanding how system resources are used by processes and services. In addition to monitoring resource usage in real time, a Resource Monitor can help analyze unresponsive processes, identify which applications are using files, and control processes and services.

  - **Reliability Analysis Component** is an in-box agent that provides detailed experience information on system usage and reliability. This information is exposed through a WMI interface to make it available for consumption by Portable Readers Systems. By exposing Reliability Analysis Component through a WMI interface, developers can monitor and analyze applications, increasing reliability and performance.

  - **Windows Server 2008 R2** uses the built-in Reliability Analysis Component to calculate a reliability index, which provides information about overall system usage and stability over time. The Reliability Analysis Component also keeps track of any important changes to the system that are likely to influence stability, such as Windows updates and application installations.

## Windows Server 2008 Windows Reliability and Performance Monitor

Windows Reliability and Performance Monitor is an MMC Snap-in that combines the functionality of previous stand-alone tools including Performance Logs and Alerts, Server Performance Advisor, and System Monitor. It provides a graphical interface for customizing performance data collection and Event Trace Sessions.

It also includes Reliability Monitor, an MMC Snap-in that tracks changes to the system and compares them to changes in system stability, and it provides a graphical view of their relationship.

## Windows Reliability and Performance Monitor

While Windows Reliability and Performance Monitor combine functionalities of some former stand-alone tools such as Performance Logs and Alerts, and System Monitor and Server Performance Advisor, it also provides some new functionality to Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2, such as the following:

  - Data Collector Sets

  - Resource View

  - Reliability Monitor

  - Wizards and templates for creating logs

**Data Collector Set** groups data collectors into reusable elements for use with different performance monitoring scenarios. After a group of data collectors are stored as a Data Collector Set, operations such as scheduling can be applied to the whole set through a single property change.Windows Reliability and Performance Monitor includes default Data Collector Set templates to help system administrators begin immediately collecting performance data that is specific to a server role or monitoring scenario.

The home page of Windows Reliability and Performance Monitor is the new **Resource View** screen, which provides a real-time graphical overview of CPU, disk, network, and memory usage. By expanding each of these monitored elements, system administrators can identify which processes are using which resources. In earlier versions of Windows, this real-time, process-specific data was available only in limited form in Task Manager.

**Reliability Monitor** calculates a System Stability Index that reflects whether unexpected issues reduced the reliability of the system. A graph of the Stability Index over time quickly identifies dates when issues began to occur. The accompanying System Stability Report provides details to help troubleshoot the cause of reduced reliability. By viewing changes to the system (installation or removal of applications, updates to the operating system, or addition or modification of drivers) side by side with failures (application failures, operating system crashes, or hardware failures), a strategy for addressing the issues can be developed quickly.

Adding counters to log files and scheduling their start, stop, and duration can now be performed through a **Wizard interface**. In addition, saving this configuration as a template enables system administrators to collect the same log on other computers without repeating the data collector selection and scheduling processes. Performance Logs and Alerts features were incorporated into the Windows Reliability and Performance Monitor for use with any Data Collector Set.
