To successfully complete this procedure, you should be logged on to the server, at the minimum, as a local administrator and a domain user who has membership in at least the RTCUniversalReadOnlyAdmins group.

Use the steps in this topic to run Lync Server 2013 Deployment Wizard to install the files for Mediation Server on a computer that you added to a Mediation Server pool when you used Topology Builder to define and publish the pool. When installing files Mediation Server, you also install and assign the certificate required by each computer in a Mediation Server pool.

At this site, if you have already deployed Mediation Servers collocated on the Front End pools or Standard Edition server, you can skip this topic and, instead, continue to [Configuring trunks in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-configuring-trunks.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> This topic assumes that you have already defined and published a stand-alone Mediation Server pool as described in <A href="lync-server-2013-define-a-mediation-server-in-topology-builder.md">Define a Mediation Server in Topology Builder in Lync Server 2013</A> and <A href="lync-server-2013-publish-the-topology.md">Publish the topology in Lync Server 2013</A> in the Deployment documentation, and that you have verified that the computers in the Mediation Server pool meet the prerequisites described in <A href="lync-server-2013-software-prerequisites-for-enterprise-voice.md">Software prerequisites for Enterprise Voice in Lync Server 2013</A> and <A href="lync-server-2013-security-and-configuration-prerequisites-for-enterprise-voice.md">Security and configuration prerequisites for Enterprise Voice in Lync Server 2013</A>.

## To install the files for a stand-alone Mediation Server pool

1.  From the installation media, right-click \<installation media\>**\\Setup\\amd64\\Setup.exe**, and then click **Run as Administrator**.

2.  On the **Installation Location** page, click **OK**.

3.  On the **End User License Agreement** page, click **I accept**, and then click **OK**. (Required to continue.)

4.  On the **Lync Server 2010 Deployment Wizard** page, click **Install or Update Lync Server System**.

5.  Next to **Step 1: Install Local Configuration Store**, click **Run**, and then follow the instructions on the screen.

6.  On the **Configure Local Replica of Central Management Store** page, accept the default **Retrieve directly from the Central Management Store**, and then click **Next**.

7.  On the **Executing Commands** page, when the task status is shown as **Completed**, click **Finish**.

8.  Next to **Step 2: Setup or Remove Lync Server Components**, click **Run**, and then click **Next**.

9.  On the **Executing Commands** page, when the task status is shown as **Completed**, click **Finish**.

10. Next to **Step 3: Request, Install or Assign Certificates**, click **Run**. Follow the instructions on the screen, accepting the default settings. The Mediation Server requires one certificate, and so you will run **Step 3** twice: once to issue the required certificate, and once more to assign it.

11. When the certificate has been issued and assigned correctly, beside **Step 4: Start Services**, click **Run**, and then follow the instructions on the screen.

12. When **Step 4** has completed successfully, restart the server, and log on to the server as a member of the DomainAdmins group.

13. On the computer where you are running Lync Server Control Panel, verify on the **Topology** page of Lync Server Control Panel that the service status of the Mediation Server is shown as a green check mark. If a red X appears instead, select the Mediation Server. On the **Action** menu, click **Start All Services**.

If you added more than one computer to the Mediation Server pool, perform the steps in this procedure on all other computers in the Mediation Server pool. If you do not need to install files for Mediation Server for any other computers, then follow the procedures in [Configuring trunks in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-configuring-trunks.md) to configure settings for the trunk connection between this Mediation Server pool (or all Mediation Servers at a site) and its peer.
