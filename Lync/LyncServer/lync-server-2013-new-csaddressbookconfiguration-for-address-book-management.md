Who can run this cmdlet: By default, members of the following groups are authorized to run the New-CsAddressBookConfiguration cmdlet locally: RTCUniversalServerAdmins. To return a list of all the role-based access control (RBAC) roles this cmdlet has been assigned to (including any custom RBAC roles you have created yourself), run the following command from the Windows PowerShell prompt:

    Get-CsAdminRole | Where-Object {$_.Cmdlets -match "New-CsAddressBookConfiguration"}

The New-CsAddressBookConfiguration cmdlet creates a new configuration to manage the behavior of the Address book. Specific to this cmdlet is the ability to define if the Address Book Service creates the client download files, how and if normalization rules are used, how long to retain delta and compact delta files, delta file size before incorporating a new full file creation, what time of day the full file Address Book is created, and what the internal should be for synchronization of information in the User database.

For example:

    New-CsAddressBookConfiguration -Identity site:Redmond -KeepDuration 15 -SynchronizePollingInterval 00:10:00
