After creating a Lync Server user policy, you must apply it to specific the users or user groups that are homed on Lync Server 2013 before it can take effect. For details about creating user policies for specific users, see [Creating and configuring user policies for Archiving in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-creating-and-configuring-user-policies-for-archiving-in-lync-server.md) in the Deployment documentation.

For details about how Archiving policies work, including the hierarchy for global, site, and user policies, see [How Archiving works in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-how-archiving-works.md) in the Planning documentation, Deployment documentation, or Operations documentation.

> [!NOTE]  
> In order to configure and use archiving, you must first deploy archiving. For details, see <A href="lync-server-2013-deploying-archiving.md">Deploying Archiving in Lync Server 2013</A> in the Deployment documentation.<BR>If you enabled Microsoft Exchange integration for your deployment, Exchange In-Place Hold policies control whether archiving is enabled for the users who are homed on Exchange 2013 and have their mailboxes put on In-Place Hold. For details, see <A href="lync-server-2013-setting-up-policies-for-archiving-when-using-exchange-server-integration.md">Setting up policies for Archiving in Lync Server 2013 when using Exchange Server integration</A> in the Deployment documentation.<BR>You should specify all appropriate options in the Archiving configurations before enabling Archiving. For details, see <A href="lync-server-2013-configuring-archiving-options.md">Configuring Archiving options in Lync Server 2013</A> in the Deployment documentation.
