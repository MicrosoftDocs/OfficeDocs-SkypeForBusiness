Calls routed via PSTN gateways and PBXs might require Location-Based Routing restrictions depending on the location of such systems. Location-Based Routing can be enabled at the granularity on a per trunk basis.

Location-Based Routing introduces the following set of rules when enabled on a trunk:

  - When Location-Based Routing is enabled on a per trunk basis, the rules define on that trunk will be applied only to calls routed through that trunk.

  - To prevent PSTN tolls bypass where calls originate from a network site different that the network site where the PSTN gateway is located, Location-Based Routing introduces the association of a network site to a given trunk. This defines the network site that allows calls to be routed to a given trunk.

Trunks can be enabled for Location-Based Routing in two ways:

  - The trunk is defined for a PSTN gateway that egresses calls to the PSTN. Incoming calls routed by a trunk of this type will be routed only to endpoints located within the same network site as the trunk.

  - The trunk is defined for a Mediation Server peer that doesn’t egress calls to the PSTN and services users with legacy phones in a static locations (i.e. PBX phones). For this particular configuration, all incoming calls routed by a trunk of this type will be considered to be originating from the same network site as the trunk. Calls from PBX users will have the same Location-Based Routing enforcement as Lync users who are located in the same network site as the trunk. If two PBX systems located in separate network sites are connected through Lync Server, Location-Based Routing will allow routing from one PBX endpoint in one network site to another PBX endpoint in the other network site. This scenario will not be blocked by Location-Based Routing. In addition to this scenario and in a similar way as a Lync user in the same location, endpoints connected to a Mediation Server peer with this configuration will be able to make or receive calls to and from other Mediation Server peer that do not route calls to the PSTN (i.e. an endpoint connected to a different PBX) regardless of the network site to which the Mediation Server peer is associated. All inbound calls, outbound calls, call transfers and call forwards involving PSTN endpoints will be subject to Location Based Routing to use only PSTN gateways that are defined as local to such Mediation Server peer.
