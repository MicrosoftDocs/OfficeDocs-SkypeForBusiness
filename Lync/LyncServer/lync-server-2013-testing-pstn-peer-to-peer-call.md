## Description

The Test-CsPstnPeerToPeerCall cmdlet verifies the ability a pair of users has to conduct a peer-to-peer call over the public switched telephone network (PSTN) gateway. When you call Test-CsPstnPeerToPeerCall, the cmdlet will first attempt to log on two test users to Lync Server. Assuming that the logons succeed, the cmdlet will then have user 1 attempt to call user 2 over the PSTN gateway. Test-CsPstnPeerToPeerCall will make this call using the dial plan, voice policy, and other policy and configuration settings assigned to the test user. If the test goes as planned, the cmdlet will verify that user 2 was able to answer the call, and then log off both test accounts from the system.

Test-CsPstnPeerToPeerCall makes an actual phone call, one that verifies that a connection can be made and that also transmits DTMF codes over the network to determine whether media can be sent over the connection. The call is answered by the cmdlet itself, and no manual termination of the call is necessary. (That is, no one must answer and then hang up the phone that was called.)

## Running the test

The Test-CsPstnPeerToPeerCall cmdlet can be run using either a pair of preconfigured test accounts (see Setting Up Test Accounts for Running Lync Server Tests) or the accounts of any two users who are enabled for Lync Server. To run this check using test accounts, you just have to specify the FQDN of the Lync Server pool being tested. For example:

`Test-CsPstnPeerToPeerCall -TargetFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"`

To run this check using actual user accounts, you must create two Windows PowerShell credentials objects (objects that contain the account name and password) for each account. You must then include those credentials objects and the SIP addresses of the two accounts when you call Test-CsPstnPeerToPeerCall:

    $credential1 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\kenmyer"
    $credential2 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\davidlongmire"
    Test-CsPstnPeerToPeerCall -TargetFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -SenderSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -SenderCredential $credential1 -ReceiverSipAddress "sip:davidlongmire@litwareinc.com" -ReceiverCredential $credential2

For more information, see the Help documentation for the [Test-CsPstnPeerToPeerCall](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/skype/Test-CsPstnPeerToPeerCall) cmdlet.

## Determining success or failure

If the specified users can complete a peer-to-peer call, you'll receive output similar to this, with the Result property marked as **Success:**

TargetFqdn : atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com

Result : Success

Latency : 00:00:06.8630376

Error :

Diagnosis :

If the specified users can't complete a peer-to-peer call, then the Result will be shown as Failure, and additional information will be recorded in the Error and Diagnosis properties:

TargetFqdn : atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com

Result : Failure

Latency : 00:00:0182361

Error : 403, Forbidden

Diagnosis : ErrorCode=12001,Source=atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com,

Reason=User Policy does not contain phone route usage

The previous output states that the test failed because the voice policy assigned to at least one of the specified users does not include a phone usage. (Phone usages tie voice policies to voice routes. Without both a voice policy and a corresponding voice route, you can't make calls over the PSTN.)

If Test-CsPstnPeerToPeerCall fails, then you might want to rerun the test, this time including the Verbose parameter:

    Test-CsPstnPeerToPeerCall -TargetFqdn "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com" -Verbose

When the Verbose parameter is included, Test-CsPstnPeerToPeerCall will return a step-by-step account of each action it tried when it checked the ability of the specified user to log on to Lync Server. For example, this output indicates that network problems are preventing a connection with the PSTN:

Establishing Audio Video call to 'sip:+12065551219@litwareinc.com;user=phone'.

An exception 'A 404 (Not Found) response was received from the network and the operation failed.

## Reasons why the test might have failed

Here are some common reasons why Test-CsPstnPeerToPeerCall might fail:

  - You specified a user account that is not valid. You can verify that a user account exists by running a command similar to this:
    
        Get-CsUser "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com"

  - The user account is valid, but the account is currently not enabled for Lync Server. To verify that a user account is enabled for Lync Server, run a command similar to the following:
    
        Get-CsUser "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" | Select-Object Enabled
    
    If the Enabled property is set to False, that means that the user is currently not enabled for Lync Server.

  - The voice policy assigned to the specified user does not have a valid PSTN usage. You can determine the voice policy that is assigned to a user by using a command similar to this:
    
        Get-CsUser "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" | Select-Object VoicePolicy
    
    And then you can determine the PSTN usages (if any) that are assigned to that policy by using a command similar to the following, which retrieves information about the per-user voice policy RedmondVoicePolicy:
    
        Get-CsVoicePolicy -Identity "RedmondVoicePolicy"
