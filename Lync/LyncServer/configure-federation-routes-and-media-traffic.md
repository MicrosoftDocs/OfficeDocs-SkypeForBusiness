_**Topic Last Modified:** 2012-10-15_

Federation is a trust relationship between two or more SIP domains that permits users in separate organizations to communicate across network boundaries. After you migrate to your Lync Server 2013 pilot pool, you need to transition from the federation route of your Lync Server 2010 Edge Servers to the federation route of your Lync Server 2013 Edge Servers.

Use the following procedures to transition the federation route and the media traffic route from your Lync Server 2010 Edge Server and Director to your Lync Server 2013 Edge Server, for a single-site deployment.

<div>


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Changing the federation route and media traffic route requires that you schedule maintenance downtime for the Lync Server 2013 and Lync Server 2010 Edge Servers. This entire transition process also means that federated access will be unavailable for the duration of the outage. You should schedule the downtime for a time when you expect minimal user activity. You should also provide sufficient notification to your end users. Plan accordingly for this outage and set appropriate expectations within your organization.



</div>

<div>


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If your legacy Lync Server 2010 Edge Server is configured to use the same FQDN for the Access Edge service, Web Conferencing Edge service, and the A/V Edge service, the procedures in this section are not supported. If the legacy Edge services are configured to use the same FQDN, you must first migrate all your users from Lync Server 2010 to Lync Server 2013, then decommission the Lync Server 2010 Edge Server before enabling federation on the Lync Server 2013 Edge Server.



</div>

<div>


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If your XMPP federation is routed through a Lync Server 2013 Edge Server, legacy Lync Server 2010 users will not be able to communicate with the XMPP federated partner until all users have been moved to Lync Server 2013, XMPP policies and certificates have been configured, the XMPP federated partner has been configured on Lync Server 2013, and lastly the DNS entries have been updated.

2.  From the **Action** menu, select **Publish Topology** and complete the wizard.

3.  Wait for Active Directory replication to occur to all pools in the deployment.
    
    <div>
    

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You may see the following message:<BR><STRONG>Warning: The topology contains more than one Federated Edge Server. This can occur during migration to a more recent version of the product. In that case, only one Edge Server would be actively used for federation. Verify that the external DNS SRV record points to the correct Edge Server. If you want to deploy multiple federation Edge Server to be active concurrently (that is, not a migration scenario), verify that all federated partners are using Lync Server. Verify that the external DNS SRV record lists all federation enabled Edge Servers.</STRONG><BR>This warning is expected and can be safely ignored.

    
    </div>

</div>

<div>

## To configure Lync Server 2013 Edge Server

1.  Bring all of the Lync Server 2013 Edge Servers online.

2.  Update the external firewall routing rules or the hardware load balancer settings to send SIP traffic for external access (usually port 443) and federation (usually port 5061) to the Lync Server 2013 Edge Server, instead of the legacy Edge Server.
    
    <div>
    

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you do not have a hardware load balancer, you need to update the DNS A record for federation to resolve to the new Lync Server Access Edge server. To accomplish this with minimum disruption, reduce the TLL value for the external Lync Server Access Edge FQDN so that when DNS is updated to point to the new Lync Server Access Edge, federation and remote access will be updated quickly.

    
    </div>

3.  Next, stop the **Lync Server Access Edge** from each Edge Server computer.

4.  From each legacy Edge Server computer, open the **Services** applet from the **Administrative Tools**.

5.  In the services list, find **Lync Server Access Edge**.

6.  Right-click the services name, and then select **Stop** to stop the service.

7.  Set the Startup type to **Disabled**.

8.  Click **OK** to close the **Properties** window.
