Microsoft Lync 2013 Microsoft Lync 2013 for Android provides instant messaging (IM), enhanced presence, and Lync meeting join capabilities for users in your organization who are connecting from an Android device. This topic describes considerations for Lync 2013 for Android, including prerequisites, technical requirements, and required components.

<div>

## Lync for Android Prerequisite

To support Lync 2013 for Android, the Android device must meet the following requirements:

  - The Android device must be running Android 4.0 or a later phone- or tablet-oriented operating system, including tablets, except those with the Tegra2 chip.

  - The device must have a 1.2 GHz dual core or higher CPU.

  - The device camera (front/rear) resolution should be VGA or higher.

  - Other hardware requirements should be aligned with Android 4.0 Compatibility Definition Document.

## Other Technical Considerations

On the Android device platform, the Lync application can run in the background. Therefore, unlike other mobile device platforms, push notifications are not required for Android devices. The only way to exit the Lync application on an Android device is to explicitly sign out of Lync. This version of the Lync application is not supported on devices with Tegra 2 chipsets.
