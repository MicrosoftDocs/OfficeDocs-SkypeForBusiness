To federate with a Lync Online 2010 customer, you should have already completed initial deployment and configuration of Lync Server 2013 in your organization. This includes the following:

  - Deploying at least one Standard Edition server or one Enterprise Edition Front End pool in your organization. For details about deploying internal servers, see [Deploying Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-deploying-lync-server.md) in the Deployment documentation.

  - Enabling internal user accounts for Lync Server 2013. For details, see [Disable or re-enable user account for Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-disable-or-re-enable-user-account-for-lync-server.md) in the Deployment documentation or the Operations documentation.

  - Deploying at least one Edge Server and the other components required to support external user access. For details, see [Managing federation and external access to Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-managing-federation-and-external-access-to-lync-server-2013.md) in the Deployment documentation.

  - Enabling federation support within your organization and configuring the appropriate method for controlling access by federated domains. For details, see [Enable or disable remote user access in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-enable-or-disable-remote-user-access.md) and [Manage SIP federated providers for your organization in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-manage-sip-federated-providers-for-your-organization.md) in the Operations documentation.

  - Enabling external user access for users in your organization. For details, see [Assign an external user access policy to a Lync enabled user in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-assign-an-external-user-access-policy-to-a-lync-enabled-user.md) and in the Deployment documentation or Operations documentation.
