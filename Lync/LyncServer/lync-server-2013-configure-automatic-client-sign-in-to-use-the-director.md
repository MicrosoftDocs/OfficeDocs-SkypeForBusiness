When you deploy a Lync Server 2013, Director or a pool of Directors, we recommend that you use Automatic Client Sign-In as a best practice. For details about how to configure DNS servers for automatic client sign-in, see [DNS requirements for automatic client sign-in in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-dns-requirements-for-automatic-client-sign-in.md) in the Planning documentation.

If you have already deployed Automatic Client Sign-In, see the following sections to configure it on your Director(s).

<div>

## Single Director Instance

If you already have Automatic Client Sign-In deployed and it is pointing to a Front End Server or a Front End pool, you need to change the DNS SRV record to point to the Director.

<div>

## Director Pool

If you already have Automatic Client Sign-In deployed and it is pointing to a Front End Server or a Front End pool, you need to change the DNS SRV record to point to the Director pool.
