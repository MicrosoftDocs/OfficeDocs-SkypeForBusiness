      FROM tblChat, tblNode
      WHERE channelId = nodeID AND dbo.fnTicksToDate(chatDate) > '1/1/2011'
      GROUP BY nodeName
      ORDER BY ChatMessages DESC

Use the following example to get a list of your most active users after a certain date.

    SELECT prinName as Name, count(*) as ChatMessages
      FROM tblChat, tblPrincipal
      WHERE prinID = userId AND dbo.fnTicksToDate(chatDate) > '1/1/2011'
      GROUP BY prinName
      ORDER BY ChatMessages DESC

Use the following example to get a list of everyone who ever sent a message with "Hello World" in it.

    SELECT nodeName as ChatRoom, prinName as Name, content as Message
      FROM tblChat, tblNode, tblPrincipal
      WHERE channelId = nodeID AND userId = prinID AND content like '%Hello World%'

    SELECT prinName as Name    
      FROM tblPrincipalAffiliations as pa, tblPrincipal
      where principalID = 7 and affiliationID = prinID

Use the following example to get a list of every chat room that a user, Jane Dow, is a direct member of.

    SELECT DISTINCT nodeName as ChatRoom, prinName as Name          
      FROM tblPrincipalRole, tblPrincipal, tblNode
      WHERE  prinRoleNodeID = nodeID AND prinRolePrinID = prinID AND prinName = 'Jane Dow'

          ,invID   
          ,createdOn
      FROM tblPrincipalInvites as inv, tblPrincipal as p, tblNode as n
      where inv.prinID = 5 AND inv.prinID = p.prinID and inv.nodeID = n.nodeID
      ORDER BY invID DESC
