System Center Operations Manager agents running in a perimeter network (such as a Lync Server Edge Server), outside of the enterprise (such as an external synthetic transaction watcher node), or across an Active Directory Domain Services trust boundary, might require the configuration of a System Center Operations Manager Gateway Server. This server role allows agents that do not have a trust relationship with the Root Management Server to raise alerts. For details, see "Managing Gateway Servers in Operations Manager 2007" in the System Center Operations Manager TechNet Library at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268703](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=268703).

If you deploy an agent in one of these locations, you will also need to request and configure a certificate that enables the watcher node to send alerts to System Center Operations Manager. To simplify this process, the Operations Manager team has created a set of utilities that enable you to request and install the correct type of certificate on the watcher node computer. For details, and to download these utilities, see the "Obtaining Certificates for Non-Domain Joined Agents Made Easy With Certificate Generation Wizard" blog article at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=267421](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=267421).
