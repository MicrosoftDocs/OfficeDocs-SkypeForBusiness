Use the following checklist to verify that you have completed all the necessary configuration tasks to deploy call admission control (CAC).

  - If one or more Edge Servers are deployed, each external interface IP address must be added to the subnet list in the network configuration settings, with a bit mask of 32. You should also associate this subnet (IP address) with the network site ID for the geographic location where the A/V Edge service is deployed.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Edge servers are not required to implement CAC.

  - Make sure that CAC is enabled, either through Lync Server Control Panel or by running the cmdlet as specified in [Enable call admission control in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-enable-call-admission-control.md).

  - Make sure that CAC is enabled in all central sites. This can be done through the Topology Builder. If a warning is generated when you publish, *do not* ignore it.

  - Make sure that all the subnets that are managed in the enterprise network are configured in the network configuration settings. It is also essential that every subnet be associated to a network site, as explained in [Associate a subnet with a network site in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-associate-a-subnet-with-a-network-site.md).

  - Make sure that the subnet or IP addresses of all Front End Servers, Survivable Branch Appliances (SBAs), Audio/Video Conferencing Servers (if in a separate pool), and Mediation Servers are configured in the network configuration settings.
