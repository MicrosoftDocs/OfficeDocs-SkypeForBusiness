# DNS summary - Single consolidated edge with private IP addresses using NAT in Lync Server 2013

</div>

_**Topic Last Modified:** 2017-03-09_

DNS record requirements for remote access to Lync Server 2013 are fairly straightforward compared to those for certificates and ports. Also, many records are optional, depending on how you configure clients running Lync 2013 and whether you enable federation.

For details about Lync 2013 DNS requirements, see [Determine DNS requirements for Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-determine-dns-requirements.md).

For details about automatic configuration of clients running Lync 2013 if split-brain DNS is not configured, see “Automatic Configuration without Split-Brain DNS” in [Determine DNS requirements for Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-determine-dns-requirements.md).

The following table contains a summary of the DNS records that are required to support the single consolidated edge topology shown in the Single Consolidated Edge Topology figure. Note that certain DNS records are required only for automatic configuration of Lync 2013 and Lync 2010 clients. If you plan to use group policy objects (GPOs) to configure Lync clients, the associated automatic configuration records are not necessary.

<div>

## IMPORTANT: Edge Server Network Adapter Requirements

To avoid routing issues, verify that there are at least two network adapters in your Edge Servers and that the default gateway is set only on the network adapter associated with the external interface. For example, as shown in the Single Consolidated Edge Topology figure in [Single consolidated edge with private IP addresses and NAT in Lync Server 2013](lync-server-2013-single-consolidated-edge-with-private-ip-addresses-and-nat.md), the default gateway would point to the external firewall (10.45.16.1).

You can configure two network adapters in your Edge Server as follows:

  - **Network adapter 1 (Internal Interface)**
    
    Internal interface with 172.25.33.10 assigned.
    
    No default gateway is defined.
    
    Ensure that there is a route from the network containing the Edge internal interface to any networks that contain servers running Lync Server 2013 or Lync Server 2013 clients (for example, from 172.25.33.0 to 192.168.10.0).

  - **Network adapter 2 (External Interface)**
    
    Three private IP addresses are assigned to this network adapter, for example 10.45.16.10 for Access Edge, 10.45.16.20 for Web Conferencing Edge, 10.45.16.30 for AV Edge
    
    <div>
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > It is possible, though not recommended, to use a single IP address for all three Edge service interfaces. Though this does save IP addresses, it requires different port numbers for each service. The default port number is 443/TCP, which ensures that most remote firewalls will allow the traffic. Changing the port values to (for example) 5061/TCP for the Access Edge, 444/TCP for the Web Conferencing Edge and 443/TCP for the AV Edge might cause problems for remote users where a firewall that they are behind does not allow the traffic over 5061/TCP and 444/TCP. Additionally, three distinct IP addresses makes troubleshooting easier due to being able to filter on IP address.

    
    </div>
    
    Access Edge IP address is primary with default gateway set to integrated router (10.45.16.1).
    
    Web conferencing and A/V Edge IP addresses secondary.

<div>


> [!TIP]
> Configuring the Edge Server with two network adapters is one of two options. The other option is to use one network adapter for the internal side and three network adapters for the external side of the Edge Server. The main benefit of this option is a distinct network adapter per Edge Server service, and potentially more concise data collection when troubleshooting is necessary

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The records listed in the previous table are shown with either a <EM>.net</EM> extension or a <EM>.com</EM> extension to highlight which zone they need to reside in if you are not using split-brain DNS. If you are using split-brain DNS, all records would be in the same <EM>.com</EM> zone, with the only distinction being whether they are in the internal or external DNS zone version.
