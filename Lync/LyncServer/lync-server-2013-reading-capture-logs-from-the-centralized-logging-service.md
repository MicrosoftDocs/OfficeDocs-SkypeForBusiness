You realize the real benefit of the Centralized Logging Service after you run the search and you have a file that you can use to track down a reported problem. There are a number of ways that you can read the file. The output file is in a standard text format and you can use Notepad.exe or any other programs that will allow you to open and read a text file. For larger files and more complex issues, you could use a tool like Snooper.exe that is designed to read and parse the logging output from the Centralized Logging Service. Snooper is included with the Lync Server 2013 Debug Tools that are available as a separate download. You can download the Lync Server 2013 Debug Tools here: [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=285257](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=285257). When you install the Lync Server 2013 Debug Tools, short cuts and menu items are not created. After you install the Lync Server 2013 Debug Tools, open Windows Explorer, a command-line window, or Lync Server Management Shell and go to the directory (default location) C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Lync Server 2013\\Debugging Tools. Double-click Snooper.exe or type Snooper.exe, and then press ENTER if you are using the command line or Lync Server Management Shell.

> The intent of this topic is not to detail and discuss troubleshooting techniques. Troubleshooting and the processes around it is a complex subject. For details about troubleshooting basics and troubleshooting specific workloads, see the Microsoft Lync Server 2010 Resource Kit book at <A href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=211003">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=211003</A>. The processes and procedures still apply to Lync Server 2013.

Lync Server 2013 introduces an updated version of Snooper that includes some new features. The following screen shot shows the version of Snooper from Office Communications Server 2007.

And, the newest feature that adds value is the Flow Chart (call flow) diagram view. You select a message flow in the **Message** tab and click the **Call Flow** button. As you proceed through the messages, the call flow diagram updates with new data.

You can hover over the diagram view and get details about the messages and content of the flows and messages as well as the server elements. Click on any call flow arrow to go to the message in the Messages view.

1.  To use Snooper and open log files, you need read access to the log files. To use Snooper and access the log files you must be a member of the CsAdministrator or the CsServerAdministrator role-based access control (RBAC) security groups, or a custom RBAC role that contains either of these two groups.

2.  After the installation of the Lync Server Debugging Tools (LyncDebugTools.msi), change directory to the location of Snooper.exe using Windows Explorer or from the command line. By default, the debugging tools are located in C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Lync Server 2013\\Debugging Tools. Double-click or run Snooper.exe.

3.  After Snooper is open, right-click **File**, click **OpenFile**, find your log files, select a file in the **Open** dialog box, and then click **Open**.
