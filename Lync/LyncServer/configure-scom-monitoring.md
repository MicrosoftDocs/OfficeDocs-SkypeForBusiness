After migrating to Microsoft Lync Server 2013, you must complete a few tasks to configure Lync Server 2013 to work with System Center Operations Manager.

  - Apply Lync Server 2010 updates to a server elected to manage the central discovery logic.

  - Update the central discovery candidate server registry key.

  - Configure your primary System Center Operations Manager management server to override the candidate central discovery node.

Instructions for carrying out each of these tasks are provided below.

**Apply Lync Server 2010 updates to a server elected to manage the central discovery logic.**

1.  Elect a server that has the System Center Operations Manager agent files installed and is configured as a candidate discovery node.

2.  Apply Lync Server 2010 updates to this server. See the topic [Apply Lync Server 2010 updates](apply-lync-server-2010-updates.md).

**Update the central discovery candidate server registry key.**

1.  On the server elected to manage the central discovery logic, open a Windows PowerShell command window.

2.  At the command line, type the following:
    
       ```
        New-Item -Path "HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Real-Time Communications\Health"
       ```
    
       ```
        New-Item -Path "HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Real-Time Communications\Health\CentralDiscoveryCandidate"
       ```
    
    <div class="">
    

    > [!NOTE]  
    > Whenever you edit the registry, you may experience an error that the command failed if the registry key already exists. If you experience this, you can safely ignore the error.

    
    </div>

**Configure your primary System Center Operations Manager management server to override the candidate central discovery watcher node.**

1.  On a computer where the System Center Operations Manager console has been installed, expand **Management Pack Objects** and then select **Object Discoveries**.

2.  Click **Change Scope...**

3.  From the **Scope Management Pack Objects** page, select **LS Discovery Candidate**.

4.  Override the **LS Discovery Candidate Effective Value** to the name of the candidate server elected in the earlier procedure.

Lastly, to finalize your changes, restart the health service on the System Center Operations Manager Root Management Server.
