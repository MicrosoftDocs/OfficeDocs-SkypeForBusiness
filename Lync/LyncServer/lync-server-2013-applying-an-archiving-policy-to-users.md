If a user has been enabled for Lync Server 2013 and you have created one or more user policies for archiving for users homed on Lync Server 2013, you can implement archiving support for specific users by applying the appropriate policies to those users or user groups. For example, if you create a policy to support archiving of internal communications, you can apply it to at least one user or user group to support archiving of the user’s Lync Server 2013 communications.

<div>


> [!NOTE]  
> If you enabled Microsoft Exchange integration for your deployment, Exchange In-Place Hold policies control whether archiving is enabled for the users who are homed on Exchange 2013 and have their mailboxes put on In-Place Hold. For details, see <A href="lync-server-2013-setting-up-policies-for-archiving-when-using-exchange-server-integration.md">Setting up policies for Archiving in Lync Server 2013 when using Exchange Server integration</A> in the Deployment documentation.<BR>You should specify all appropriate options in the Archiving configurations before enabling Archiving. For details, see <A href="lync-server-2013-managing-archiving-configuration-options-for-your-organization-sites-and-pools.md">Managing Archiving configuration options in Lync Server 2013 for your organization, sites, and pools</A> in the Operations documentation.



</div>

Use the procedure in this topic to apply a previously created Archiving user policy to one or more user accounts or user groups.

<div>

## To apply an archiving user policy to a user account

1.  From a user account that is assigned to the CsArchivingAdministrator or CsAdministrator role, log on to any computer in your internal deployment.

2.  Open a browser window, and then enter the Admin URL to open the Lync Server Control Panel. For details about the different methods you can use to start Lync Server Control Panel, see [Open Lync Server 2013 administrative tools](lync-server-2013-open-lync-server-administrative-tools.md).

3.  In the left navigation bar, click **Users**, and then search for the user account that you want to configure.

4.  In the table that lists the search results, click the user account, click **Edit**, and then click **Show details**.

5.  In **Edit Lync Server User** under **Archiving policy**, select the archiving user policy that you want to apply.
    
    <div>
    

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The <STRONG>&lt;Automatic&gt;</STRONG> settings apply the default server installation settings. These settings are applied automatically by the server.

    
    </div>

6.  Click **Commit**.

## Assigning a Per-User Archiving Policy by Using Windows PowerShell Cmdlets

Per-user archiving policies can be assigned by using Windows PowerShell and the **Grant-CsArchivingPolicy** cmdlet. You can run this cmdlet from either the Lync Server 2013 Management Shell or from a remote session of Windows PowerShell. For details about using remote Windows PowerShell to connect to Lync Server, see the Lync Server Windows PowerShell blog article "Quick Start: Managing Microsoft Lync Server 2010 Using Remote PowerShell" at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=255876](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=255876).

<div>

## To assign a per-user archiving policy to a single user

  - The following command assigns the per-user archiving policy RedmondArchivingPolicy to the user Ken Myer.
    
        Grant-CsArchivingPolicy -Identity "Ken Myer" -PolicyName "RedmondArchivingPolicy"

</div>

<div>

## To assign a per-user archiving policy to multiple users

  - This command assigns the per-user archiving policy RedmondArchivingPolicy to all users who have accounts homed on the Registrar pool atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com. For details about the Filter parameter used in this command, see the [Get-CsUser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/skype/Get-CsUser) cmdlet documentation.
    
        Get-CsUser -Filter {RegistrarPool -eq "atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com"} | Grant-CsArchivingPolicy -PolicyName "RedmondArchivingPolicy"

</div>

<div>

## To assign a per-user archiving policy

  - The following command unassigns any per-user archiving policy previously assigned to Ken Myer. After the per-user policy is unassigned, Ken Myer will automatically be managed by using the global policy or, if one exists, his local site policy. A site policy takes precedence over the global policy.
    
        Grant-CsArchivingPolicy -Identity "Ken Myer" -PolicyName $Null

</div>

For details, see the [Grant-CsArchivingPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/skype/Grant-CsArchivingPolicy) cmdlet documentation.
