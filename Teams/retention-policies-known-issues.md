# Known issues for retention policies in Microsoft Teams

The following are known issues for retention policies in Teams that are being tracked and investigated.

- Under Choose Teams in the Teams Channel messages location row, you may see Office 365 Groups that are not also Teams. This will be addressed in the future.

- Under Choose Users in the Teams Chat location row, you may see guests and non-mailbox users. Retention policies are not meant to be set for guests, and we are working to remove these from the list.

- Exchange Life Cycle assistant (ELC) runs daily, but it has an SLA of 7 days. As a result, it's possible that, if you have a Teams retention policy to delete items older than 60 days, these items could persist for up to 67 days. This isn't a new situation - it follows the Exchange model. Of course, in most cases, there is no delay.
