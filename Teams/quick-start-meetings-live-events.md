# Meetings, webinars, and live events

There are multiple ways to meet in Microsoft Teams: meetings, webinars, and live events.

This article, intended for administrators and IT Pros, describes the differences between meetings, webinars, and live events. It then provides links to the information you need to quickly roll out this functionality for your users.

> [!NOTE]
> For details about quickly configuring Teams meetings and events on different platforms, see [Teams features by platform](https://support.microsoft.com/office/teams-features-by-platform-debe7ff4-7db4-4138-b7d0-fcc276f392d3).

[Meetings](#meetings), [webinars](#webinars), and [live events](#live-events) are all types of meetings, but webinars and live events provide additional control for the organizer over the conversation and participants. Webinars provide two-way interaction while live events provide a managed Q&A experience. 

The different types of meetings also have different participant limits and participant capabilities. 

The following table summarizes the three types of meetings, the number of recommended participants, and how participants can interact in the meeting. Sections with more information about each type of meeting follow the table. This article also includes a section on [best practices for large meetings](#best-practices-for-large-meetings).

| Type of meeting | Number of participants | Interaction | Registration supported |
|----------|--------|--------|-----|
| Meetings  | Up to 20,000* | - Participants up to 1,000 have fully interactive equal meeting capabilities. <br> - Participants over 1,000 up to 20,000 have [View-only](view-only-meeting-experience.md) capabilities.  | No |
| Webinars | - Up to 1,000<br>- Increased limits with [View-only](view-only-meeting-experience.md) capabilities coming soon. |- Participants up to 1,000 have fully interactive capabilities.<br> - Audience interaction configurable.<br> - Can specify presenters. | Yes |
| Live events | Up to 20,000** |- Broadcast to large audiences. <br>- Moderated Q&A for audience interaction. <br> - Can specify producers and presenters, including external presenters.<br>- Supports more advanced production capabilities. | No |

*The usual 10,000 is increased to 20,000 through December 31, 2022.

**The usual 10,000 is increased to 20,000 through December 31, 2022. You can schedule even greater numbers with live events in Yammer and/or Microsoft Stream. For more information, see [Live events across Microsoft 365](/stream/live-event-m365). Note that events over 20,000 attendees require the [Live Events Assistance Program](/stream/live-events-assistance).

Note that NDI is fully supported in meetings, webinars, and live events, allowing you to produce the broadcast by using tools such as OBS and Wirecast. For more information, see [Use NDI® technology in Microsoft Teams](use-ndi-in-meetings.md).

## Meetings

**Meetings** in Teams include audio, video, and screen sharing for up to 1,000 people and [view-only capabilities](view-only-meeting-experience.md) for participants over 1,000. Participants don't need to be a member of an organization (or have a Teams account) to join a Teams meeting. They can join directly from the calendar invitation via the Join meeting link or call in via audio if available.  

As the administrator, you'll configure meeting settings and control which meeting features are enabled for your organization by specifying meeting policies.  

In addition to regularly scheduled meetings, your users can create channel meetings. With channel meetings, everybody in a team can see there is a meeting, join the meeting, and use the meeting chat. Channel meetings are a way to quickly invite everyone in a team to a meeting. For more information about how end users schedule meetings, see [Schedule a meeting](https://support.microsoft.com/office/schedule-a-meeting-in-teams-943507a9-8583-4c58-b5d2-8ec8265e04e5).

For information about the view-only meeting experience, see [Teams view-only meeting experience](view-only-meeting-experience.md).

## Apps for meetings

Microsoft enables you to enhance meeting experiences by integrating and using meeting apps. For example, whiteboard integration in Teams meetings is powered by the Whiteboard web app, which lets Teams meeting participants draw, sketch, and write together on a shared digital canvas.

You can add meetings apps to your Teams deployment by using the apps provided with Teams,  using certified third-party apps and templates, and creating your own custom apps.

The following table lists articles for more information:

## License requirements for meetings, webinars, and live events

Anyone can attend a Teams meeting, webinar, or Public Live Event for free—no license is required.

For the people who organize, schedule, and host meetings, webinars, or live events, they'll need one of the Microsoft 365 licenses listed in the [Microsoft Teams service description](/office365/servicedescriptions/teams-service-description). If you're already using Teams, you probably have the license you need for organizing and hosting meetings, webinars, and live events.

To allow people to dial in to a meeting by phone, you'll need to set up audio conferencing. For more information about audio conferencing, see [Audio conferencing in Teams](deploy-audio-conferencing-teams-landing-page.md).

## Best practices for large meetings

This section provides guidance for administrators, along with tips that administrators can share with their presenters and organizers.

To run a successful event, follow the practices outlined below:

- For the best experience in large meetings, webinars, and live events, Microsoft recommends using the latest version of the Teams desktop client or Teams mobile clients.

- Ensure that all Microsoft [Network Connectivity Principles](/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-network-connectivity-principles) have been followed both on-premises and for remote users.
- Use [real-time data telemetry](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/introducing-microsoft-teams-real-time-call-quality-analytics/ba-p/2912146) to monitor the event and identify any possible issues and its source.
  - Designate meeting monitors to [analyze](use-real-time-telemetry-to-troubleshoot-poor-meeting-quality.md) telemetry for users facing poor experience caused by metrics exceeding thresholds.
  - Set meeting monitors as presenters to disable rogue video streams, mute accidental live mics, and remove attendees if needed.

### Guidelines for your end users

Your organizers and presenters should implement the below recommendations:

- For meetings with more than 10 participants, use [Q&A](/MicrosoftTeams/manage-qna-for-teams) to give participants the opportunity to formally ask and receive answers to questions, as well as engage in structured discussions.

- To create a smooth meeting, event organizers can set pre-defined presenters. After a meeting has started, presenters also can promote other attendees to the presenter role.

- Define a co-organizer via meeting options (Public preview)

- Pre-configure video and microphone settings to control attendees’ experiences.
  - Disable attendees’ microphones to avoid disturbances. If someone needs to interact during the meeting, allow them to un-mute when they raise their hand.
  - Disable attendees’ video to avoid visual distractions. During appropriate times in the meeting, video can be permitted for all attendees or specific individuals.

- Use polls and Q&A during the meeting.

- Use lobby controls to control meeting entry or lobby holds.

- Run the [Microsoft 365 network connectivity test](https://connectivity.office.com/) to verify network suitability several days prior to and the day of the event.

- If presenting from home, verify other devices are not consuming high bandwidth (Streaming services, online gaming, large downloads).

- Present from an endpoint with a wired connection for more reliable audio, video, and screen sharing.

- Ensure users are on the latest Teams app on a desktop or mobile device.

- When using a laptop, check for high network connectivity and sufficient power.

- Schedule a dry run prior to the event to identify device, lighting, or network issues. This will also ensure that organizers/presenters are familiar with features they’ll be using.
  - Schedule additional practice runs if issues were encountered to ensure remediation efforts were successful.
  
- Utilize features such as spotlight, PowerPoint Live, meeting recording, captions, and transcriptions to promote engagement and effectiveness.

- Presenters and participants should use the Teams desktop app to provide an optimal experience.

- Participants should turn off chat notifications during large meetings to avoid distractions.

- For more tips on hosting large meetings, see [Best practices for a large Teams meeting](https://support.microsoft.com/office/best-practices-for-a-large-teams-meeting-ce2cdb9a-0546-43a4-bb55-34ab98ab6b16).
