# Quick start - Meetings, webinars, and live events 

There are multiple ways to meet in Microsoft Teams: meetings, webinars, and live events. 

This article, intended for administrators and IT Pros, briefly describes the differences between meetings, webinars, and live events. It then provides links to the information you need to quickly roll out this functionality for your users.

> [!Note]
> For details about quickly configuring Teams meetings and events on different platforms, see [Teams features by platform](https://support.microsoft.com/office/teams-features-by-platform-debe7ff4-7db4-4138-b7d0-fcc276f392d3).

## Meetings, webinars, and live events

[Meetings](#meetings), [webinars](#webinars), and [live events](#live-events) are all types of meetings, but webinars and live events provide additional control for the organizer over the conversation and participants. Webinars provide two-way interaction while live events provide a managed Q&A experience. 

The different types of meetings also have different participant limits and participant capabilities. 

The following table briefly summarizes the three types of meetings, the number of recommended participants, and how participants can interact in the meeting. More information about each type of meeting follow the table.
<br><br>

| Type of meeting | Number of participants | Interaction | Registration supported |
|----------|--------|--------|-----|
| Meetings  | Up to 1,000* <br> | -Participants up to 1,000* have fully interactive equal meeting capabilities.  | No |
| Webinars | Up to 1,000<br> |-Participants up to 1,000 have fully interactive capabilities. <br> -Audience interaction configurable. <br> -Can specify presenters. | Yes |
| Live events | Up to 20,000** |-View-only broadcast to large audiences. <br>-Moderated Q&A for audience interaction. <br> -Can specify producers and presenters, including external presenters.<br>-Supports more advanced production capabilities.<br>-Supports eCDN | No |
||||

\*For Meetings where more than 1,000 attendees join, attendees will join in a View Only Experience ([View-only](view-only-meeting-experience.md)) and up to 10,000** such attendees may join.<br>

**We have temporarily extended the broadcast view-only experience to 20,000 attendees during COVID-19, and this will revert back to the original capacity of 10,000 attendees on December 31, 2020. Note that the [live events assistance program](/stream/live-events-assistance) is available to help you host your next large meeting, webinar, and live event. 

**Considerations for large meetings, webinars, and live events** - When hosting large meetings, consider the following:

- For large events where you anticipate more than 1,000 participants, consider using Teams live events and take advantage of broadcast capabilities. 

- For the best experience in large meetings, webinars, and live events, Microsoft recommends using the latest version of the Teams desktop client or Teams mobile clients. 

- Presenters in large meetings, webinars, and live events should use the Teams desktop client. 

- For more tips on hosting large meetings, see: <br>
  - [Best practices for a large Teams meeting](https://support.microsoft.com/office/best-practices-for-a-large-teams-meeting-ce2cdb9a-0546-43a4-bb55-34ab98ab6b16)
  - [Hosting Teams live events](/microsoftteams/teams-live-events/what-are-teams-live-events)
  - [Hosting webinars](/microsoftteams/set-up-webinars)

Note that NDI is fully supported in meetings, webinars, and live events, allowing you to produce the broadcast by using tools such as OBS and Wirecast. For more information, see [Use NDIÂ® technology in Microsoft Teams](use-ndi-in-meetings.md).


### Meetings

**Meetings** in Teams include audio, video, and screen sharing for up to 1,000 people. A [view-only experience](view-only-meeting-experience.md) for participants can be enabled for more than 1,000 participants if you are uncertain if more than 1,000 participants will join. Participants don't need to be a member of an organization (or have a Teams account) to join a Teams meeting. They can join directly from the calendar invitation via the **Join meeting** link or call in via audio if available.  

As the administrator, you'll configure meeting settings and control which meeting features are enabled for your organization by specifying meeting policies.  

In addition to regularly scheduled meetings, your users can create channel meetings. With channel meetings, everybody in a team can see there is a meeting, join the meeting, and use the meeting chat. Channel meetings are a way to quickly invite everyone in a team to a meeting. For more information about how end users schedule meetings, see [Schedule a meeting](https://support.microsoft.com/office/schedule-a-meeting-in-teams-943507a9-8583-4c58-b5d2-8ec8265e04e5).

To produce larger scale virtual events, review the [Virtual Event Guide](https://adoption.microsoft.com/virtual-event-guidance/), which has guidance for event organizers, technical producers, IT professionals, and content creators. 

## Apps for meetings

Microsoft enables you to enhance meeting experiences by integrating and using meeting apps. For example, whiteboard integration in Teams meetings is powered by the Whiteboard web app, which lets Teams meeting participants draw, sketch, and write together on a shared digital canvas.

You can add meetings apps to your Teams deployment by using the apps provided with Teams,  using certified third-party apps and templates, and creating your own custom apps.

## License requirements for meetings, webinars, and live events

Anyone can attend a Teams meeting, webinar, or live event for free&mdash;no license is required. 

For the people who organize, schedule, and host meetings, webinars, or live events, they'll need one of the Microsoft 365 licenses listed in the [Microsoft Teams service description](/office365/servicedescriptions/teams-service-description). If you're already using Teams, you probably have the license you need for organizing and hosting meetings, webinars, and live events.

To allow people to dial in to a meeting by phone, you'll need to set up audio conferencing. For more information about audio conferencing, see [Audio conferencing in Teams](deploy-audio-conferencing-teams-landing-page.md).
