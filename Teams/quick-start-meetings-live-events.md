# Admin quick start - Meetings and live events in Microsoft Teams

There are 2 ways to meet in Microsoft Teams - meetings and live events. Use this article to quickly roll out and configure meetings and live events for your organization. 

 - **Meetings** in Teams include audio, video, and screen sharing for up to 250 people. They're one of the key ways to collaborate in Teams. And you don't need to be a member of an organization (or even have a Teams account!) to join a Teams meeting—just look in the invitation for instructions about calling in. 

 - **Live events** are an extension of Teams meetings that enable you to schedule and produce events that stream to large online audiences - up to 10,000 people. If you need a meeting for more than 250 people, use a live event.

## Get licenses for meetings and live events

Anyone can attend a Teams meeting or live event for free - no license is required. Attendees join a Teams meeting or live event by clicking the **Join** button in Teams or the meeting invitation. Meeting audio is part of a Teams meeting, but if you want people to be able to dial in to a meeting by phone, you'll need to provide a dial-in number. 

For the people who will organize, schedule, and host meetings or live events, they'll need one of the Microsoft 365 or Office 365 licenses listed in the table below. If you're already using Teams, you probably have the license you need for organizing and hosting meetings and live events. 

:::image type="content" source="media/quick-start-meetings-live-events-image1.png" alt-text="Table with licenses required for Teams meetings or live events":::

> <sup>1</sup>  Meeting organizers need to have an [Audio Conferencing add-on license](teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md) to send an invite that includes dial-in conferencing.
>
> <sup>2</sup>  Meeting dial out to a [**Call me at** number](set-up-the-call-me-feature-for-your-users.md) requires organizers to have an E5 or [Audio Conference add-in license](teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md). A [dial plan](what-are-dial-plans.md) may also be needed. 


To learn more about licensing, read [Office 365 licensing for Teams](Office-365-licensing.md). 

## Make sure your network's ready

If you already prepared your network when you rolled out Microsoft 365 or Office 365, you're probably all set. In any case - and especially if you're rolling out Teams quickly as your first Office 365 workload to support **remote workers** - read [Prepare your organization's network for Teams](prepare-network.md) to be sure you're ready.

## Meetings and conferencing

- As the admin, you'll configure [meeting settings](meeting-settings-in-teams.md) for everyone. Then you'll use [meeting policies](meeting-policies-in-teams.md) to control what meeting features are (and aren't) available for your users. 

- To learn about managing meeting recording, read [Teams cloud meeting recording](cloud-recording.md).

- If your users are new to Teams meetings, share the [Manage meetings](https://support.office.com/article/join-a-teams-meeting-078e9868-f1aa-4414-8bb9-ee88e9236ee4) training with them. Check out our instructor-led online class, [Run effective meetings with Teams](https://microsoftteams.eventbuilder.com/MaximizingTeamsMeetings).

- To learn about managing meeting options, read [Change participant settings for a Teams meeting](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/change-participant-settings-for-a-teams-meeting-53261366-dbd5-45f9-aae9-a70e6354f88e?ui=en-us&rs=en-gb&ad=gb).

- Don't forget about [managing your users' devices](device-management.md) - phones, headsets, cameras. To get the latest and up-to-date information on Teams certified devices, go to [Teams devices](https://office.com/teamsdevices).

## Live events

- Similar to meetings, you - the admin - [configure live events](teams-live-events/configure-teams-live-events.md) for everyone. Then set up (and assign) [live event policies](teams-live-events/set-up-for-teams-live-events.md) to control what your users can (and can't) do.

- Make sure your live event producers and organizers are trained - send them to [Get started with live events](https://support.office.com/article/get-started-with-microsoft-teams-live-events-d077fec2-a058-483e-9ab5-1494afda578a).

- If you're new to live events, check out [What are Teams live events?](teams-live-events/what-are-teams-live-events.md) and [Plan for Teams live events](teams-live-events/plan-for-teams-live-events.md).
