## What is the new Teams?

The new Microsoft Teams desktop client for Windows has been re-imagined from the ground up with a performance in mind providing a faster, simpler, and more flexible experience. With new Teams, the client installs and loads faster, letting you launch the app and join meetings more quickly, giving you more time to focus on the business tasks. 

New Teams ensures more efficient use of device resources. You can lower memory and disk usage with a Teams app optimized for your device. Whether you have users on multiple accounts or tenants, the new Teams can help eliminate the silos and bring them together in one place, giving them more extensibility and scale.

## How to roll out new Teams

As an admin, you can manage which users in your organizations see or don't see the "Try the new Teams" toggle to use the new Teams.

:::image type="content" source="media/new-teams-toggle.png" alt-text="new teams try me toggle at the top of the screen":::

To control which users can see the toggle, use the Teams admin setting **UseNewTeamsClient** under the **TeamsUpdateManagement** policy. 

Manage this setting in the **Teams admin center** or using **Teams PowerShell**.</br>

# [**Teams Admin Center**](#tab/teams-admin-center)

Configure setting via Teams Admin Center

In addition to PowerShell, you can also use Teams Admin Center to manage the visibility of the toggle on a per-user basis.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com).
2. Select **Teams > Teams Update** policies from the left pane, as shown below.

   :::image type="content" source="media/new-teams-update-policies-toggle.png" alt-text="step in how to update teams policies":::

3. Select Add to create a new policy or select an existing policy to open Update policy.
4. Name the update policy, add a description, and select the setting for “Use new Teams client”, as shown below.

   |Setting|Description|
   |:-----|:-----|
   |Microsoft controlled| Default. The value lets Microsoft control whether the new Teams toggle switch is shown or not based on product readiness|
   |User can choose| Use this value to show the new Teams toggle switch, to let users opt into the new Teams, and switch back if they need to.|
   |Not enabled|Use this value to hide the new Teams toggle switch. Users won't be able to opt in to the new Teams.|

   :::image type="content" source="media/new-teams-update-policies-toggle2.png" alt-text="naming the update policy and the setting." lightbox="media/new-teams-update-policies-toggle2.png":::

5. Once the policy is defined, you can assign it to a specific user or users groups by selecting the **Policy name > Assign users > Manage users**. Enter the user to add and select apply.

   :::image type="content" source="media/new-teams-update-policies-toggle3.png" alt-text="next step in enabling the toggle switch" lightbox="media/new-teams-update-policies-toggle3.png":::

6. Once the policy is defined, you can assign it to a specific user under **Users> Manage users**.

   If you update the policy setting in the Teams Admin Center, the new setting goes into effect within one minute. The user doesn't have to restart the app.

# [**Powershell**](#tab/powershell)

Configure the UseNewTeamsClient setting to one of the following possible values:

| Setting | Explanation |
| :----- | :----- |
| MicrosoftChoice | Default setting. This value lets Microsoft control if the Teams (preview) toggle switch is shown based on product readiness. |
| UserChoice | This value lets the new Teams toggle switch display to all users. Users can choose to opt in or out.|
| AdminDisabled | This value hides the new Teams toggle switch from view. Users won't be able to opt in to the new Teams.| 

Here are the steps needed to configure this setting in PowerShell:

1. Import the latest Teams PowerShell cmdlets (require version 4.9.1 or greater) by following [Manage Teams with Microsoft Teams PowerShell](/microsoftteams/teams-powershell-managing-teams) instructions. Direct link: [PowerShell Gallery Microsoft Teams 4.9.1](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MicrosoftTeams/4.9.1).
1. Connect to an admin account using this command:

```powershell
Connect-MicrosoftTeams
```

3. Once connected and logged in via PowerShell, you can explore the list of related commands:
Enter *-CsTeamsUpdateManagementPolicy and tab through the commands (tab key).

4. Use the following commands to change the existing Update Management policy to opt in the assigned users to allow them to try the new Teams:

```powershell
Set-CsTeamsUpdateManagementPolicy -identity <new_policy_name> -UseNewTeamsClient 
```

UserChoice

Example:
```powershell 

Set-CsTeamsUpdateManagementPolicy -identity MySetting -UseNewTeamsClient UserChoice

```

   > [!NOTE]
   > This method (existing policy modification) doesn't take effect immediately; allow up to 24 hours for the change to propagate to users. Users don't need to restart the app, but specifically for opt-in, they'll need one restart following a fresh install to see the toggle.

5. Use the following commands to deploy a new policy to opt-out a specific user from seeing the toggle:

```powershell

New-CsTeamsUpdateManagementPolicy -identity <new_policy_name> -UseNewTeamsClient AdminDisabled

Grant-CsTeamsUpdateManagementPolicy -identity <user> -PolicyName <new_policy_name>

```

**Example:**

```powershell
New-CsTeamsUpdateManagementPolicy -identity MySetting -UseNewTeamsClient AdminDisabled
Grant-CsTeamsUpdateManagementPolicy -identity admin@contoso.org -PolicyName MySetting
```

  > [!NOTE]
  > This new policy assignment method should take effect within one minute. Users don't need to restart the app.

---

### How to uninstall the new Teams client

Any user who was using the new Teams before the policy was implemented can manually opt out by using the new Teams toggle. 

After they opt out, the toggle won't appear when they relaunch Teams. To prevent users from using this client and want to uninstall the client, users can manually uninstall it from settings.

</br>

### Remove new Teams for all users

To remove the new Teams from all users' computers, use the following PowerShell command:

```powershell

Remove-AppxPackage 
```

PowerShell cmdlet to remove new Teams from all users on all computers:

Get-AppxPackage *MSTeams* -AllUsers |Remove-AppxPackage -AllUsers
For an individual user without administrator privilege, use this command:
Get-AppxPackage *MSTeams*|Remove-AppxPackage

</br>

## Installation issues

#### Policy settings restricting download & install

If your users are experiencing issues installing the app, as an administrator you may have set some restrictions preventing them from downloading and installing it. They may see this error: 

:::image type="content" source="media/new-teams-install-error.png" alt-text="error when attempting to install the new teams desktop client":::

It's possible that the MSIX package installation could be blocked by registry keys set by GPO policy/third party tool. For a complete list of registry keys: [How Group Policy works with packaged apps - MSIX](/windows/msix/group-policy-msix)

The registry keys that could block new Teams MSIX package installation are: 
 
- *BlockNonAdminUserInstall*
- *AllowAllTrustedApps*
- *AllowDevelopmentWithoutDevLicense*

</br>

These registry keys can be found at one of these locations:
  - Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppModelUnlock
  - Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Appx

</br>
There are a few policies that could alter these registry keys and block app installation in your organization due to restricted policy set by the admins. Some of the known GPO policies that may be preventing installation include:

- Prevent non-admins users from installing packaged Windows apps
- Allow all trusted apps to install (disabled)

#### To check this setting for your computer

1. In Windows, search for **Edit Group Policy**.
2. This will open the Local Group Policy Editor screen.
3. Go to **Computer Configuration > Windows Components > App package Deployment** to check settings for these policies: 
  - *Prevent non-admins users from installing packaged Windows apps*
  - *Allow all trusted apps to install*
4. Make sure that value for these settings is set as follows:

|Setting |Value|
|:-----|:-----|
|Prevent non-admins users from installing packaged Windows apps|Not configured|
|Allow all trusted apps to install|Not configured|

</br>

#### Troubleshooting the App switcher toggle

- Relaunch your current client before turning the *Try the new Teams* toggle ON to make sure that you have latest changes. Also, if there's any Windows update pending, including security updates, install them before you try new Teams.
- If you’re not seeing the toggle for new Teams, make sure you have the minimum required versions for Windows and Teams
- After you successfully switch to new Teams, if you can't find the toggle on the top left to switch between new Teams and Microsoft Teams (work or school), you can start the version you want by going to Start menu and searching for it or by clicking on it from the task bar. 


#### Policies that could block the user from seeing the App switcher toggle

The following list of policies can block users from seeing the app switcher toggle.

- If the user is on a VDI computer (Citrix, VMware etc.). 
- If the user is signed in to classic Teams with a *Teams for Life* account and a work account. 
- If the user is signed in to classic Teams with a *Teams for Life* account.
- If you have an MSIX client. 
- [Learn more about how to restrict Teams sign in on desktop devices](/microsoftteams/sign-in-teams#how-to-restrict-teams-sign-in-on-desktop-devices) 

##### How do I know which one of the above policies is blocking me?

1. Open logs in this path: %appdata%/Microsoft/Teams 
1. Open logs.txt 
1. Search for **appswitcher_appstateservice_check**.
1. Check the **enggComplete** flag:  
   - If true, the Microsoft has turned the setting for you. 
   - If false, you didn’t the settings from MSFT yet or need an app relaunch (see below for steps to relaunch the app) 
1. Check **isAboveWin10Vibranium**.
   - If true, the OS version is >= what is needed for app switcher  
   - If false, the OS is older than what we support. 
1. Check the code to find out the cause.

|Code|Meaning|
|:-----|:-----|
|TFLONLY|You're only signed in to *Teams for Life*|
|TFLANDTFW| You're signed in to *Teams for Life* and *Teams for Work*|
|SPECIALCLOUD| You're signed in to a special cloud that isn’t supported.|
|CROSSCLOUD| You're signed in to a government cloud.| 
|VDI|You're signed in to a VDI machine (VMware, Citrix, AVD/WV).|
|SIGNINRESTRICTED|You're signed in to the allowed tenant but the App switcher toggle does not appear.|


#### Update and restart message in title bar

Issue: After opting into the new Teams, users may receive an “Update and restart” message in the title bar.
Action: This is expected behavior. Select the link to restart.

#### Windows 10 users may receive an error message

Issue: Windows 10 users may receive the error “We’ve run into an issue” when they download and install the new Teams.</br>
Action: [Download and install WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section). Then restart the Teams desktop app and try again.

#### Some people don't see the toggle to opt in

Make sure the user has the minimum requirements met on their computer.  Next, have them sign out and back into the Teams desktop app.  
If the toggle still doesn't appear, then 

1. Right-click on the Teams app icon in your taskbar and select Quit.
1. Open File Explorer. In the address bar, enter the following: `%appdata%/Microsoft/Teams`.
1. Select the arrow, or press Enter. You’ll be taken to the contents of that folder.
1. Delete all contents of the folder (don’t worry, Teams app won't be deleted, and no or on any of your custom settings). If you get any messages that a certain file or folder can’t be deleted, select Skip.
1. Relaunch the Teams app, then right-click on the icon and select Quit.
1. Relaunch the Teams app one more time, and you should see the toggle switch.


## What features are still missing?

While many of the features you're familiar with in classic Teams are already in the new experience, others, like Breakout rooms, are still being worked on. </br>

[**Follow Microsoft Adoption for the latest information on upcoming features for the new Teams.**](https://aka.ms/newTeams).

## What features are changing?

As we improve the client, the experience has been improved to align with similar features. Here are some of the changes you'll see.

|Classic Teams|New Teams|
|:-----|:-----|
|Purple toast notifications|You'll no longer see the purple "toast" notifications, and the taskbar icon will behave a little different. Notifications will be via Windows native notifications to provide a consistent experience.|
|Adding a Wiki to a channel tab|You'll no longer see a Wiki app. Instead, select the Notes app.|
|Adding third party cloud storage service from Files app|You'll no longer see the "Add cloud storage" in the Files app on Teams' left navigation bar. Now you can add the 3rd party storage app directly from the Teams App Store.|
|Look up an organizational chart while in a 1:1 chat |Select a user’s avatar or profile photo anywhere in Teams and navigate to the organizational chart within the profile card.|
|Look up LinkedIn while in a 1:1 chat | Select a user’s avatar or profile photo anywhere in Teams and navigate to the LinkedIn tab within the profile card.|
|Adding a document library (DocLib) app to a tab in channels|Use the Sharepoint app instead. Then add the document library from there as a tab to the channel. Existing document libraries will automatically convert to a SharePoint document library on first use.|
|Uploading content to a DocLib folder|No need to select a folder, just upload directly to SharePoint. If you want to organize your uploads into a specific folder, go to the channel tab and move the file as needed.|
|Allow users to follow a user's presence and then notify them of availability|No longer available|
|Activity tab in chat| No longer available|
