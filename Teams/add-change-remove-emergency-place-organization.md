# Add, change, or remove a place for an emergency location in your organization

Depending on the number of physical locations in your organization, you can add *places* for buildings, floors, and offices to create a more specific emergency location.

Depending on your PSTN connectivity option, however, how you manage emergency locations and location requirements may vary. For more information, see [Manage emergency calling](what-are-emergency-locations-addresses-and-call-routing.md).

This article describes how to add, change, or remove a *place* for an emergency location for your organization.
