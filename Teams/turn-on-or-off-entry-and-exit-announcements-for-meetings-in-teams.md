# Turn on or off entry and exit announcements for meetings in Microsoft Teams

When you set up Audio Conferencing in Microsoft 365 or Office 365, you provide users with phone numbers through an audio conferencing bridge. This bridge can have one or more phone numbers, which are included at the bottom of the meeting invite. These numbers allow users to join Microsoft Teams meetings by dialing in.

As an admin, you can control whether an entry and exit announcement is played when participants who dialed into the meeting join or leave.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [updating-admin-interfaces](includes/updating-admin-interfaces.md)]
  
## Setting meeting join options using the Microsoft Teams admin center

1. Expand **Meetings** > **Conference Bridges**.

2. At the top of the **Conference Bridges** page, select **Bridge Settings**.

3. In the **Bridge settings** pane, enable or disable **Meeting entry and exit notifications**. This setting is enabled by default. If you disable it, participants in the meeting aren't notified when someone enters or leaves.

4. Under **Entry/exit announcement type**, select **Names or phone numbers** or **Tones**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > By default, external participants can't see the phone numbers of dialed-in participants. If you want to maintain the privacy of these phone numbers, select **Tones** for **Entry/exit announcement type** (this prevents the numbers from being read out by Teams).

5. If you chose **Names or phone numbers**, enable or disable **Ask callers to record their name before joining the meeting**.

6. Select **Save**.

## Turn on or off entry and exit announcements with PowerShell

To turn entry and exit announcements on or off with PowerShell, use the **`-EnableEntryExitNotifications`** parameter within the PowerShell [CsOnlineDialInConferencingTenantSettings](/powershell/module/teams/set-csonlinedialinconferencingtenantsettings) cmdlet.

EnableEntryExitNotifications

### Turn off entry and exit announcements

```

### Turn on entry and exit announcements
