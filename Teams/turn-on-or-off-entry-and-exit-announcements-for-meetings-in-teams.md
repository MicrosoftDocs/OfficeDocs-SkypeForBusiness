# Turn on or off entry and exit announcements for meetings in Microsoft Teams

When you are setting up Audio Conferencing in Office 365, you will get an audio conferencing bridge. A conferencing bridge can contain one or more phone numbers that people will use to call in to a Microsoft Teams meeting. 
  
The conferencing bridge answers a call for a user who is dialing in to a meeting using a phone. The conferencing bridge answers the caller with voice prompts from a conferencing auto attendant, and then, depending on your settings, can play notifications, ask callers to record their name, and set up the PIN security. A PIN is given to a Microsoft Teams meeting organizer, and it allows them to start a meeting if they can't start the meeting using the Microsoft Teams app. You can, however, set it so that a PIN isn't required to start a meeting.

1. In the left navigation, go to **Meetings** > **Conference Bridges**. 

2. At the top of the **Conference Bridges** page, click **Bridge Settings**. 

3. In the **Bridge settings** pane, enable or disable **Meeting entry and exit notifications**. This is selected by default. If you clear it, users who have already joined the meeting won't be notified when someone enters or leaves the meeting.
    
4. Under **Entry/exit announcement type**, select **Names or phone numbers** or **Tones**.
    
5. If you chose **Names or phone numbers**, enable or disable **Ask callers to record their name before joining the meeting**.
    
6. Click **Save**.
