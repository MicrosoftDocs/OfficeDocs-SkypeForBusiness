This article describes how emergency call routing is supported for Microsoft Calling Plans in different countries/regions.

DID - Direct Inward Dialing<br>
EDB - Emergency DataBase<br>
LAC - Location Area Code<br>

| Country  | How emergency calling works | 
| -------------------- | ----------- | 
| Australia | Emergency addresses are configured and routed by the carrier partner.  | 
| Austria | All outbound calls to Emergency Services are routed to the correct PSAP based on the LAC/first digits of the caller’s number. In Austria, there is no national EDB. The PSAPs will contact the operator in case they are not able to get the address from the caller.| 
| Belgium | All outbound calls to Emergency Services are dependent on the address of the caller. The address registered to the number is stored in a national EDB. When a call is made to the PSAP with the CLI, the PSAP system looks up the address against the number and displays it to the PSAP operator.  |
| Canada |  All outbound calls to Emergency Services are first screened to determine the current location of the user before being routed to the local PSAP. |
| Croatia | All outbound calls to Emergency Services are sent to the local PSAP based on the phone number prefix. For non-geo numbers, calls are routed to the national PSAP.  |
| Czech Republic | All outbound calls to Emergency Services are routed to the incumbent Operator, then routed to the East or West Call Centers, and then distributed to the appropriate Emergency Services Provider.  |
| Denmark | All outbound calls to Emergency Services are dependent on the address of the caller. The address registered to the number is stored in a national EDB – when a call is made to the PSAP with the CLI, the Local PSAP system looks up the address against the number and displays it to the PSAP operator.  | 
| Estonia | All outbound calls to Emergency Services are sent to the local PSAP based on the phone number prefix. For non-geo numbers, calls are routed to the national PSAP.  |
