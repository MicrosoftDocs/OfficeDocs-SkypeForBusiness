# Plan for Microsoft 365 Government - GCC deployments

This guidance is for IT pros who are driving deployments of Office 365 in US federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial government entities or other entities that handle data that’s subject to government regulations and requirements, where the use of Microsoft 365 Government - GCC is appropriate to meet these requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> If your organization has already met the Microsoft 365 Government - GCC eligibility requirements and applied for and been accepted into the program, you can skip steps 1 and 2 and go directly to step 3. 

## Step 1. Determine whether your organization needs Microsoft 365 Government - GCC and meets eligibility requirements. 

The Microsoft 365 Government - GCC environment provides compliance with US government requirements for cloud services, including FedRAMP Moderate, and requirements for criminal justice and federal tax information systems (CJI and FTI data types).

In addition to enjoying the features and capabilities of Office 365, organizations benefit from the following features that are unique to Microsoft 365 Government - GCC:

-   Your organization’s customer content is logically segregated from customer content in the commercial Office 365 services from Microsoft.
-   Your organization’s customer content is stored within the United States.
-   Access to your organization’s customer content is restricted to screened Microsoft personnel.
-   Microsoft 365 Government - GCC complies with certifications and accreditations that are required for US Public Sector customers.

You can find more information about the Microsoft 365 Government - GCC offering for US Government customers at [Office 365 Government plans](https://products.office.com/government/compare-office-365-government-plans), including [eligibility requirements](https://products.office.com/government/compare-office-365-government-plans#EligibilityRequirements).

The [Office 365 US Government service description](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt774581.aspx) describes the platform’s benefits, which are centered around meeting compliance requirements within the United States.

> [!Tip]
> You might want to transfer the tables of information in the service description into an Excel workbook and add two columns: **Relevant for my organization Y/N** and **Meets the needs of my organization Y/N**. Then you can review this list with your colleagues to confirm that this service meets your organization’s needs.

## Step 3. Understand Microsoft 365 Government - GCC default security settings.

When you’re ready, deploy Teams to [enable collaboration within your organization through teams and channels](teams-overview.md). Be sure to engage with your Adoption and Change Management team or Teams champions.

## Step 7. Deploy Teams for meetings and voice

This is also a great time to use Teams with your wider stakeholder group to start planning for rolling out meetings and [cloud voice features](cloud-voice-deployment.md).
