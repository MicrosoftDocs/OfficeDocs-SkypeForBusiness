Install Microsoft Teams using MSI (with SCCM)
===========================================

Microsoft has provided an MSI file for admins to bulk deploy Teams to select users or machines. Admins can use this file to remotely deploy Teams so that users do not have to manually download the Teams app. System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) is the primary tool used with MSI files for managed deployments.
