Purchase third-party apps in the Microsoft Teams admin center
======================================================

The [Manage apps page](manage-apps.md) in the Microsoft Teams admin center is where you view and manage all Teams apps in your organization's app catalog. For example, you can see the org-level status and properties of apps, upload new custom apps to your tenant app catalog, block or allow apps at the org level, and manage org-wide app settings.

Here, you can also search for and purchase licenses for third-party apps for users in your organization. The **Licenses** column in the table indicates whether an app offers a Software as a Service (SaaS) subscription for purchase.

You must be a global admin or Teams service admin to access the page.

## Search for and purchase a third-party app

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Teams apps** > **Manage apps**.
2. Search for the app that you want. To identify apps that have a paid SaaS subscription, look in the **Licenses** column. Each app will have one of the following values:
    - **Purchase now**: The app offers a SaaS subscription and is available to purchase.  
    - **Purchased**: The app offers a SaaS subscription and you've purchased licenses for it.
    - **- -**: The app doesn't offer a SaaS subscription.
3. When you find the app, click **Purchase now** to go to the **Plans and pricing** tab of the app details page. Review the plans and pricing information for the app. If you need more information, click the **learn more** link to go to the app's page in [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/).  
4. To select a plan, click **Purchase now**.
5. Choose the plan that you want. By default, the plan that's displayed on this page is the first plan that's listed on the **Plans and pricing** tab. If the app offers more than one plan, click **Change** to see the list of available plans.
6. Enter the number of seats that you want to buy.
7. When you're ready, select **Place order**.
8. Click **Configure now** to activate your subscription on the developer's website.

After you've purchased the app, you can view the purchase details on the **Manage apps** page.

## Have an app that you want to list and sell on AppSource?

Publishing an app to [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) makes it available in the Teams app catalog. If your organization wants to create a SaaS offer for an app to list on AppSource, see [Create a new Saas offer in the commercial marketplace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-new-saas-offer).
