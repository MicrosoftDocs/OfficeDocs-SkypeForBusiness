# Dimensions and measures available in Call Quality Dashboard

The Call Quality Dashboard (CQD) for Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business Online allows you to gain insights into the quality of calls made using Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business services. This topic provides detailed information about the dimensions and measures exposed by CQD. To learn more about CQD and how to enable it, see [Turning on and using Call Quality Dashboard for Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business Online](turning-on-and-using-call-quality-dashboard.md).



## First and Second endpoint classification

Many of the dimensions and measures in Call Quality Dashboard (CQD) are labeled as first or second. The following logic determines which endpoint involved in the stream or call is labeled as first:

- First will always be a Server endpoint (AV MCU, Mediation Server, etc.) if a Server is involved in the stream/call.

- Second will always be a Client endpoint unless the stream is between two Server endpoints.

- If both endpoints are the same type, the order for which is first vs. second is based on internal ordering of the user agent category. This ensures the ordering is consistent.

For example, each row represents a pair of User Agents involved in a stream:

||||||
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**User Agent Category of Caller** <br/> |**User Agent Category of Callee** <br/> |**First Endpoint** <br/> |**Second Endpoint** <br/> |**First Is Caller** <br/> |
|AV-MCU  <br/> |OC (Skype for Business client)  <br/> |AV-MCU  <br/> |OC (Skype for Business client)  <br/> |TRUE  <br/> |

|OC Phone (Skype for Business IP Phone)  <br/> |OC (Skype for Business client)  <br/> |OC (Skype for Business client)  <br/> |OC Phone (Skype for Business IP Phone)  <br/> |FALSE  <br/> |

> [!NOTE]
> That First and Second classification is separate from which endpoint is the caller or callee. The First Is Caller dimension can be used to help identify which endpoint was the caller or callee.

## Dimensions

The following table lists the dimensions currently available in CQD:

### Notes on dimension data type/units:

#### Range

Dimensions that are provided as range or group of values are shown using the following format:

 _\<sort order string\> [\<lower bound inclusive\> - \<upper bound exclusive\>)_

For example, the Duration (Minutes) dimension represents the call duration in seconds with the value reported as a range of values.

|||
|:-----|:-----|
|**Duration (Minutes)** <br/> |**How to interpret** <br/> |
|062: [0 - 0)  <br/> |Stream duration = 0 minutes  <br/> |
|064: [1 - 2)  <br/> |1 minute < = stream duration < 2 minutes  <br/> |
|065: [2 - 3)  <br/> |2 minutes < = stream duration < 3 minutes  <br/> |
|066: [3 - 4)  <br/> |3 minutes < = stream duration < 4 minutes  <br/> |
|…  <br/> |…  <br/> |

The <sort order string> is used to control the sort order when presenting the data and can be used for filtering. For example, a filter on Duration (Minutes) < "065", would show streams with duration less than 2 minutes (The leading '0' is needed for the filter to work as expected).

> [!NOTE]
> The actual value of the sort order string isn't significant.

#### Enumeration pair

Dimensions that are provided as an enumeration pair are shown using the following format:

 _\<enumeration value from one end point\> : \<enumeration value from the other endpoint\>_

The ordering of the enumeration values is consistent but doesn't reflect ordering of the first or second endpoints.

For example, the Network Connection Detail Pair shows the Network Connection Detail values for the two endpoints:

|||
|:-----|:-----|
|**Network Connection Detail Pair** <br/> |**How to interpret** <br/> |
|Wired : Wired  <br/> |First and second endpoints both used wired ethernet connections.  <br/> |
|Wired : wifi  <br/> |First endpoint used wired ethernet connection and second endpoint used Wi-Fi connection, or the second endpoint used wired ethernet connection and first endpoint used Wi-Fi connection.  <br/> |
|: wifi  <br/> |First endpoint used a WiFi connection and the network connection used by the second endpoint is unknown, or the second endpoint used a WiFi connection and the network connection used by the first endpoint is unknown.  <br/> |
|…  <br/> |…  <br/> |
