# Dimensions and measurements available in Call Quality Dashboard (CQD)

The Call Quality Dashboard (CQD) for Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business Online allows you to better understand call quality of calls made with these services. This topic provides detailed information about the dimensions and measurements visible through CQD. To learn more about CQD, see [Use CQD to manage call and meeting quality in Microsoft Teams](quality-of-experience-review-guide.md).

## First and Second endpoint classification

Many of the dimensions and measurements in CQD are labeled as first or second. The following logic determines which endpoint involved in the stream or call is labeled as first:

- A Server endpoint (AV MCU, Mediation Server, and so on) is considered First when a Server is involved in the stream or call.
- A Client endpoint is considered Second unless the stream is between two Server endpoints.
- If both endpoints are the same type, first vs. second is set based on internal ordering of the user agent category to ensure that the ordering is consistent.

For example, here each row represents a pair of User Agents involved in a stream:

|User Agent Category of Caller |User Agent Category of Callee |First Endpoint |Second Endpoint|First Is Caller
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
|AV-MCU |OC (Skype for Business client) |AV-MCU |OC (Skype for Business client) |TRUE |
|OC (Skype for Business client) |AV-MCU |AV-MCU |OC (Skype for Business client) |FALSE |
|OC (Skype for Business client) |OC (Skype for Business client) |OC (Skype for Business client) |OC (Skype for Business client) |FALSE |
|AV-MCU |Mediation Server |Mediation Server |AV-MCU ||
|Mediation Server |AV-MCU |Mediation Server |AV-MCU |TRUE |
|OC (Skype for Business client) |OC Phone (Skype for Business IP Phone) |OC (Skype for Business client) |OC Phone (Skype for Business IP Phone) |TRUE |
|OC Phone (Skype for Business IP Phone) |OC (Skype for Business client) |OC (Skype for Business client) |OC Phone (Skype for Business IP Phone) |FALSE |

> [!NOTE]
> That First and Second classification is separate from which endpoint is the caller or callee. The First Is Caller dimension can be used to help identify which endpoint was the caller or callee.

## Dimensions

Dimensions information is based in part on data uploaded to the CQD portal. Many Dimension values can also be used as filters.

### Dimension data types and units

#### Boolean

Boolean values are always either True or False. In some cases, True can also be represented as 1 and False can be represented as 0.

#### Range

Dimensions that are provided as range or group of values are shown using the following format:

 _\<sort order string\> [\<lower bound inclusive\> - \<upper bound exclusive\>_

For example, the Duration (Minutes) dimension represents the call duration in seconds with the value reported as a range of values.

|Duration (Minutes) |How to interpret |
|:--- |:--- |
|062: [0 - 0) |Stream duration = 0 minutes |
|064: [1 - 2) |1 minute < = stream duration < 2 minutes |
|065: [2 - 3) |2 minutes < = stream duration < 3 minutes |
|066: [3–4) |3 minutes < = stream duration < 4 minutes |
|  | |

The \<sort order string> is used to control the sort order when presenting the data and can be used for filtering. For example, a filter on Duration (Minutes) < "065", would show streams with duration less than 2 minutes (The leading '0' is needed for the filter to work as expected). The actual value of the sort order string isn't significant.

> [!NOTE]
> You may notice ranges that seem to be invalid for a given dimension. An example would be Wifi Signal Strength showing calls in the 082: [100 - 110) range when 100 is the maximum possible value for Wifi Signal Strength. This is due to how numbers are assigned to ranges in CQD's data model. If a whole number value is 99, it will be counted in the 081: [90 - 100) range. If that value is 100, it will be counted in the 082: [100 - 110) range. This doesn't indicate that there are Wifi Signal Strength values greater than 100% being reported.

#### Enumeration strings

Strings used by CQD are often derived from data files, and these can be nearly any combination of character within the allowed length. Some dimensions look like strings, but since they can only be one of a short list of predefined values, they are enumerations and not true strings. Some enumerations strings are also used in pairs.

#### Enumeration pair

Dimensions that are provided as an enumeration pair are shown using the following format:

 _\<enumeration value from one end point\> : \<enumeration value from the other endpoint\>_

The ordering of the enumeration values is consistent but doesn't reflect ordering of the first or second endpoints.

For example, the Network Connection Detail Pair shows the Network Connection Detail values for the two endpoints:

|Network Connection Detail Pair |How to interpret |
|:--- |:--- |
|Wired : Wired |First and second endpoints both used wired ethernet connections. |
|Wired : wifi |First endpoint used wired ethernet connection and second endpoint used Wi-Fi connection, or the second endpoint used wired ethernet connection and first endpoint used Wi-Fi connection. |
|: wifi |First endpoint used a WiFi connection and the network connection used by the second endpoint is unknown, or the second endpoint used a WiFi connection and the network connection used by the first endpoint is unknown. |
| | |

#### Blank values

The table below lists possible reasons why a dimension may be blank. Many dimensions and measurements will be blank if the QoE Record Available dimension is false. This typically occurs when the call wasn't successfully established, or when the client failed to send its telemetry to the service.

### Available dimensions 

The following table lists the dimensions currently available in CQD, in the order listed in the Query Editor used to create reports or edit previously defined reports.

### Notes on measurements

#### Accuracy limitations
Certain user and call count measurements rely on performing a distinct countif operation on the data set to compute the count. There's currently an up to 0.2% error inherent with the distinct countif operation depending on the number of rows the operation is performed on. For the most accurate volume, you should use stream count measures since they don't rely on this distinct countif operation. Filtering to reduce the data volume may reduce the error but may not eliminate this source of error in distinct call and user counts. More information about this limitation can be found here [dcount aggregate function](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/dcount-aggfunction).

## Filters

Many Dimension and Measurement values can also be used as filters. You can use filters in your query to eliminate information in the same way you'd select a Dimension or Measurement to add or include information in the query.
