# Dimensions and measurements available in Call Quality Dashboard (CQD)

The Call Quality Dashboard (CQD) for Microsoft Teams allows you to understand the quality of calls made with these services. This article describes the dimensions and measurements visible through CQD. To learn more about CQD, see [Use CQD to manage call and meeting quality in Microsoft Teams](quality-of-experience-review-guide.md).

## First and Second endpoint classification

Many of the dimensions and measurements in CQD are labeled as first or second. The following logic determines which endpoint involved in the stream or call is labeled as first:

- A server endpoint (AV MCU, Mediation Server, and so on) is considered first when a server is involved in the stream or call.
- A client endpoint is considered second unless the stream is between two server endpoints.
- If both endpoints are the same type, first versus second is set based on internal ordering of the user agent category to ensure that the ordering is consistent.

In the following example, each row represents a pair of User Agents involved in a stream:

|User Agent Category of Caller |User Agent Category of Callee |First Endpoint |Second Endpoint|First Is Caller|
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
|AV-MCU |OC (Skype for Business client) |AV-MCU |OC (Skype for Business client) |TRUE |
|OC (Skype for Business client) |AV-MCU |AV-MCU |OC (Skype for Business client) |FALSE |
|OC (Skype for Business client) |OC (Skype for Business client) |OC (Skype for Business client) |OC (Skype for Business client) |FALSE |
|AV-MCU |Mediation Server |Mediation Server |AV-MCU ||
|Mediation Server |AV-MCU |Mediation Server |AV-MCU |TRUE |
|OC (Skype for Business client) |OC Phone (Skype for Business IP Phone) |OC (Skype for Business client) |OC Phone (Skype for Business IP Phone) |TRUE |
|OC Phone (Skype for Business IP Phone) |OC (Skype for Business client) |OC (Skype for Business client) |OC Phone (Skype for Business IP Phone) |FALSE |

> [!NOTE]
> That first and second classification is separate from which endpoint is the caller or callee. The First Is Caller dimension can be used to help identify which endpoint is the caller or callee.

## Dimensions

Dimensions information is based in part on data uploaded to the CQD portal. Many Dimension values can also be used as filters.

### Dimension data types and units

#### Boolean

Boolean values are always either True or False. In some cases, True can be represented as 1, and False can be represented as 0.

#### Range

Dimensions that are provided as range or group of values are shown using the following format:

 _\<sort order string\> [\<lower bound inclusive\> - \<upper bound exclusive\>_

For example, the Duration (Minutes) dimension represents the call duration in seconds with the value reported as a range of values.

|Duration (Minutes) |How to interpret |
|:--- |:--- |
|062: [0 - 0) |Stream duration = 0 minutes |
|064: [1 - 2) |1 minute < = stream duration < 2 minutes |
|065: [2 - 3) |2 minutes < = stream duration < 3 minutes |
|066: [3–4) |3 minutes < = stream duration < 4 minutes |

The \<sort order string> is used to control the sort order when presenting the data and can be used for filtering. For example, a filter on Duration (Minutes) < "065", would show streams with duration less than 2 minutes (The leading '0' is needed for the filter to work as expected). The actual value of the sort order string isn't significant.

> [!NOTE]
> You might notice ranges that seem to be invalid for a given dimension. An example is Wifi Signal Strength showing calls in the 082: [100 - 110) range when 100 is the maximum possible value. This range is due to how numbers are assigned to ranges in CQD's data model. If a whole number value is 99, it's counted in the 081: [90 - 100) range. If that value is 100, it's counted in the 082: [100 - 110) range. This doesn't indicate that there are Wifi Signal Strength values greater than 100% being reported.

#### Enumeration strings

Strings used by CQD are often derived from data files, and these strings can be any combination of character within the allowed length. Some dimensions look like strings, but since they can only be one of a short list of predefined values, they're enumerations and not true strings. Some enumerations strings are also used in pairs.

#### Enumeration pair

Dimensions that are provided as an enumeration pair are shown using the following format:

 _\<enumeration value from one end point\> : \<enumeration value from the other endpoint\>_

The ordering of the enumeration values is consistent but doesn't reflect ordering of the first or second endpoints.

For example, the Network Connection Detail Pair shows the Network Connection Detail values for the two endpoints:

|Network Connection Detail Pair |How to interpret |
|:--- |:--- |
|Wired : Wired |First and second endpoints both used wired ethernet connections. |
|Wired : wifi | One endpoint used a wired ethernet connection and the other endpoint used a Wi-Fi connection. |
|: wifi |One endpoint used a WiFi connection and the network connection used by the other endpoint is unknown. |

#### Blank values

The table below describes why a dimension might be blank. Many dimensions and measurements are blank if the QoE Record Available dimension is false. Missing QoE typically occurs when the call isn't successfully established, or when the client fails to send its telemetry to the service.

### Available dimensions

The following table lists the dimensions currently available in CQD, in the order listed in the Query Editor used to create reports or edit previously defined reports.

### Notes on measurements

#### Accuracy limitations
Certain user and call count measurements rely on performing a distinct countif operation on the data set to compute the count. There's currently an up to 0.2% error inherent with the distinct countif operation depending on the number of rows the operation is performed on. For the most accurate volume, use stream count measures, which don't rely on this distinct countif operation. Filtering to reduce the data volume might reduce the error, but might not eliminate the source of the error in distinct call and user counts. More information about this limitation can be found here [dcount aggregate function](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/dcount-aggfunction).

## Filters

You can use many Dimension and Measurement values as filters. You can use filters in your query to eliminate information in the same way you'd select a Dimension or Measurement to add or include information in the query.
