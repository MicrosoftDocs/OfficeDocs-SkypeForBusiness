# Plan for Office 365 Government - DoD deployments

This guidance is for IT pros who are driving deployments of Office 365 in US federal government entities or other entities that handle data that's subject to government regulations and requirements, where the use of Office 365 Government – DoD is appropriate to meet these requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> If your organization has already met the Office 365 Government – DoD eligibility requirements and applied for and been accepted into the program, you can skip steps 1 and 2 and go directly to step 3.

## Step 1: Determine whether your organization needs Office 365 Government - DoD and meets eligibility requirements. 

The Office 365 Government - DoD environment provides compliance with US government requirements for cloud services. In addition to enjoying the features and capabilities of Office 365, organizations benefit from the following features that are unique to Office 365 Government – DoD:

- Your organization's customer content is logically segregated from customer content in the commercial Office 365 services from Microsoft.
- Your organization's customer content is stored within the United States.
- Access to your organization's customer content is restricted to screened Microsoft personnel.
- Office 365 Government – DoD complies with certifications and accreditations that are required for US Public Sector customers.

You can find more information about the Office 365 Government – DoD offering for US Government customers at [Office 365 Government plans](https://products.office.com/government/compare-office-365-government-plans), including [eligibility requirements](https://products.office.com/government/compare-office-365-government-plans#EligibilityRequirements).

The [Office 365 US Government service description](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/office-365-us-government) describes the platform's benefits, which are centered on meeting compliance requirements within the United States.


> [!Tip]
> You might want to transfer the tables of information in the service description into an Excel workbook and add two columns: **Relevant for my organization Y/N** and **Meets the needs of my organization Y/N**. Then you can review this list with your colleagues to confirm that this service meets your organization's needs.
