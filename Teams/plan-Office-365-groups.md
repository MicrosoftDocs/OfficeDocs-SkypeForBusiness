Plan for Microsoft 365 Groups when creating teams in Microsoft Teams
==========================================================

When considering the use of Microsoft 365 Groups or when creating teams, consider what the team will be used for, who should have access, and what outcome the team will expect to achieve. Pay special attention to the number of channels you create as people can quickly become overrun by content spread too thin (across too many channels).

There are two scenarios that warrant some discussion around planning of Microsoft 365 Groups and their impact on (or by) Microsoft Teams:

-   First, since customers could have existing investments in Groups, we currently support both Public and Private groups, for the number of members currently supported, please see [Limits and specifications for Microsoft Teams](./limits-specifications-teams.md). As mentioned previously, you want to manage the membership of people to a team using the Teams client rather than the Microsoft 365 admin center. Given this scenario, if people are used to threaded conversations in Microsoft 365 Groups, it is worthwhile noting that a Groups conversation is essentially email and not the same as a chat message in a Teams channel. Educate your people about this difference and suggest they adopt the more flexible chat message format in Teams versus emailing the Group using Outlook or OWA.

-   Second, for customers who don't have existing Groups defined in Microsoft 365, you can either create them using the Microsoft 365 admin center, the Teams web, or desktop clients. As mentioned previously, manage all future membership to the Microsoft 365 group using the Teams client. Since membership to a team is also defining membership to Microsoft 365 Groups, you should prepare people for this change.

## Teams respects Microsoft 365 Groups naming policy (in private preview)

Any Microsoft 365 Groups naming policy that has been set by your admin will be applied in Teams when users create or edit team names. This includes things like mandatory prefixes or suffixes and excluding banned words.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is in private preview, which means that if you're not part of this preview, Teams doesn't yet adhere to this Microsoft 365 Groups naming policy.

To learn more, read [Microsoft 365 Groups naming policy in Teams](https://support.office.com/article/Office-365-Groups-Naming-Policy-6ceca4d3-cad1-4532-9f0f-d469dfbbb552).
