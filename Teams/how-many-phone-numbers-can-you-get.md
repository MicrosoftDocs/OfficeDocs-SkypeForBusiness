# How many telephone numbers can you get?

When you're getting phone numbers from Microsoft for your organization, you can get more numbers than you have assigned licenses. The number you can get depends on the types of phone numbers and types of licenses you've bought and assigned.

How you acquire and manage phone numbers differs depending on your Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) connectivity option: Microsoft Calling Plans, Operator Connect, Teams Phone Mobile, or Direct Routing. For more information, see [Manage phone numbers for your organization](manage-phone-numbers-landing-page.md).

For information about Teams Phone and Audio Conferencing licensing, see [Add-on licenses](teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md). For more information about Calling Plans, see [Microsoft Calling Plans](calling-plans-for-office-365.md).

The following table applies to Microsoft Calling Plans, [Audio Conferencing](deploy-audio-conferencing-teams-landing-page.md), and voice apps, such as [Call Queues and Auto Attendants](plan-auto-attendant-call-queue.md). For information about Operator Connect, Teams Phone Mobile, or Direct Routing, contact your service provider.

You can see the quantity of telephone numbers you can get from Microsoft during the search and acquire process in the Microsoft Teams admin center (**Get phone numbers**).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The limits in the following table don't include phone numbers you have ported to Microsoft.
