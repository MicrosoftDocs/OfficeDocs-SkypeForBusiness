# Microsoft Teams Calling Plans

Microsoft provides complete Private Branch Exchange (PBX) capabilities for your organization through Teams Phone. However, to enable users to make calls outside your organization, you need to connect Teams Phone  to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) by selecting a calling plan.

This article describes Teams Phone with Microsoft Teams Calling Plans--Microsoft's all-in-the-cloud voice solution for Teams users. This solution is the simplest option that connects Teams Phone to the PSTN for external calling. **With this option, Microsoft acts as your PSTN carrier.**

To find out if Microsoft Teams Calling Plans are available in your area, see [Country and region availability](country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md).

If Teams Calling Plans aren't available in your area, Microsoft provides other PSTN connectivity options. For more information about planning your voice solution, and for information on all PSTN connectivity options, see the following articles:

- [Plan your voice solution](cloud-voice-landing-page.md)
- [PSTN connectivity options](pstn-connectivity.md)

After reading this article, see [Set up Calling Plans](set-up-calling-plans.md).

 
## Calling Plan options

Microsoft Teams Calling Plans include the following options:

- [Domestic Calling Plan](#domestic-calling-plan)
- [International Calling Plan](#international-calling-plan)
- [Pay-As-You-Go Calling Plan](#pay-as-you-go-calling-plan)

To decide which option is right for your organization, ask yourself the following:

- Are Teams Calling Plans available in my area? Which user locations  have Calling Plan service? 
- Do my users need international calling?
- If some of my users don't make a significant number of outgoing calls, is the Pay-As-You-Go Calling Plan the most economical option for them?

All users in the same country with the same Calling Plan share a pool of minutes. For example, if you have 100 users located in the United States with a Domestic Calling Plan assigned, each user is allocated 3,000 minutes and they all share a pool of 300,000 minutes. All calls exceeding these minutes are billed per minute. **Pooling is only available on identical Calling Plans.**

> [!NOTE]
> The country is based on the location of the user's license in the **Microsoft 365 admin center** > **Active users** and **NOT** the billing address listed under the **Organization Profile** in the **Microsoft 365 admin center**.

For more information about monthly minutes available in each country, see [Country and region availability](country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md).

### Domestic Calling Plan

With the Domestic Calling Plan, licensed users can call out to numbers located in the country where they're assigned in Microsoft 365. Unlimited incoming minutes are included. Outgoing minutes are included based on the license purchased.

There are two Domestic Calling Plan options to choose from based on your organization's billing location.  

- **Microsoft Teams Domestic Calling Plan (customers in US/UK/CA)**: For organizations in the United States, Puerto Rico, United Kingdom, and Canada. Organizations can assign this license to end users in any market where Calling Plans are available.  

- **Microsoft Teams Domestic Calling Plan (customers outside US/UK/CA)**: For organizations in Australia (through Telstra), Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan (through Softbank), Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. Organizations can assign this license to end users in any market where Calling Plans are available. 

Once these plans are assigned, the minutes available vary depending on the location of the end user. For more information, see [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](calling-plan-overview.md).  

> [!NOTE]
> Mexico has its own Domestic Calling Plan. You must purchase the independent Domestic Calling Plan for Mexico. 



### International Calling Plan

The International Calling Plan includes both domestic and international minutes for outbound calls. Domestic minutes allow users to call numbers in the country where their Microsoft 365 license is assigned. International minutes allow users to call international numbers in [196 countries](country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/users-can-make-outbound-calls-to-these-countries-and-regions.md). Unlimited incoming minutes are included. Outgoing minutes are included based on the license purchased.

For more information, see [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](calling-plan-overview.md).  

### Pay-As-You-Go Calling Plan

With the Pay-As-You-Go Calling Plan, licensed users can call out to numbers located in the country where their Microsoft 365 license is assigned to the user based on the user's location, and to international numbers in [196 countries](country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/users-can-make-outbound-calls-to-these-countries-and-regions.md). 

Unlimited incoming minutes are included. No outgoing minutes are included. All outgoing calls are charged based on the minutes used, either with Communication Credits or post-usage billing (for new commerce experience calling subscriptions only). Licenses are assigned to users based on their location.

To learn how to fund and use minutes for a Pay-As-You-Go Calling Plan, see [How to fund a Pay-As-You-Go Calling Plan](#how-to-fund-a-pay-as-you-go-calling-plan).

 **(((((((((((Customers (in the US and PR?) can purchase pay-as-you-go calling plans for end users in Zone 1 & Zone 2 markets.)))))))))))**

There are three **Pay-As-You-Go Calling Plan** options to choose from:

- **Pay-As-You-Go Calling Plan Zone 1**: For users in the United States and Puerto Rico, United Kingdom, and Canada.

- **Pay-As-You-Go Calling Plan Zone 2**: For users in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.

- **Pay-As-You-Go Calling Plan Mexico**: For users in Mexico.

## How to buy Calling Plans

1. You must first purchase a **Teams Phone add-on license**. To do that, [sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center and choose **Billing**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=868433) > **Purchase services** > **Add-on subscriptions** > **Buy now**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Depending on your plan, you may need to buy more add-ons before you can buy Teams Phone licenses. To learn more, see [Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](./teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md).

2. After you buy Teams Phone licenses, you can buy a Calling Plan by [signing in to the Microsoft 365 admin center and choose **Billing**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=868433) > **Purchase services** > **Add-on subscriptions**, and then selecting **Buy now**. 

You can buy and assign different Calling Plans to different users, depending on the needs of your organization. After you select the Calling Plan you need, proceed to checkout. You assign a plan to each user in the Microsoft 365 admin center. To learn how, see [Assign Microsoft Teams add-on licenses](./teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md).

## How to fund a Pay-As-You-Go Calling Plan

Pay-As-You-Go Calling Plans don't have a set number of outgoing call minutes like the Domestic or International Calling Plans. Instead, some admins may need to take additional steps to fund their Pay-As-You-Go Calling Plan. Until the Pay-As-You-Go Calling Plan is properly funded, users aren't able to make outgoing calls.

There are two ways you can fund and use minutes with a Pay-As-You-Go Calling Plan:

- **Purchase the Pay-As-You-Go Calling Plan through the new commerce experience (NCE)**
  - Customers who purchased their calling plan through the new commerce experience are able to pay for the outgoing call minutes they used in the previous month. This billing is also called post-usage or post-consumption billing.
  - For instructions on purchasing a calling plan through the new commerce experience, see [Enable pay-as-you-go for your subscription](/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/manage-pay-as-you-go-services) and [New commerce overage for telco pay-as-you-go](/partner-center/new-commerce-telco-payg).

- **Purchase Communication Credits**
  - This option is for customers who didn't purchase their calling plan through the new commerce experience (NCE). These customers need to purchase Communication Credits to fund their Pay-As-You-Go Calling Plan.
  - For instructions on how to purchase and assign Communication Credits, see [Set up Communication Credits for your organization](set-up-communications-credits-for-your-organization.md).
