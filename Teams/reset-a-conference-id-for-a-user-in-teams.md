# Reset a conference ID for a user in Microsoft Teams

A dynamic conference ID is included at the bottom of meeting invitations along with the dial-in phone numbers that can be used by callers to call in to a meeting. When the user dials the phone number, the auto attendant for the meeting will ask the caller to enter this conference ID so they can attend the meeting.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If your conferencing provider is Microsoft, your users' conference IDs are set to Dynamic Only by default. Unfortunately, there's no ability to change it to become static, as this is now unsupported. Conference IDs are only automatically set for Microsoft Teams users enabled for Audio Conferencing. 


## Resetting the conference ID for a user

![teams-logo-30x30.png](media/teams-logo-30x30.png) Using the Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business Admin Center

1. In the left navigation, click **Users**, and then select the user from the list of available users.

2. Click **Edit**.

3. Under **Audio Conferencing** click **Reset conference ID**.

2. In the **Reset conference ID** window, click **Reset**. A conference ID will be automatically created and an email sent to the user with the new conference ID. By default, emails are sent to users, but this can be turned off.   

    
> [!NOTE]
> After you reset the conference ID, an email with the new conference ID will be sent to the user. This email will be sent to the primary email address, in many cases, their Office 365 mailbox. The email contains the new conference ID, default dial-in phone number(s) and instructions for updating existing meetings.

## What else should I know?

- You can send all of the conferencing information to the user in an email that includes the conference ID and dial-in phone numbers by clicking **Send conference info in email** for the user in the **Audio Conferencing** section. It doesn't send the PIN.
    
- A conference ID will contain 7 digits, and you can't change its length.
    
- After it has been reset, you can see the new conference ID listed under **Conference ID**.
    
- After a new conference ID is created, the old conference ID can't be used by callers. You should notify users to reschedule their existing meeting invites to make sure the new conference ID is added to the invitations.

Windows PowerShell is all about managing users and what users are allowed or not allowed to do. With Windows PowerShell, you can manage Office 365 using a single point of administration that can simplify your daily work when you have multiple tasks to do.
