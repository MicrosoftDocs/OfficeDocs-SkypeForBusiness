# Update apps in Microsoft Teams

In most cases, after app developers publish an app update, the new version automatically appears for users. However, there are some updates to the [Microsoft Teams manifest](/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema) that require user acceptance to complete:

* A bot was added or removed
* An existing bot's "botId" property changed
* An existing bot's "isNotificationOnly" property changed
* A bot's SupportsCalling, SupportsVideo, and SupportsFiles capability was added
* A messaging extension was added
* A new connector was added
* Permissions inside "Authorization" were added or changed

> [!NOTE]
