# Create a custom meeting template in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE[Teams Premium ECM](includes/teams-premium-ecm.md)]

Microsoft Teams custom meeting templates (a Teams Premium feature) allow you to specify values for many of the meeting options available to meeting organizers. Templates can configure options that meeting organizers can change or can lock options so that meeting organizers can't change them. For more information about custom meeting templates, see [Overview of custom meeting templates in Microsoft Teams](custom-meeting-templates-overview.md).

You can create up to 50 custom templates. See [Manage meeting templates in Microsoft Teams](manage-meeting-templates.md) for information on how to manage which templates are available to your users.

For each option in the template, you can define the following:

- **Default value** - This is the value that is applied to a meeting when the template is used.
- **Visible** - This determines if the meeting organizer can see this option.
- **Lock status** - This determines if the meeting organizer can change the option that was set by the template. If the option is locked, the meeting organizer can't change it.
