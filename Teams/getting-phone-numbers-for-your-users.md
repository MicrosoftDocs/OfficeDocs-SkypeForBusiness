# Getting phone numbers for your users

Before you can set up users in your organization to make and receive phone calls, you must get phone numbers for them.
  
There are three ways to get new user numbers:

- **Use the Skype for Business admin center.** For some countries/regions, you can get numbers for your users using the Skype for Business admin center, see "Get new phone numbers for your users," below.
    
- **Port your existing numbers.** You can port or transfer existing numbers from your current service provider or phone carrier to Office 365. See [Transfer phone numbers to Office 365](/microsoftteams/transfer-phone-numbers-to-office-365) or [Manage phone numbers for your organization](/microsoftteams/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization) for more information to help you do this.  
  
- **Use a request form for new numbers.** Sometimes (depending on your country/region) you won't be able to get your new phone numbers using the Skype for Business admin center, or you will need specific phone numbers or area codes. If so, you will need to download a form and send it back to us. See [Manage phone numbers for your organization](/microsoftteams/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization) for more information.
    
You must use the **Add new user numbers** page to see, search, acquire, and reserve those numbers. You can search by **Country/Region**, **State**, and **City**, and then enter the number of phone numbers you will need for your users.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you need help setting up phone numbers for your organization, you can [Contact support for business products - Admin Help](https://support.office.com/article/32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b).

1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.

3. In the left navigation go to **Voice** > **Phone numbers**, click **Add new number** ![Add button](media/c224fbd0-f0f5-46ce-a1a7-73adf4540ef7.png), and then click **New user numbers**.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For you to see the **Voice** option in the left navigation in the Skype for Business admin center, you must first buy at least one **Enterprise E5 license**, one **Phone System** add-on license, or one **Audio Conferencing** add-on license.
    
4. On the **Add new user numbers** page, choose the following:
    
   - **Country/Region**
    
   - **State/Region**
    
   - **City**
    
5. Under **Quantity**, enter the number of phone numbers that you want for your organization and click **Add** to create a reservation. You have 10 minutes to select your phone numbers; if you take more than 10 minutes, the phone numbers will be returned to the pool of numbers.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > You can see the number of phone numbers, which is based on the number of licenses, listed next to **Total user numbers you can acquire**. For details, see [How many phone numbers can you get?](/microsoftteams/how-many-phone-numbers-can-you-get)

7. Select the phone numbers you want, and then click **Acquire numbers**.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The number of phone numbers for users (subscribers) is equal to the total number of **Domestic Calling Plan** and/or **Domestic and International Calling Plan** licenses you have assigned multiplied by 1.1, plus 10 additional phone numbers. For example, if you have 50 users in total with a Domestic Calling Plan and/or Domestic and International Calling Plan, you can acquire **65** phone numbers **(50 x 1.1 + 10)**. For details, see [How many phone numbers can you get?](/microsoftteams/how-many-phone-numbers-can-you-get). If you need to get more telephone numbers than this, please contact [Contact support for business products - Admin Help](https://support.office.com/article/32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b). 
  
   **Port or transfer phone numbers from your service provider or phone carrier**
  
- If you need 999 or fewer phone numbers for your users, you can use the **New Local Number Port Order** wizard in the Skype for Business admin center. Follow the steps found in [Transfer phone numbers to Office 365](/microsoftteams/transfer-phone-numbers-to-office-365) to transfer your phone numbers over to Skype for Business Online.
    
- If you need to port more than 999 phone numbers, see [Manually submit a custom service request](manually-submit-a-custom-service-request.md) to submit a port order service request or order to get all of these phone numbers ported over to Office 365.
