# Getting phone numbers for your users

Before you can set up users in your organization to make and receive phone calls, you must get phone numbers for them.
  
There are three ways to get user numbers:

- **Use the Microsoft Teams admin center.** For some countries and regions, you can get numbers for your users using the Microsoft Teams admin center. See [Get new phone numbers for your users](#get-new-phone-numbers-for-your-users).

- **Port your existing numbers.** You can port or transfer existing numbers from your current service provider or phone carrier. See [Transfer phone numbers to Teams](/microsoftteams/phone-number-calling-plans/transfer-phone-numbers-to-teams) or [Manage phone numbers for your organization](/microsoftteams/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization) for more information to help you do this.  
  
- **Use a request form for new numbers.** Sometimes (depending on your country or region) you won't be able to get your new phone numbers using the Microsoft Teams Admin Center or you'll need specific phone numbers or area codes. See [Manage phone numbers for your organization](/microsoftteams/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization) for more information.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you need help setting up phone numbers for your organization, please [contact Support Contact for Business Products - Admin Help(https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/contact-support-for-business-products?view=o365-worldwide&tabs=online.
  
## Get new phone numbers for your users

You must be a Teams service admin to make these changes. See [Use Teams administrator roles to manage Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/using-admin-roles) to read about getting admin roles and permissions.

1. Go to the Microsoft Teams Admin Center.
2. In the left navigation, go to **Voice** > **Phone numbers**, and then click **Add**.
3. Enter a name for the order and add a description.
4. On the Location and quantity page, do the following:
    1. Under **Country or region**, select a country or region.
    2. Under **Number type**, select **User (subscriber)**.
    3. Under **Location**, select a location. If you need to create a new location, click **Add a location**.
    4. Under **Area code**, select an area code.
    5. Under **Quantity**, enter the number of numbers that you want for your organization, and then click **Next** to select your numbers.
5. Select the numbers you want. You have 10 minutes to select your phone numbers and place your order. If you take more than 10 minutes, the phone numbers will be returned to the pool of numbers.
6. When you're ready to place your order, click **Place order**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The number of phone numbers for users (subscribers) is equal to the total number of **Domestic Calling Plan** and/or **Domestic and International Calling Plan** licenses you have assigned multiplied by 1.1, plus 10 additional phone numbers. For example, if you have 50 users in total with a Domestic Calling Plan and/or Domestic and International Calling Plan, you can acquire **65** phone numbers **(50 x 1.1 + 10)**. For details, see [How many phone numbers can you get?](/microsoftteams/how-many-phone-numbers-can-you-get). If you need to get more phone numbers than this, [contact Support Contact for Business Products - Admin Help](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/contact-support-for-business-products?view=o365-worldwide&tabs=online).
  
## Port or transfer phone numbers from your service provider or phone carrier
  
- If you need 999 or fewer phone numbers for your users, use the porting wizard in the Microsoft Teams Admin Center. Follow the steps in [Transfer phone numbers to Teams](/microsoftteams/phone-number-calling-plans/transfer-phone-numbers-to-teams). If your country or region isn't listed in the porting wizard, you can [manually submit a port order](phone-number-calling-plans/manually-submit-port-order.md) or see [Manage phone numbers for your organization](/microsoftteams/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization) to download the correct Letter of Authorization (LOA).

- If you need to port more than 999 phone numbers, you can [manually submit a port order](phone-number-calling-plans/manually-submit-port-order.md) or see [Manage phone numbers for your organization](/microsoftteams/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization) to download the correct Letter of Authorization (LOA) and then send it to [the PSTN service desk](manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/contact-pstn-service-desk.md) to get all your numbers transferred.

## View the phone numbers for your organization

In the left navigation of the admin center, go to **Voice** > **Phone numbers** to view the numbers for your organization, including location, number type, and status information.
  
## Assign phone numbers to users

After you get your phone numbers, you'll need to assign a number to each of your users. See [Assign, change, or remove a phone number for a user](/microsoftteams/assign-change-or-remove-a-phone-number-for-a-user) for more information.
