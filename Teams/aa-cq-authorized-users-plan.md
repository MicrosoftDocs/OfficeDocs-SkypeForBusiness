# Plan for Auto attendant and Call queue authorized users

> [!NOTE]
> Some of these features are in limited public preview. For more information, contact your Microsoft customer success manager. Information in this article is subject to change.

This article is for IT Pros and administrators who want to delegate certain Auto attendant or Call queue configuration capabilities to the users in their organization. This article describes benefits and licensing requirements. After reading this article, see [Set up authorized users](aa-cq-authorized-users.md) and [Manage voice applications policies](manage-voice-applications-policies.md) for more information.

## Benefits

Through **Authorized users**, you enable users in your organizationâ€”for example, business owners, team leads, supervisors of call queues--to manage day-to-day operational changes directly.

For example, authorized users can configure business hours, holiday greetings, and after hours call routing for Auto attendants and Call queues. For features only available with Teams Premium, authorized users can also configure business, after hours, and holiday call routing and they can view real-time and historical metrics for Auto attendants and Call queues all within the Queues app in the Teams client.

For a complete list of features, see [Manage voice applications policies](manage-voice-applications-policies.md).

## Licensing requirements

All Authorized users must have a Teams Phone license and must be "voice enabled." To assign the Teams Phone license, use the [Set-CsPhoneNumberAssignment](/powershell/module/teams/set-csphonenumberassignment) cmdlet and set the `-EnterpriseVoiceEnabled` parameter to $true.

For some configuration features, such as those available only in the Queues app, users must also have a Teams Premium license. For information about which features require Teams Premium, see [Manage voice applications policies](manage-voice-applications-policies.md).

For more information about assigning licenses, see [Set up Auto attendant and Call queue authorized users](aa-cq-authorized-users.md).

## Overview of steps for setting up authorized users

- Step 1 - Assign licenses and enable users for voice
