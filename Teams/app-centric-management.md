# Use app centric management to manage access to apps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All organizations don't have app centric management feature available. If you were not using custom permission policies and you weren't an enterprise customer, we migrated your organization to use this feature. If you are using custom permission policies or you are an enterprise customer, then you will soon be able to migrate to the app centric management feature on your own. For timelines, see [Message Center post MC688930](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/MessageCenter/:/messages/MC688930) or [Microsoft 365 roadmap item 151829](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&searchterms=151829).
>
> If you see policies on the [permission policies page](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/app-permission), continue to [use app permission policies](teams-app-permission-policies.md) or migrate to this feature on your own.
> If your org is now using the app centric management feature, you see the following message on the permission policy page.

App centric management functionality introduces a new way to control access to Teams apps for users and groups. It replaces app permission policies. This functionality lets you specify which users and groups can use each app and you can control it on a per-app basis.

You can manage access to apps for individual users, supported groups, or everyone in the organization. You have complete control over who can or can't add apps in your organization. You can also control the access to new apps that we publish to Teams app store.

## How is app centric management different than permission policy

Previously, when using permission policies, you determined access to apps using the following three settings:

* Org-wide app setting for third party apps: It applies at an org-level and controls if all third party apps are available for every user or not.
* App status: It applies at an app-level as allow or block and controls if it's available to any user or not.
* Permission policy: It applies at a user-level and controls if a specific user is allowed to use an app or not.

App centric management feature simplifies these settings. Each app contains its access definition using a list of users and groups that you assign to it. It lets you manage each app individually based on your user's needs and organization's compliance and risk posture.

When using this functionality, you determine access to apps using one of the following options for each app:

| New option | Who gets the app | How does it map with previous settings |
|------------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `Everyone` | Available to all org users, new users, and guests | Same effect as allowing an app and global (Org-wide default) app permission policy allowing all users to use it. |
| `Specific users or groups` | Only the users and groups that you select can use the app. The supported group types are security groups, Microsoft 365 groups, dynamic user membership groups, nested groups, and the distribution lists. | Same as using a custom app permission policy to restrict the use of app to selected users or groups. |
| `No one` | Not available to any user | Same as a blocked app. |

The method to allow users access to an app changes with this functionality. In the past, to allow access to a user, you'd add the app as an allowed app in a policy and assign that policy to the user. Using this functionality, you just modify the availability of an app to let selected users use it. Also, you don't have to create multiple policies for different combinations of apps and allowed users.

## Migrate to app centric management

Previously, we automatically migrated organizations that weren't using any custom policies. Admins can now do an on-demand migration. Understand the difference between the two types of migration.

| Type of migration | Who does it   | Requirement                             | How is it done                        |
|-------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Assisted          | Administrator | Org uses one or more custom policies    | Guided UI in admin center             |
| Automatic         | Microsoft     | Org uses only the default global policy | Automatic, without admin intervention |

We strongly recommend that you prepare for the migration and follow these steps to prepare:

1. Log into Teams admin center and access Teams apps > [Permission policies](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/app-permission) page. Take inventory of the apps in the permission policies and identify the users and groups that the apps are allowed or blocked for. During the migration, you may have to manually edit the availability for some apps for the existing users and groups. For details, see step 5.

1. On the permission policies page, select **Get started**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/acm-start-prompt.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the policy page with prompt to migrate to app centric management.":::

1. Select policies that you want to migrate and select **Next**. The page displays only those policies that are assigned to users or groups. Also, we migrate only those apps and their availability that are part of the policies that you choose to migrate. Apps in the unselected policies aren't part of the migration and canâ€™t be migrated later. However, you can manually edit the availability for any app after the migration.

    :::image type="content" source="media/acm-migration-select-policies.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the app centric management migration UI to select policies."  lightbox="media/acm-migration-select-policies-large.png":::

1. Verify the app availability for the users on the next page. In the following three tabs, it shows a list of apps from your Org-wide app settings and the app permission policies that you choose to migrate.

   * Available to everyone: List of apps allowed for everyone in your organization.
   * Available to specific users and groups: List of apps that are selectively allowed for at least one org user or a supported group.
   * Available to no one: List of apps that nobody in the org can use.

1. In each tab, you can modify the app availability to one of the [three app availability types](#how-is-app-centric-management-different-than-permission-policy), as necessary. Edit availability option appears in **Available to specific users and groups** tab if the app availability isn't clear and admin input is needed to proceed. It is because the apps aren't present in the policies that you selected to migrate or have conflicting availability. You must assign such apps to before you can proceed.

    :::image type="content" source="media/acm-migration-availability.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing three tabs during migration that help you review and modify the app availability.":::

   > [!TIP]
   > If you see many apps in this tab, you likely have policies that have conflicting apps availability. For example, a policy that allows many apps and another policy that blocks the same apps. In such a scenario, we recommend that you uncheck the policy that leads to a conflict or you edit the availability in this tab.

1. You can validate the changes on a per-app or a per-user basis. Select a tab and type the name of the app or the user.

    :::image type="content" source="media/acm-verify-per-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the option to verify available of for each user and users who receive a particular app."  lightbox="media/acm-verify-per-app-large.png":::

1. On the final review UI, you can see the apps, their availability, and the Org-wide app settings that apply after the migration. You can download this information as a CSV file to evaluate further. For example, you can use the inventory mapping from Step 1 to ensure that the app availability is as intended. Once assured, select **Start migration** and follow the prompts.

    :::image type="content" source="media/acm-migration-review.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the last UI to review all settings.":::

During migration, you can save a draft of the migration progress using the **Finish later** option. Also, you can cancel and delete the saved draft using the **Reset all changes** option.

> [!NOTE]
> The existing Manage apps UI gets disabled when you start the migration. If you aren't ready to proceed or want to make change to the exiting permission policies, open the wizard and select the Reset all changes option. You can restart the migration again.

After migration, your blocked apps continue to remain unavailable to users. The statuses of such apps show as `unblocked` now, but the apps are assigned to `No one` in the `Available to` column on the Manage apps page. It means that org user can't use the app, just as you intended before.

## Add or modify app availability for users

To let users add and use an app, you must assign users or groups to an app. It takes up to 24-72 hours for the changes to take effect. In rare cases, it may take up to 6 days for the availability changes to reflect in the client.

1. In Teams admin center, go to the [Manage apps](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps) page, search for the required app, and select the app name to open its app details page. You can't assign apps in bulk.

1. Select the **Assignments** tab.

1. Select **Assign** or **Assign app**.

1. Select the required option from **Manage who can install this app** menu. When assigning users or groups, search for the user or the group from the **Search for users or groups** menu. Select **Apply**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/acm-add-modify-access.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to define the app availability from the app details page.":::

1. To remove one or more users or groups from an app, select the rows and select **Remove**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/acm-remove-access.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to remove the existing availability of an app from the app details page." lightbox="media/acm-remove-access-large.png":::

## Default settings for app availability

In addition to defining the availability of an app, you can also control the default app availability of any new apps. You can control it for each type of app. For new organizations, the default setting is set to let users install apps by default. For existing organizations, [old settings are mapped to new access settings](#mapping-between-old-permission-policies-and-new-app-availability).

To change this default setting, access [Manage apps](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps) page, select **Actions** > **Org-wide app settings**, and modify the required settings.

The Org-wide app settings apply to:

* All the new apps made available in Teams app store.
* All the existing apps that you didn't actively manage, that is, you didn't change the availability of.

:::image type="content" source="media/acm-org-wide-app-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the org-wide app settings in an organization that uses app centric management feature.":::

The Org-wide app settings donâ€™t apply to:

* All apps that have user assignment set to Specific users and groups and saved by you.
* All apps that were assigned to Everyone or to No one and saved individually.
* Any blocked apps.

Consider a scenario where you started using the feature and all apps were assigned to everyone. Now, you changed an app's availability to a specific group or some users. After you save this change, if you change the Org-wide app setting titled **Let users install and use available apps by default**, then this particular app continues to be assigned to the specific group or users. Your change to the org-wide app setting applies only to those apps for which you didn't change the availability. Further, if you again change the **Let users install and use available apps by default** setting, the availability of all other apps is again impacted, except the app that you actively managed.

## View apps in your organization

You can view all apps in the catalog and easily access the app availability from the [Manage apps](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps) page. You can sort and filter using all three types of app availability. To know about the Microsoft-provided apps, see [list of Microsoft created apps](apps-in-teams.md#list-of-apps-created-by-microsoft).

:::image type="content" source="media/acm-app-filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to filter apps by combining various criteria such as app availability, app type, and app status.":::

### View all apps available to a specific user

On the **[Manage users](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/users)** page, select a user to open the user details page, and select the **Apps** tab. The tab lists the apps that the user has access to. To easily locate the type of access for an app, you can search for the name of the app.

:::image type="content" source="media/acm-manage-user-apps-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to view all the apps that a user has access to, from the Manage users page.":::

Each app displays the type of its availability, which indicates how the user is assigned to the app: through availability to everyone, direct availability to a user, or through a group. The list shows only those apps that are assigned to the user and that are allowed in the organization for use. Apps assigned to no one and app that are blocked in the organization don't appear in this list.

You can remove app availability for a user. Select an app that is directly assigned to the user and select **Remove**. You canâ€™t remove availability for a user if the app is available to everyone or to a group.

## Mapping between old permission policies and new app availability

When your tenant's admin center receives this feature, the following updates are made to the app access. The access to apps doesn't change and the update only maps your existing permission policies to new availability.

| App permission policy and org settings earlier | Org-wide app settings while using this feature |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
|  Global permission policy for Microsoft apps was `Allow all` or Global permission policy for Microsoft apps was `Block an app(s), allow all others`  |  `Allow users install available apps by default` for Microsoft apps is set to on |
|  Global permission policy for Microsoft apps was `Block all` or Global permission policy for Microsoft apps was `Allow app(s), Block all others` | `Allow users install available apps by default` for Microsoft apps is set to off |
|  Third party app setting in the Org-wide app settings was set to on; New third party app setting in the org-wide app setting was set to on; Global permission policy for third party apps was `Allow all`; or Global permission policy for third party apps was `Block an app(s), allow all others`  |  `Allow users install available apps by default` for third party apps is set to on |
|  third party app setting in the Org-wide app settings was set to off; New third party app setting in the org-wide app setting was set to off; Global permission policy for third party apps was `Block all`; or Global permission policy for third party apps was `Allow app(s), Block all others` | `Allow users install available apps by default` for third party apps is set to off |
|  Global permission policy for Custom apps was `Allow all` or Global permission policy for Custom apps was `Block an app(s), allow all others` | `Allow users install available apps by default` for custom apps is set to on |
|  Global permission policy for custom apps was `Block all` or Global permission policy for custom apps was `Allow app(s), Block all others` | `Allow users install available apps by default` for custom apps is set to off |

| App status earlier | Permission policy applied earlier | App availability when using this feature |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Blocked            | Blocked                           | No one can install                       |
| Blocked            | Allowed                           | No one can install                       |
| Allowed            | Blocked                           | No one can install                       |
| Allowed            | Allowed                           | Everyone                                 |

## Considerations and known limitations

* You can add up to 99 users or groups at a time to an app.

* When searching for users or groups to add, the UI displays only 20 results. If you don't find the expected results, refine your search query to use the exact name.

* After migration, your blocked apps continue to remain unavailable to users. The status of such apps is `unblocked` now but the apps are available to `No one` in the `Available to` column on the Manage apps page. It means that no org user can use the app as you intended before.

* After you switch to this feature, you can't access, edit, or use permission policies. Once your organization migrates, you can't revert the migration.

* You can't update app availability in bulk.
