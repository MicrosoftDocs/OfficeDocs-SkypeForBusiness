# Using an encoder for live streaming with Microsoft Teams

**APPLIES TO:** ✔️Meetings ✖️Webinars ✔️Town halls ✔️Live events

Video encoders allow users to produce Microsoft Teams live events via external hardware or software-based solutions.

## Overview

An encoder takes audio and video content from various sources you use during a live event such as a camera, a microphone, a desktop screen capture, and so on. It compresses and converts that media into a suitable digital format, then sends it to Teams for live streaming to your audience. Consult our [Custom Production playbook](https://aka.ms/CustomProductionVEP) to learn more about how you can use Teams production technologies (such as NDI) with external encoders.

## Production workflow when using an encoder

The workflow for producing a Teams Live Event is as follows:

For a live event scheduled in Teams or Viva Engage, the **Teams Encoder** option must be selected. For a town hall, the **RTMP-In** meeting option must be turned on. This provisions an RTMP endpoint, which is provided with an RTMP(S) URL and corresponding stream key. The URL and stream key are used by the encoder to connect to the RTMP endpoint for the scheduled live event.

### Common video encoders used for live streaming

Microsoft has validated the video encoders for live streaming with Teams in the following list.
