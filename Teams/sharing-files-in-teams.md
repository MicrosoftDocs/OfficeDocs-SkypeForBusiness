# Sharing files in Microsoft Teams

The sharing features in Teams let users share content with other Teams users in their organization. Sharing in Teams is based on the settings configured for SharePoint and OneDrive: whatever you set up for SharePoint and OneDrive will control sharing in Teams as well.

Teams sharing lets users do the following:

- Share files from OneDrive.

- Share files across Teams.

- Share files from their list of recently accessed files (typically, these are the files users are most interested in sharing).

- Stay within Teams when they click a file name. 

Long SharePoint URLS and browser URLS that point to a file are shortened. Teams uses just the file name to link to a file, and displays a dialog in which users can set permissions for files they want to share with others.

Additionally, the **Get link** option has been changed to **Copy link** to eliminate any confusion that users might have about giving others access to the file. Users stay within Teams when they click a file name.
