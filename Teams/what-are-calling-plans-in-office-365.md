# What are Calling Plans in Office 365?

Calling Plans are an add-on telephone service that, when combined with Phone System in Office 365, can become the phone system for your entire organization. A Calling Plan provides the people in your business with a primary phone number and lets them make and receive phone calls outside of your organization. There are two types of Calling Plans: **Domestic Calling Plan** and a **Domestic and International Calling Plan**. To learn more, see [Calling Plans for Office 365](calling-plans-for-office-365.md).
  
Users who are assigned phone numbers can make voice calls from all Skype for Business devices, including [Getting phones for Skype for Business Online](/SkypeForBusiness/what-is-phone-system-in-office-365/getting-phones-for-skype-for-business-online/getting-phones-for-skype-for-business-online), PCs, and mobile devices. They can control their calls through desktop phones by using features such as mute/unmute, hold/resume, call transferring, and call forwarding.
  
## Start here

Before you set this up, take a look at these topics for questions you might have:
  
- To see if your country/region has Calling Plans available and the number of minutes you will get select the [Countries and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md) from the drop down.
    
- If you think you will go over the number of minutes, [Set up Communications Credits for your organization](set-up-communications-credits-for-your-organization.md).
    
- You can find pricing information [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=799761).
