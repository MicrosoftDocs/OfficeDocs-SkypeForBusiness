# Roll out Microsoft Teams First

Microsoft Teams can help your employees stay connected and collaborate with each other, especially in the current unprecedented time where remote work is a reality of employees around the world. Being able to chat, do video meetings and collaborate on Office documents within Teams can help companies stay productive. Whether you are a small business, a non-profit or a large organization, you can get started with Teams as the first workload within Microsoft 365 or Office 365 suite before deploying any other Office app or service.

This article details the considerations you must make with the "Teams First" approach.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While Teams can be your organization's first cloud deployed workload, deploying Teams should be part of your overall cloud deployment strategy.

If you have already rolled out other Microsoft 365 or Office 365 services and Teams is your next workload to roll out (instead of the first), start with [How to roll out Teams](./deploy-overview.md).

## Start here

To get started with your Teams First deployment you will need to meet at minimum some prerequisites. The following list will show what you must have in place for your organization before Teams can be enabled:

1.  A Microsoft 365 or Office 365 organization configured with your domain name

2.  Azure Active Directory connectivity or similar cloud identity sync solution â€“ with all required attributes synched with your tenant  
    To understand the attributes synchronized with Azure AD Connect, read [Azure AD Connect sync: Attributes synchronized to Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/reference-connect-sync-attributes-synchronized)

3.  Appropriate user licenses assigned for Teams  
    To understand Teams licensing, read [Microsoft Teams service description](/office365/servicedescriptions/teams-service-description).

4.  Organization's network prepared for Teams  
    To understand network preparation, read [Prepare your organization's network for Teams](prepare-network.md).

5.  Allow network access to Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive for Business in Microsoft 365 or Office 365: [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges](/office365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges).

> [!NOTE]
> Tenants created after September 1, 2019 are provisioned in Teams Only mode.
> 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have Skype for Business Server deployed, and your tenant was provisioned AFTER September 1, 2019, please contact support to enable coexistence capabilities for Teams. Make sure your 'Organization wide upgrade policy' is set to 'Island mode' <span class="underline">before</span> you assign any Teams licenses to a user.

## Migration Starting points

Your journey to Microsoft 365 or Office 365 and features available in Teams depending on your starting point and the existence of on premises Skype for Business or Lync server. The following sections will detail basic capabilities and configuration options in addition to the prerequisites above. We have broken down the starting point scenarios to the following topics:

**Tenant Teams Configuration**: Tenant and user modes are used to control the recipient's behavior. These settings can be assigned on the tenant level or the user level in an organization. To learn more, read [Coexistence with Skype for Business](coexistence-chat-calls-presence.md).

**Chat / External communication in Teams**: Chat services refer to peer-to-peer or group chat conversations within and organization or externally to the organization. External communication is also referred to as federation in Skype for Business.

**Create and view meetings in Teams**: A user can always create online meetings via the Outlook Teams add-in and PSTN dial-in is available in all scenarios once the user is licensed. Teams and Skype for Business store calendaring information in the user's Exchange mailbox. On premises Exchange server must be Exchange Server 2016 CU3 or above for the Teams client to be able to interact with the user's mailbox. Without Exchange mailbox access the Calendar icon in Teams will not appear and they user will not be able to view, create or modify meetings in the Teams client.

**Calling features VoIP / PSTN in Teams**: Calling can be Voice over IP (VoIP) or Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). VoIP connectivity happens natively between Teams clients, while PSTN connectivity happen when a user dials an outside phone number.  

Teams supports two types of PSTN connectivity. Microsoft Calling Plan, when Microsoft provides telephony infrastructure including the phone number for a user, or Direct Routing configuration, where the customer provides the telephony connectivity over a Session Border Controller (SBC) for the Teams user.  
To learn more, read [Which Calling Plan is right for you?](calling-plan-landing-page.md) and [Phone System Direct Routing](direct-routing-landing-page.md).

**Teams and Channels collaboration in Teams**: In Teams, teams are groups of people brought together for work, projects, or common interests. Teams are made up of channels. Each channel is built around a topic, like "Team Events," a department name, or just for fun. Channels are where you hold meetings, have conversations, and work on files together. During collaboration

**OneDrive for Business (P2P file sharing) in Teams**: Outside of Teams and Channels, Teams users can share files peer-to-peer using OneDrive for business or other P2P sharing file programs such as Citrix Files, DropBox, Box and Google Drive. For OneDrive for business a user must have SharePoint Online license assigned.

**Application Platform**: Apps provide out-of-the-box tools for your organization to get more out of Teams. These apps combine the functionality of tabs, messaging extensions, connectors, and bots provided by Microsoft, built by a third-party, or by developers in your organization.

**Security and Compliance features:** Teams has a wide range of information to help you with compliance areas, including retention policies, data loss prevention (DLP), eDiscovery and legal hold for channels, chats and files, audit log search. To learn more, read [Security and compliance in Microsoft Teams](security-compliance-overview.md).  

> [!NOTE]
> Advance eDiscovery features require E5 licensing.

[Compare licensing options](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compare-all-microsoft-365-plans).

Read [How Exchange and Microsoft Teams interact](exchange-teams-interact.md) to learn which compliance features are available in your scenario.

## Support Services reference

Teams relies on Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business and Microsoft 365 Groups to provide your users with a fully integrated Microsoft 365 or Office 365 experience. As noted above, Teams will work without full deploying these services â€“ with limited capabilities. You can read more about Teams and its prerequisites here: [Welcome to Teams](teams-overview.md).
