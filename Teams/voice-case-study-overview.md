## Contoso business goals for Teams

To migrate their on-premises users to Teams for unified communication, collaboration, and voice, Contoso decided on the following business goals:

- Teams enablement 

  Contoso's unified communication and collaboration team enabled Teams with the correct policies to govern and enable secure internal and external collaboration. 

- Skype for Business to Teams upgrade 

  Skype for Business was widely deployed within Contoso. With the need to move off legacy systems, Contoso decided to upgrade their Skype for Business users to Teams. For more information, see [Contoso case study: Teams upgrade plan](voice-case-study-migration-plan.md).

- Phone System  

  Skype for Business with enterprise voice was widely deployed within Contoso. With the need to move off legacy systems that were the next hop for their mediation servers, Contoso migrated their Skype for Business enterprise voice users to Phone System. Contoso sites used Microsoft Calling Plan, Phone System Direct Routing, or a combination of both. For more information, see [Contoso case study: Phone System](voice-case-study-phone-system.md).

- Location-Based Routing 

  With office locations in telephony-regulated countries/regions, Contoso needed to recreate the Location-Based Routing that was present in Skype for Business in their Phone System deployment. For more information, see [Contoso case study: Location-Based Routing](voice-case-study-location-based-routing.md).

- Emergency Calling 

  Where Direct Routing was implemented, Contoso set up emergency calling with approved third parties. For more information, see [Contoso case study: Emergency Calling](voice-case-study-emergency-calling.md).

- Audio Conferencing 

  Contoso set up Audio Conferencing service numbers that were hosted on their SIP trunk to their PSTN provider. For more information, see [Contoso case study: Audio Conferencing](voice-case-study-audio-conferencing.md). 

- Local Media Optimization 

  Contoso took advantage of Local Media Optimization in locations where they had one direct route trunk to Microsoft Phone System that was leveraged by remote sites. For more information, see [Plan for Local Media Optimization](direct-routing-media-optimization.md) and [Configure Local Media Optimization](direct-routing-media-optimization-configure.md).

- Auto Attendants and Call Queues

  Contoso wanted to provide receptionist support while their staff was working remotely. Contoso used auto attendants and call queues to manage incoming calls to their receptionist's phone number. For more information, see [Contoso case study: Auto Attendants and Call Queues](voice-case-study-call-queues.md).
