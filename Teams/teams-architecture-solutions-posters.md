# Microsoft Teams IT architecture and voice solutions posters

This series of illustrations provides a view into the logical architecture of productivity services for enterprise architects.

## Microsoft voice solutions

This poster helps you decide which Microsoft voice solution (Phone System in the cloud or Enterprise Voice on-premises) is right for users in your organization, and how your organization can connect to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).
