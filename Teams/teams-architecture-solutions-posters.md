## Microsoft telephony solutions

Microsoft supports several options as you begin your journey to Teams in the Microsoft cloud. This poster helps you decide which Microsoft telephony solution (Phone System in the cloud or Enterprise Voice on-premises) is right for users in your organization, and how your organization can connect to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).
