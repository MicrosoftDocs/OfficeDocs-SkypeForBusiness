In terms of Teams **core** functionalities, there are no differences between the different Office 365 subscriptions, the availability of the compliance capabilities does rely on the correct subscription level. (See [Information Protection Licensing](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Plan-for-Office-365-security-and-information-protection-capabilities-3d4ac4a1-3920-4ff9-918f-011f3ce60408) for more information.)

All supported subscription plans are eligible for access to the Teams web client, desktop clients, and mobile apps.

Teams is not available as a standalone service.

Teams license
-------------

By default, the Teams license is enabled for all users with eligible Office 365 subscriptions.

Teams can be turned on or off for an entire license type within an organization and is turned on by default for all licenses types with the exception of Guest users. **You can't turn on Teams for only part of a license type through this switch.** If an organization intends to operate a pilot of Teams with a selective set of users, while actively restricting access to Teams for other users, the Teams license switch must be enabled for the entire license sku, then disable the Microsoft Teams product license for that particular user.
