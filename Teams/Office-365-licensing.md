> [!NOTE]
> Teams is also available for non-profit organizations. Teams will begin rolling out for the US Government Cloud Community (GCC) on July 17 and be available for all eligible customers by the end of August 2018. We are working to bring Microsoft Teams to the other US government clouds (GCC High and DoD) coming soon. Read more in the Microsoft Teams blog [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-Teams-Blog/Microsoft-Teams-will-be-available-July-17-for-the-US-Government/ba-p/209976).

> [!NOTE]
> Starting October 1, 2018, new Office 365 customers with 500 seats or less will be onboarded to Teams and will not have access to Skype for Business Online. Tenants that are already using Skype for Business Online will be able to continue doing so (including provisioning new users) until they complete their transition to Teams. To learn more, see [Microsoft Teams now the primary client for meetings and calling in Office 365](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4465277/microsoft-teams-now-the-primary-client-for-meetings-and-calling).
        
In terms of Teams core functionalities, there are no differences between the  Office 365 subscriptions. The availability of the compliance capabilities does rely on the correct subscription level. To learn more, read [Overview of security and compliance in Teams](security-compliance-overview.md). For a detailed list of features available in each subscription, see the [Office 365 Platform Service Description](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/office-365-platform-service-description.aspx).

**Cloud voice features**: For Audio Conferencing, your organization will need to buy and assign an Audio Conferencing license to each user who will be setting up dial-in meetings. For Calling Plans, each user will need a Phone System plus a Domestic or Domestic and International Calling Plan. To learn more, see [Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing).

All supported subscription plans are eligible for access to the Teams web client, desktop clients, and mobile apps.

Teams isn't available as a standalone service.
