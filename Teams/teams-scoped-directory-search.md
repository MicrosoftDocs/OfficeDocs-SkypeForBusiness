# Limit who users can see when searching the directory in Teams

Microsoft Teams lets organizations provide custom views of the directory to their users. These views can be useful if:

- Your organization has multiple companies within its tenant that you want to keep separate.
- Your business policies require that you prevent certain groups within your organization from communicating with each other.
- Your school wants to limit chats between faculty and students.

There are two options for limiting who users can see when they search the directory in Teams:

- [Information barriers in Microsoft Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/information-barriers-in-teams)
- [Address book policies in Exchange Online](/exchange/address-books/address-book-policies/address-book-policies)

If using either option, you must turn on search by name in the Teams admin center.

We recommend using information barriers if your organization meets the [required licenses and permissions](/microsoft-365/compliance/information-barriers#required-licenses-and-permissions).

To turn on search by name

1. In the Microsoft Teams admin center, select **Teams** > **Teams settings**.

1. Under **Search by name**, next to **Scope directory search using an Exchange address book policy**, turn the toggle **On**.

> [!Note]
> It may take a few hours for this change to take effect.
> 
> Turning on search by name hides the **Search teams** box and public teams listing in **Join or create a team** in Teams. It will also disable joining a team by typing `/join` in the command box at the top of Teams.
