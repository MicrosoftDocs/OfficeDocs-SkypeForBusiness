# Microsoft Teams Public Preview

> [!NOTE]
> Features included in preview might not be complete, and might undergo changes before becoming available in the public release. They're provided for evaluation and exploration purposes only.

Public Preview for Microsoft Teams provides early access to unreleased features in Teams. Previews allow you to explore and test upcoming features. We also welcome feedback on any feature in public previews. Public preview is enabled each Teams user, so you don't need to worry about affecting your entire organization.

## Set the Update policy

 Public preview is enabled for each user, and the option to turn on public preview is controlled in an admin policy. Update policies are used to manage Teams and Office preview users who will see pre-release or preview features in the Teams app. You can use the Global (Org-wide default) policy and customize it, or create one or more custom policies for your users.

1. Sign in to the admin center.
2. Select **Teams**>**Update policies**.

4. Name the update policy, add a description, and turn on **Show preview features**.

To enable the public preview on a desktop or web client, you need to do the following tasks:

1. Select your profile to display the Teams menu.
2. Select **About** â†’ **Public preview**.
3. Select **Switch to Public preview**.
