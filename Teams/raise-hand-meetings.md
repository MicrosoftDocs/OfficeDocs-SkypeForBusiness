# Raise your hand option in Teams meetings

During a Microsoft Teams meeting, a participant can use the **Raise your hand** option to get the speaker's and moderator's attention.

This feature is important for the following reasons:

- Participants can signal that they want to talk without disrupting the meeting.

- The moderator or speaker can see if anyone in the meeting wants to talk.  

- **Raise your hand** makes meetings more inclusive by encouraging participation from participants.

- **Raise your hand** provides a simple, quick way to take a poll of meeting participants.

A Teams admin doesn't have to create a policy for the feature to appear in a meeting.

## Raise your hand display

**Raise your hand** is always available in any meeting you join and is supported on all clients except meeting room devices (at the moment).

- A raised hand is visible to all meeting participants and indicated by a hand icon.

- Raised hands are shown in the meeting stage, roster (sorted by duration), and when sharing content.

- The raised hand is displayed as yellow adjacent to a participant's name.

Once participants has been acknowledged, they can use the **Lower your hand** option. Meeting presenters can also lower a participant's hand.
