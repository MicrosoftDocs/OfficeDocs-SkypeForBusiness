# Plan for Teams town halls

**APPLIES TO:** ✖️Meetings ✖️Webinars ✔️Town halls

 Microsoft Teams town halls bring interactive video streaming to a new level. Town halls are meant for one-to-many communications where the organizers or co-organizers are leading the interactions. The audience participation is primarily to view and react to the content being shared.

## Recordings and publishing

For town hall recordings, organizers have the ability to:

- Quickly publish a recording with all the right permissions set
- Modify the published recording

By default, recordings start once the town hall begins. Your users can change this setting in their meeting options for town halls.

As an admin, you control which types of town halls can have their recordings published.

## Turning off town halls

Town halls are enabled by default. If you'd like to disable town halls for users in your organization, see [Set up town halls](set-up-town-halls.md).

## eCDN

An Enterprise Content Delivery Network (eCDN) takes the video content from the internet and distributes the content throughout your enterprise without impacting network performance. If organizers in your organization have a Teams Premium subscription, they must use the Microsoft first-party eCDN solution with town halls. For organizers with all other Teams subscriptions, you can enable them to use the Microsoft first-party eCDN solution or, alternatively, one of the following certified eCDN partners to optimize your network for town halls held within your organization:

- [Hive](https://www.hivestreaming.com/partners/integration-partners/microsoft/)
- [Kollective](https://kollective.com/ecdn-solutions/microsoft-live-events/)
- [Ramp](https://rampecdn.com/)
- [Riverbed](https://www.riverbed.com/solutions/office-365.html)

For more information about the Microsoft eCDN, see [Introduction to Microsoft eCDN](/ecdn/intro).

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft first-party eCDN solution is the default and only option for Premium users.

## Attendee interaction

Attendees don't use their cameras or microphones during town halls. Instead, attendees interact and engage through **Q&A**. As an admin, you can manage which organizers can turn on Q&A for meetings and town halls.

## External participants

External attendees can join a town hall if it’s set to public only.

## Premium town halls

With a Teams premium license, your users have access to extended capabilities. The following table shows a comparison of capabilities between standard and premium town halls.
