# Plan for Teams town halls

**APPLIES TO:** ✖️Meetings ✖️Webinars ✔️Town halls

 Microsoft Teams town halls bring interactive video streaming to a new level. This event format is meant for one-to-many communications where the town hall organizer or co-organizer is leading the interactions. In town halls, the audience participation is primarily to view and react to the content being shared. Town halls encourage community throughout the entire engagement lifecycle with attendees before, during, and after each experience.

## Recordings and publishing

For town hall recordings, organizers have the ability to:

- Quickly publish a recording with all the right permissions set
- Dynamically check at video load time if a user has permissions to the file
- Modify the published recording
- Ensure the meeting chat and meeting details link to the recording are correct and work for all town hall attendees

As an admin, you control which types of town halls can have their recordings published.

## Streaming

**Town halls have Attendees, by default, set to stream mode? Premium Streaming attendee overflow?... need more details on this area

## eCDN

An eCDN (Enterprise Content Delivery Network) takes the video content from the internet and distributes the content throughout your enterprise without impacting network performance. If you and your users have a Teams Premium subscription, you must use the Microsoft first-party eCDN solution with town halls.
For all other Teams subscriptions, you can use the Microsoft first-party eCDN solution or, alternatively, one of the following certified eCDN partners to optimize your network for town halls held within your organization:

- [Hive](https://www.hivestreaming.com/partners/integration-partners/microsoft/)
- [Kollective](https://kollective.com/ecdn-solutions/microsoft-live-events/)
- [Ramp](https://rampecdn.com/)
- [Riverbed](https://www.riverbed.com/solutions/office-365.html)

For more information about the Microsoft eCDN, see [Introduction to Microsoft eCDN](/ecdn/intro).

## Attendee interaction

Attendees don't use their cameras or microphones during town halls. Instead, attendees interact and engage through:

- **Q&A**: You can manage which organizers can turn on Q&A for meetings and town halls.
- Polls
- **Reactions and hand raise**: You can manage which organizers have reactions available for attendees to use during their meetings and town halls.
