# New Teams for the Mac: Known issues 

>[!Note]
> The features described in this article are available to [**Teams Public preview**](/microsoftteams/public-preview-doc-updates) and [**Microsoft 365 Targeted release**](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/release-options-in-office-365?view=o365-worldwide#targeted-release) customers only. Features and content are subject to change. Check back for updates.


### Offline

**Issue**: Offline message edits, delete, and reactions functionality is currently not supported.</br>
**Workaround:**  Users can still send messages offline in new Teams for Mac.  However for full functionality, use classic Teams.

### Meeting Join

**Issue**: Users aren't muted despite the tooltip message that says they are.  In large meetings of over 600+ attendees the microphone was still active. </br>
**Workaround:**  Manually mute the call.

**Issue:**  During call transfer, if the call ends prematurely then the banner is not updated correctly.</br>
**Workaround:**  Being investigated. No current workaround.
