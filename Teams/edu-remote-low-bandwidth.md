# Troubleshoot low-bandwidth scenarios for Teams

This article will give IT admins the best practices when dealing with low-bandwidth issues in Teams.

Numerous network elements can affect performance when working with Microsoft Teams.

- Low-speed internet connection for the school.
- Low-speed internet connection for one or more students.
- Times of the day when there's low bandwidth because of network usage in an area.
- Outages not local to the school or students, but affect performance.
- Issues with hardware that cause low-bandwidth issues.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Read [How Microsoft Teams uses memory](teams-memory-usage-perf.md) for resource limitations on devices.

>For Teams network guidance, see [Prepare your organization's network for Microsoft Teams](prepare-network.md).

## Resolving low-bandwidth issues for IT admins

Some issues may only resolve with a narrow focus at the individual user level.

If bandwidth issues occur for many users or if actions taken at the user level haven't been helpful, school-wide action is the next step.

> [!NOTE]
> You may also read the [Quality of Experience Review Guide](quality-of-experience-review-guide.md). It's not EDU-specific but has valuable information.

### Meetings and video

Consider the actions below when dealing with meeting issues related to low network bandwidth.

#### Meeting video policies

Teams automatically scales meeting quality to a user's detected bandwidth. However, you can set further restrictions to preserve bandwidth.

Some restrictions you can set via policy include:

- Turning off video altogether so no one can use video.
- Limiting the media bit rate, which is set per-user.

For more policies you should set for meetings and video, read [Meeting policy settings in Teams: Audio and video](meeting-policies-audio-and-video.md).

#### Screen sharing policies

In Teams, users can share their entire screen or individual windows.

Sharing an entire screen uses more bandwidth than just sharing a window.

- Restrict users from sharing their entire screen via policy.
- Instruct educators to only share applications, not their entire screen.

Learn about screen sharing policies at [Meeting policy settings in Teams: Audio and video](meeting-policies-audio-and-video.md).

#### Dial-in number for meetings

It may be easier for some students to dial in to classroom sessions.

- Provide a dial-in number for Teams meetings as an alternative to attending a video meeting.

For more information, read [Set the phone numbers included on invites in Microsoft Teams](set-the-phone-numbers-included-on-invites-in-teams.md).

## Low-bandwidth scenarios as an educator

Having educators troubleshoot bandwidth issues may be a better choice than IT action in the following situations:

- The problem is intermittent.
- There's a specific time of the day you can anticipate there being an issue.

For steps an educator can take to resolve bandwidth issues, read [Use Teams for school work when bandwidth is low](https://support.office.com/article/use-teams-for-schoolwork-when-bandwidth-is-low-5c5675f7-1b55-471a-9daa-ec1e6df38262).

## Low-bandwidth scenarios as a parent or student

Sometimes the bandwidth problem is on a student's side.

- Their home may not have access to high bandwidth.
- They may have many people in their immediate area also consuming bandwidth.
- There may be internet instability.

We've put together guidance in our [Use Teams for school work when bandwidth is low](https://support.office.com/article/use-teams-for-schoolwork-when-bandwidth-is-low-5c5675f7-1b55-471a-9daa-ec1e6df38262) article for parents and students.
