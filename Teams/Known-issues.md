### For all Teams customers

|---------|---------|
|**New to Teams?**    |Check out [Get Started with Microsoft Teams](get-started-with-teams-quick-start.md).         |
|**Enable Teams guest access**     |Review the [Teams guest access checklist](guest-access-checklist.md) and make sure all steps are completed. See the following additional resources:<ul><li>[Understanding Guest Access in Microsoft Teams](guest-access.md)</li>[How a guest joins a Team](guest-joins.md) <li>[Setup – Microsoft Teams Guest Access Checklist](guest-access-checklist.md)</li></ul>|
|**Teams meetings and dial-in**    |Need help turning on or setting up Audio Conferencing in Teams? Has this user been recently created?

|**Teams Exploratory License**     |The Microsoft Teams Exploratory experience lets users in your organization who have Azure Active Directory (AAD) and are not licensed for Teams initiate an exploratory experience of Teams. Admins can switch this feature on or off for users in their organization. The earlier [Microsoft Commercial Cloud Trial](iw-trial-teams.md) is now replaced by The Teams Exploratory experience. <br><br>Additional resources:<ul><li>[How users sign up for the Teams Exploratory experience](teams-exploratory.md#how-users-sign-up-for-the-teams-exploratory-experience)</li><li>[Manage the Teams Exploratory experience](teams-exploratory.md#manage-the-teams-exploratory-experience)</li></ul>|
|**Private channels**    |Private channels in Microsoft Teams create focused spaces for collaboration within your teams. Only the users on the team who are owners or members of the private channel can access the channel. Anyone, including guests, can be added as a member of a private channel as long as they are already members of the team.<br><br>You might want to use a private channel if you want to limit collaboration to those who have a need to know or if you want to facilitate communication between a group of people assigned to a specific project, without having to create an additional team to manage.<br><br>Additional resources:<ul><li>[How users sign up for the Teams Exploratory experience](teams-exploratory.md#how-users-sign-up-for-the-teams-exploratory-experience)</li><li>[Manage the Teams Exploratory experience](teams-exploratory.md#manage-the-teams-exploratory-experience)</li><ul>        |
|**Meeting policies**|[Meeting policies](meeting-policies-in-teams.md) are used to control the features that are available to meeting participants for meetings that are scheduled by users in your organization. After you create a policy and make your changes, you can then assign users to the policy.         |
||**Change or create a meeting policy**<br><br>To change or create a meeting policy, go to the Microsoft Teams admin center > **Meetings** > **Meeting policies**. Select a policy from the list or select **Add**. If you're creating a new policy, add a name and description. The name can't contain special characters or be longer than 64 characters. Choose your settings, and then click **Save**. For example, say you have a bunch of users and you want to limit the amount of bandwidth that their meeting would require. You would create a new custom policy named "Limited bandwidth" and disable the following settings:<br><br>Under **Audio & video**:<ul><li>Turn off Allow cloud recording.</li><li>Turn off Allow IP video.</li></ul>Under **Content sharing**:<ul><li>Disable screen sharing mode.</li><li>Turn off Allow whiteboard.</li><li>Turn off Allow shared notes.</li></ul>Then assign the policy to the users.         |
| |**Assign a meeting policy to users**<br><br><ol><li>In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Users**, and then click the user.</li><li>Select the user by clicking to the left of the user name, and then click **Edit settings**.</li><li>Under **Meeting policy**, select the policy you want to assign, and then click **Apply**.</li></ol>To assign a policy to multiple users at a time, see [Edit Teams user settings in bulk](edit-user-settings-in-bulk.md). Or you can do the following:<ol><li>In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Meetings > Meeting policies**.</li><li>Select the policy by clicking to the left of the policy name.</li><li>Select **Manage users**.</li><li>In the **Manage users** pane, search for the user by display name or by user name, select the name, and then click **Add**. Repeat this step for each user that you want to add.</li><li>After you finish adding users, click **Save**.</li>         |
|**Troubleshoot a missing dial pad**     |Do the following: <ul><li>Make sure the user has been assigned a [Teams license](assign-teams-licenses.md).</li><li>Make sure the user has a [Calling Plan](calling-plan-landing-page.md) assigned.</li><li>Enable the user for [Enterprise Voice](https://docs.microsoft.com/skypeforbusiness/skype-for-business-hybrid-solutions/plan-your-phone-system-cloud-pbx-solution/enable-users-for-enterprise-voice-online-and-phone-system-voicemail#to-enable-your-users-for-phone-system-in-office-365-voice-and-voicemail).</li></ul>      |
|**Troubleshoot Teams sign-in**   |First, make sure the [Microsoft Teams service is healthy](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?source=applauncher#/servicehealth). Then check for any common error codes and review [Why am I having trouble signing in to Microsoft Teams?](https://support.office.com/article/a02f683b-61a3-4008-9447-ee60c5593b0f)  You may also need to review [Identity models and authentication in Microsoft Teams](identify-models-authentication.md).         |

|Your users are seeing a "You're missing out!" message.   |Be sure to [Enable Microsoft Teams for your school](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/education/intune-edu-trial/enable-microsoft-teams). In EDU tenants, Teams isn't enabled by default; you'll have to turn it on first. <br><br>Next, review [Remote teaching and learning in Office 365 Education](https://support.office.com/article/remote-teaching-and-learning-in-office-365-education-f651ccae-7b65-478b-8366-51bb884025c4) to learn the most up-to-date guidance on setting up your school, lesson planning, meeting virtually, and sharing content with students.<br><br>Finally, be sure to check out Microsoft Teams IT admin training videos, decks, and a lot more at [Admin training for Teams](itadmin-readiness.md).        |

|Microsoft Teams will always log into the Domain-joined PC account.   <br/> |If a user has two different Teams accounts and has a machine with domain-joined enabled, Teams will use the domain-joined profile on the machine to automatically log the user into Teams. To switch to the other Teams account, the user must manually log out of the app and enter credentials to the second account to log in. If the user logs out of Teams and restarts the machine, upon restart, Teams will automatically log in using the domain-joined profile. <br/> | If users are signed in to a domain-joined computer and you don't want their user name pre-populated on the Teams sign-in screen, admins can set the following Windows registry to turn off pre-population of the user name (UPN) Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\Teams SkipUpnPrefill(REG_DWORD) 0x00000001 (1). Note Skipping user name pre-fill for user names that end in ".local" or ".corp" is on by default, so you don't need to set a registry key to turn these off.

To enter a meeting, click the **Join** button. <br/> While we are continuing development in this area, if this meeting was scheduled with Skype for Business and you click **Join**, Microsoft Teams will launch your Skype for Business client to complete your entrance into the meeting. Meetings scheduled within Microsoft Teams will initiate directly within the product.  <br/> In the future, we will streamline this experience.  <br/> |Click **Join**. Microsoft Teams will intelligently decide whether Skype for Business is required for a user to join the meeting based on the URL included in the meeting description.  <br/> |3/13/17  <br/> |
