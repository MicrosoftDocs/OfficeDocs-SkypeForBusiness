# Known issues for Microsoft Teams

This article lists the known issues for Microsoft Teams, by feature area.

## Administration



|**Issue title**|**Behavior / Symptom**|**Known workaround**|**Discovery date**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Audit logs may report an incorrect username as initiator when someone has been removed from a Team  <br/> |Teams team is a modern group in AAD. When you add/remove a member through the Teams user interface, the flow knows exactly which user initiated the change, and the Audit log reflects the correct info. However, if a user adds/removes a member through AAD, the change is synced to the Teams backend without telling Teams who initiated the action. Microsoft Teams picks the first owner of team as the initiator, which is eventually reflected in the Audit log as well.    <br/> |  <br/> |5/11/18  <br/> |

|**Issue title**|**Behavior / Symptom**|**Known workaround**|**Discovery date**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|EAF policy in the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can incorrectly identify Chromium sandbox optimizations as threats. <br/> |There is an issue with Chromium sandbox in which the Export Address Table Access Filtering (EAF) policy in the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) and in Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) can incorrectly identify Chromium sandbox optimizations as threats. This causes Teams to not work properly.  <br/> | To work around this issue turn off EAF for Teams. You can read more about the issue [EMET mitigations guidelines](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2909257/emet-mitigations-guidelines) For more information about Windows Defender ATP and EAF policy, see [Customize exploit protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/customize-exploit-protection) <br/> |10/11/18 <br/> |

|**Issue title**|**Behavior / Symptom**|**Known workaround**|**Discovery date**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Unable to add members to teams when UsersPermissionToReadOtherUsersEnabled is set to false  <br/> |When this value is set to false in AAD, customer is unable to add external/internal members in Microsoft Teams, and the following error message is displayed: "We couldn't add member. We ran into an issue. Please try again later." However, members can be added directly to Office 365 groups.    <br/> |Change this setting to true in AAD.  <br/> |4/10/18  <br/> |

|**Issue title**|**Behavior / Symptom**|**Known workaround**|**Discovery date**|

|When you try to join Teams from Internet Explorer or Edge, the program consistently loops or crashes and doesn't sign in.   <br/> | Your organization utilizes Trusted Sites in Internet Explorer and the Teams web-based application does not correctly log in because trusted sites for Teams are not allowed. <br/>|Make the following changes to IE settings or from the Control Panel, either with Administrator rights or a Group Policy Object:<br/><ol><li>Under **Internet Options** &gt; **Privacy** &gt; **Advanced**, accept First-Party and Third-Party cookies, and check the box for **Always allow session cookies**.</li><li>Click **Internet Options** &gt; **Security** &gt; **Trusted Sites** &gt; **Sites**, and add all of the following:<ul><li>https://login.microsoftonline.com</li><li>https://\*.teams.microsoft.com</li></ul></li></ol><br/><b>NOTE</b>: Always validate and allow all trusted URLs for Teams and the requirements from the following document: [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges).   <br/> |11/1/17  <br/> |

|Audit logs may report an incorrect username as initiator when someone has been removed from a Team  <br/> |Teams team is a modern group in AAD. When you add/remove a member through the Teams user interface, the flow knows exactly which user initiated the change, and the Audit log reflects the correct info. However, if a user adds/removes a member through AAD, the change is synced to the Teams backend without telling Teams who initiated the action. Microsoft Teams picks the first owner of team as the initiator, which is eventually reflected in the Audit log as well.    <br/> |  <br/> |5/11/18  <br/> |
