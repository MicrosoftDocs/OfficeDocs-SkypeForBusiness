# Use OneDrive and SharePoint for meeting recordings

When users in your org record Teams meetings, they're stored in OneDrive and SharePoint. The video plays on the video player of OneDrive or SharePoint depending on where your users access the file. This article helps you, as an admin, understand recording storage and permissions for OneDrive and Sharepoint.

To learn about blocking the download of Teams meeting recording files from SharePoint or OneDrive, see [Block the download of Teams meeting recording files from SharePoint or OneDrive](block-download-meeting-recording.md).

## Recording storage

By default, all recording files go to the OneDrive account of the user who selected **Record**. For channel meetings, the recording always goes to the SharePoint site of the channel. **As an admin, you can't change where the recording is stored.**

For **non-Channel meetings**, the recording is stored in a folder named **Recordings** that's at the top level of the OneDrive that belongs to the person who started the meeting recording. For example, *recorder's OneDrive*/**Recordings**.

For **Channel meetings**, the recording is stored in the Teams site documentation library in a folder named **Recordings**. For example: *Teams name - Channel name*/**Documents**/**Recordings**.

If a Teams meeting recording fails to successfully upload to OneDrive because the user doesn't have OneDrive or SharePoint, or the storage quota is full, a "The recording ended unexpectedly" error message appears. The recording is instead temporarily saved to async media storage. Once the recording is in async media storage, no retry attempts are made to automatically upload the recording to OneDrive or SharePoint. During that time, the organizer must download the recording. If not downloaded within 21 days, the recording is deleted.

Since videos are just like any other file in OneDrive and SharePoint, handling ownership and retention after an employee leaves follows the normal [OneDrive and SharePoint process](/onedrive/retention-and-deletion).

To learn how to apply retention labels to Teams meeting recordings, see [How to auto-apply a retention label](/microsoft-365/compliance/apply-retention-labels-automatically).

## Viewing permissions

For **non-Channel meetings**, all meeting invitees, except for external participants, automatically get a personally shared link. The meeting organizer or the person who started the meeting recording must explicitly add external participants to the shared list.

For **Channel meetings**, permissions are inherited from the owners and members list in the channel.

## Recording quotas

Teams meeting recording files live in OneDrive and SharePoint and are included in your quota for those services. To learn more, see
[SharePoint quota](/sharepoint/sites/plan-site-maintenance-and-management#quotas), [Sharepoint limits](/office365/servicedescriptions/sharepoint-online-service-description/sharepoint-online-limits), and [OneDrive quota](/onedrive/set-default-storage-space).

## Managing captions

Captions help create inclusive content for viewers of all abilities. Closed captions for Teams meeting recordings are available during playback only if the user had transcription turned on at the time of recording. Admins must turn on transcription to ensure their users can record meetings with transcription. To learn more about enabling transcription for your users, see [Admins- Manage transcription and captions for Teams meetings](meeting-transcription-captions.md).

As an owner, you can hide captions on the meeting recording, although the meeting transcript is available on Teams unless you delete it there.

Closed captions are supported for Teams meeting recordings for 60 days from when the meeting is recorded. Closed captions aren't fully supported if the Teams Meeting Recording is moved or copied from its original location on OneDrive or SharePoint.

## Permissions or role-based access

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that the recipient is required to be a logged-in user when sharing Teams meeting recordings. Select the **People in (Your Organization)** option when you share the file as documented in [Share SharePoint files or folders](https://support.microsoft.com/office/1fe37332-0f9a-4719-970e-d2578da4941c). External sharing isn't designed for the distribution of large files or a large number of files.
