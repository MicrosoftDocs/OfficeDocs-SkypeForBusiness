# Considerations for Teams Phone Mobile

This article describes considerations for emergency calling for Teams Phone Mobile users. Before reading the rest of this article, make sure you've reviewed critical emergency calling concepts and definitions in [Plan and manage emergency calling](what-are-emergency-locations-addresses-and-call-routing.md).

To find out whether Teams Phone Mobile is the right solution for your business, see [PSTN connectivity options](pstn-connectivity.md) and [Plan for Teams Phone Mobile](operator-connect-mobile-plan.md).

## Emergency call enablement for Teams Phone Mobile

Each Teams Phone Mobile user is automatically enabled for emergency calling. Emergency calls are routed automatically to the Teams Phone Mobile carrier for a given number.

The ability for a tenant admin to set the registered address for a Teams Phone Mobile user will depend upon the capabilities assigned to the number when the carrier uploads them into a customer's inventory. Based upon this setting, the tenant administrator may or may not be required—or able—to set, modify, or delete the emergency location of a user.

When calls made through the native dialer of the SIM-enabled smartphone, your operator may use the geographic coordinates or cell tower handling the call to approximate emergency location for assistance.

## Dynamic emergency calling for Teams Phone Mobile

Dynamic emergency calling for Teams Phone Mobile provides the capability to configure and route emergency calls based on the current location of the Teams client. The ability to do automatic routing to the appropriate Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) or to notify security desk personnel varies depending on the country/region of usage of the Teams user.

Dynamic location for routing emergency calls is supported in the United States as follows.

- If a Teams client for a United States user dynamically acquires an emergency address within the United States, that address is used for emergency routing instead of the registered address, and the call will be automatically routed to the PSAP in the serving area of the address.

- If a Teams client for a United States user doesn't dynamically acquire an emergency address within the United States, then the registered emergency address is used to help screen and route the call. However, the call will be screened to determine if an updated address is required before connecting the caller to the appropriate PSAP.

Dynamic location for routing emergency calls is supported in Canada the same as in the United States with the following exceptions: all emergency calls will be screened nationally before transferred to the PSAP.

For more information, see [Plan and configure dynamic emergency calling](configure-dynamic-emergency-calling.md).

## Emergency call routing for Teams Phone Mobile

When a Teams Teams Phone Mobile user dials an emergency number using a Microsoft Teams client, how the call is routed to the PSAP depends on the following:

- Whether the emergency address is dynamically determined by the Teams client

- Whether the emergency address is the registered address associated with the user's phone number

- The emergency calling network of that country/region

- In the United States and Canada, dynamic routing is part of the carrier's service. You don't need to procure this service from another service provider.

- If a Teams client is located at a tenant-defined dynamic emergency location:
  - In the United States, emergency calls from that client are automatically routed to the PSAP serving that geographic location.
  - In Canada, all emergency calls will be screened by a national call center before transferring the call to the PSAP serving that geographic location.

- If a Teams client is not located at a tenant-defined dynamic emergency location, emergency calls from that client are screened by a national call center to determine the location of the caller before transferring the call to the PSAP serving that geographic location.

- If an emergency caller is unable to update their emergency location to the screening center, the call will be transferred to the PSAP serving the caller's registered address.

Your mobile operator manages all emergency calls made through your SIM-Enabled Smartphone’s native dialer and may use multiple technologies to approximate emergency location for assistance like geographic coordinates or which cell towers are handling the call etc. Please reach out to your operator for more information.
