# Create a custom team template in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE [preview-feature](includes/preview-feature.md)]

**Custom templates are not yet supported for EDU customers.**

A custom team template is a predefined team structure with a set of channels, tabs, and apps that you can develop to help you create the right collaboration space quickly. Your custom team template uses your preferred settings.  

To get started:

1. Log in to the Teams admin center.

2. In the left navigation, expand **Teams** > **Team templates**.

3. Click **Add**.
