# Change the default language for greetings and emails

If you are a [Global Admin](https://support.office.com/article/da585eea-f576-4f55-a1e0-87090b6aaa9d), you can set up Skype for Business Online or Microsoft Teams to play its default voicemail greeting in another language. The default system greeting is something like, "Please leave a message for John Smith. After the tone, please record your message. When you finish recording, hang up, or press the pound key for more options."
  
 **First, read this important info:**
  
- **The languages that are available to you are determined by the location of your organization**. For example, if your organization is located in the United States, you can set the default language to English or Spanish. If your organization is located in Canada, you can choose between English and French. For a list of supported languages in Teams and Skype for Business, see the following:
  - [Microsoft Teams supported languages](languages-for-voicemail-greetings-and-messages.md)
  - [Skype for Business supported languages](./Skype/SfbOnline/what-is-phone-system-in-office-365/phone-system-voicemail/languages-for-voicemail-greetings-and-messages.md)

- **Changing languages for individual user's voicemail greeting and voicemail messages.** You can change the preferred language for users, which will change the language of their voicemail greeting and voicemail messages sent to their Outlook mailbox. For more information, see [How to set language and region settings for Office 365](/office365/troubleshoot/access-management/set-language-and-region).

  > [!NOTE]
  > Users can change their own greeting language through their settings after they sign in.
