# Skype for Business Online retirement

In July 2019, we announced **Skype for Business Online will be retired on July 31, 2021,** giving our customers two years to plan their transitions to Microsoft Teams, the hub for teamwork in Microsoft 365. With less than a year remaining, we want to ensure customers have the information and resources they need to plan and execute a successful upgrade to Teams.
 
## Why is Skype for Business Online retiring?

Since its introduction, Skype for Business Online has been a valuable tool for millions of people around the world. By combining instant messaging, calling, and video into one application, Skype for Business Online established new possibilities for business communications. Microsoft Teams is the next chapter in that vision.

The capabilities of Microsoft Teams go beyond those of Skype for Business Online. By combining chat, video, calling, document collaboration, and application integration into a single experience, Teams enables entirely news way of working. And ongoing platform innovation and development means Teams users benefit from richer performance, functionality, flexibility, and security.

Teams isn’t just an upgrade for Skype for Business Online, it’s a powerful tool that enables companies, schools, and organizations to become more agile and improve the efficiency of key workflows. Learn more about the potential benefits of Teams for your organization in the Forrester white paper, [The Total Economic Impact™ of Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Total-Economic-Impact-Microsoft-Teams.pdf?rtc=1).


## What does this mean for Skype for Business customers?

After Skype for Business Online retires on July 31, 2021, the service will no longer be accessible. Until then, current Skype for Business Online customers will experience no change in service and will be able to add new users as needed. As of September 1, 2019, all new Microsoft 365 customers have been onboarded directly to Teams for chat, meetings, and calling.

The time needed to fully transition to Teams will vary based upon the unique characteristics of the organization, including number of users, technical complexity, and internal adaptability to change. As such, we recommend planning your upgrade to Teams today, not only to ensure adequate time to execute a successful transition from Skype for Business, but to more quickly realize the benefits of Teams.

Teams is available in most Microsoft 365 Business and Enterprise plans, and your existing licensing investments carry forward to Teams. Capabilities that are premium workloads in Skype for Business Online today will continue to be premium workloads in Teams. For example, if you have purchased Audio Conferencing standalone or as part of E5 with Skype for Business, Audio Conferencing will be enabled in Teams.

The Skype consumer service and Skype for Business Server are not affected by the retirement of Skype for Business Online.

## Skype for Business Online retirement FAQs

Yes. Current Skype for Business Online customers may add new seats to their tenant with the understanding they will eventually need to transition these users to Microsoft Teams.

**What is the future of Skype for Business Server?**<br>
We recognize customers are using Skype for Business Server and many need to continue to use Skype for Business Server for some users or geographies due to their requirements. In these instances, we encourage organizations to adopt Teams along with Skype for Business Server to drive teamwork and collaboration. The latest version of Skype for Business Server 2019 was released in October 2018 with Mainstream Support planned through January 9, 2024.

**What does this mean for the Skype consumer service?**<br>
The retirement of Skype for Business Online will not impact the Skype consumer service.

**What does this mean for existing Microsoft 365 customers?**<br>
We've brought the key set of Skype for Business Online capabilities into Teams along with new voice, video, and meetings innovation. We encourage all Microsoft 365 customers to start using Teams today within their organization, independently or side by side with Skype for Business Online and/or Skype for Business Server.

**Will you continue to invest in improving Skype for Business Online?**<br>
We plan to support Skype for Business Online through the July 31, 2021 retirement date.

Customers seeking the latest functionality and performance are encouraged to upgrade to Microsoft Teams.

**What do you recommend for customers who are currently in the process of deploying — or planning to deploy — Skype for Business in Microsoft 365?**<br>
Customers currently deploying Skype for Business Online may continue to do so. We encourage all new Microsoft 365 customers to start using Teams, independently of or in parallel with Skype for Business and determine the path (coexistence or Teams Only) and timing that meets their business needs. Regardless of tenure with Skype for Business Online, customers will need to move to Teams before the Skype for Business Online retirement date.

**What does this mean from a licensing perspective? How will customers pay for Intelligent Communications services in Teams?**<br>
Teams is available in many of the Microsoft 365 suites. Capabilities that are premium workloads in Skype for Business Online today will continue to be premium workloads in Teams.

Currently, we have no plans to schedule upgrades for enterprise customers.
