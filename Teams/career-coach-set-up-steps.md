### Step 1: Prepare your Microsoft 365 tenant for Career Coach

#### Turn on LinkedIn account connections

There are two ways LinkedIn account connections are used by Career Coach:

- To allow students, faculty, and staff to connect their Microsoft 365 account to their LinkedIn account and [send LinkedIn invitations from Career Coach](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/career-coach-quick-start-guide-for-students-c419db47-9290-4961-9684-c3f86a9b3708#bkmk_connect_your_linkedin_account).
- To turn on the [Build your Network](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/career-coach-quick-start-guide-for-students-c419db47-9290-4961-9684-c3f86a9b3708#bkmk_build_your_network) and [Explore Careers](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/career-coach-quick-start-guide-for-students-c419db47-9290-4961-9684-c3f86a9b3708#bkmk_discover_your_career_path) features using public alumni data from LinkedIn.

To turn on LinkedIn account connections:

1. Sign into the [Azure AD admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2067268) with a [global admin account](#identify-roles-and-permissions) for the Azure AD organization.

2. Select **Users**.

3. On the **Users** page, select **User settings**.

4. **LinkedIn account connections** must be set to **Yes** or **Selected group** for Career Coach to be properly configured.

   - Select **Yes** to turn on the service for all users in your educational institution.
   - Select **Selected group** to turn on the service for only a group of selected users in your educational institution.

For more information, see [LinkedIn account connections in Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/linkedin-integration).

> [!NOTE]
> No data is shared without the user's consent.

#### Allow Microsoft apps in Teams

Career Coach is a Microsoft application, and so it must be allowed within Teams app permission policies.

1. Sign in to the **[Teams admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2066851)**.

2. In the left navigation, select **Teams apps** > **[Permission policies](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps)**.

3. Select your preferred policy.
    1. If you're unsure which policy to use, refer to the [Microsoft Teams Policy management documentation](policy-packages-edu.md) or use the [Education policy wizard](easy-policy-setup-edu.md) to configure a policy for Microsoft Teams.

Learn more about [configuring permission policies](teams-app-permission-policies.md).

#### Add Career Coach as an installed app

This step ensures Career Coach is properly configured for your institution and students can find Career Coach.

1. Sign into the [Teams admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2066851).

2. Select **Teams apps** > **Setup policies**, and select your preferred policy.
    1. If you're unsure which policy to use, refer to the [Microsoft Teams Policy management documentation](policy-packages-edu.md) or use the [Education policy wizard](easy-policy-setup-edu.md) to configure a policy for Microsoft Teams.

3. Under **Installed apps**, select **+ Add apps**.

4. In the **Add installed apps** pane, search for the apps you want to automatically install for users when they start Teams. You can also filter apps by app permission policy.

5. When you've chosen your list of apps, select **Add**.

6. Select **Save** > **Confirm**.

Editing or assigning a policy can take a few hours for changes to take effect. The Career Coach won't be available in Microsoft Teams until the changes are complete.

### Step 2: Purchase Career Coach licenses

#### License types

Career Coach requires a license to access the application.

There are two license types available.

- The **Student license** is designed for students.
- The **Faculty license** is designed for faculty, staff, and IT professionals involved in supporting students with Career Coach.
  - A Career Coach **Faculty license** must be assigned to the IT admin completing the configuration.

#### Purchase licenses

Career Coach is available worldwide (except China and Russia) for qualified higher education institutions as an add-on license through Enrollment for Education Solutions (EES), Cloud Service Providers (CSP), and Microsoft 365 admin center (web direct).

As a Microsoft Teams app, the tenant must have Microsoft 365 A3/A5 or Office 365 A1/A3/A5 to purchase the add-on Career Coach license. Separate licenses are offered for students and faculty users.

#### Sign up for a free trial

A standard 90-day free trial is available for 25 students and 25 faculty licenses. One trial is available per qualifying tenant. Trial licenses can be activated from Microsoft 365 admin center by tenants who are qualified to purchase Career Coach licenses.

For trial activation, sign into [Microsoft 365 admin center > Billing > Purchase services > search for Career Coach](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=868433) to find the [student license trial](https://signup.microsoft.com/signup?OfferId=b3a40ff2-3d0d-481e-a0ed-f4de1069f201) and [faculty license trial](https://signup.microsoft.com/signup?OfferId=6f6e7db5-b9ab-4baa-86be-f13d0ae6a2c8).

## Set up and configure Career Coach settings

1. [Step 3: Access the Career Coach app settings](#step-3-access-the-career-coach-app-settings).
1. [Step 4: Configure Career Coach settings](#step-4-configure-career-coach-settings).

### Step 3: Access the Career Coach app settings

To configure Career Coach settings and allow it for users, you must be a global admin or Teams service admin to access the page.

1. Sign into the [Teams admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2066851).
2. In the left navigation, select **Teams apps** > **Manage apps**.

### Step 4: Configure Career Coach settings

To set up Career Coach for students, faculty, and staff, the following settings are required.

- [Brand and preferences](#brand-and-preferences)
- [LinkedIn connection](#linkedin-connection)
- [Course catalog](#course-catalog)
- [Fields of study](#fields-of-study)

You can also set optional [Customization](#customization-options) settings.

#### Brand and preferences

Customize Career Coach to match your educational institution’s brand. You're responsible for respecting others' rights, including copyright and trademark rights.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a required section. Career Coach can't be turned on without **Brand and preferences** submitted.

1. Sign into the **[Teams admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2066851)**.

2. Select **Teams apps** > **Manage apps** > **Career Coach** > **Settings** > **Edit brand and preferences**.

3. Under **Branding**, add **Organization name**.

4. Upload the **Organization icon**. The icon is used throughout Career Coach to identify content unique to your educational institution, course catalog resources throughout the app, and on the real-world experiences section of the dashboard.

    The icon is best formatted as:

    - A transparent PNG
    - Aspect ratio of 1:1
    - Maximum size of 64 px x 64 px

5. Upload the **Learning content thumbnail image**. The thumbnail will be used for course catalog learning resources throughout the app when a specific image isn't specified for a course offered by your educational institution.

    The thumbnail is best formatted as:

    - A PNG
    - Aspect ratio of 16:9
    - Maximum size of 360 px x 200 px

6. This is an optional step. Add the **Organization privacy policy URL**. If added, the institution's privacy policy will be available for students to review in Career Coach.

7. Select **Submit**.

8. To confirm settings were submitted successfully, check [Career Coach configuration status](#configuration-status) for **Complete**.

![Screenshot that shows the Career Coach branding section of the admin center.](media/career-coach-brand-updated.png)

#### LinkedIn connection

The LinkedIn connection setting connects Career Coach with public alumni data from your institution’s LinkedIn School Page.

This step can only be completed if [LinkedIn account connections are enabled in Azure Active Directory](#turn-on-linkedin-account-connections). The LinkedIn connection setting turns on the [Build your Network](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/career-coach-quick-start-guide-for-students-c419db47-9290-4961-9684-c3f86a9b3708#bkmk_build_your_network) and [Explore Careers](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/career-coach-quick-start-guide-for-students-c419db47-9290-4961-9684-c3f86a9b3708#bkmk_discover_your_career_path) features.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a required section. Career Coach can't be turned on without the LinkedIn School Page connection verified.

##### Add the LinkedIn School Page URL

The process of adding the LinkedIn School Page URL is handled by a Teams Administrator. The subsequent step of verifying the URL is completed by your educational institution’s LinkedIn School Page Super admin.

1. Sign into the **[Teams admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2066851)**.

2. Select **Teams apps** > **Manage apps** > **Career Coach** > **Settings** > **LinkedIn connection**.

3. Select **Connect to LinkedIn**.

4. Find your institution's LinkedIn School Page by searching on LinkedIn and selecting the **School** filter. Or connect with a marketing staff member at your institution to determine the correct LinkedIn School Page to use. For more information, see [How to identify LinkedIn pages](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/40133/differences-between-a-linkedin-page-for-a-school-and-company?lang=en).

    ![Screenshot that shows the LinkedIn search for school.](media/career-coach-school-search-updated.png)

5. Add the **LinkedIn School Page URL**. The URL must be a *school page*, not a *company page*, and is typically formatted as `https://www.linkedin.com/school/willow-university/`.

   ![Screenshot that shows the LinkedIn School Page example.](media/career-coach-linkedin-page-url-updated.png)

6. Select **Submit**.

7. After the **LinkedIn School Page URL** is successfully submitted, the settings page will update to show the **Verification link** and **Verification link expiration**. The verification link expires after 30 days.

8. Copy the **Verification link** and share it with your educational institution’s LinkedIn School Page Super admin.

9. The LinkedIn School Page Super admin will use the unique verification link to [verify the LinkedIn School Page](#verify-the-linkedin-school-page) and associate it with Career Coach.

10. To confirm the verification and settings were submitted successfully, check that the [Career Coach configuration status](#configuration-status) is marked **Complete**.

##### Verify the LinkedIn School Page

The LinkedIn School Page verification must be completed by your educational institution’s [LinkedIn School Page Super admin](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a541981).

You can check your LinkedIn account’s admin roles by signing into LinkedIn and visiting your educational institution’s LinkedIn School Page. If your account is assigned a Super admin role, you'll see **Super admin view** listed next to your educational institution’s name on the LinkedIn page. If you don't see the **Super admin view** tag, then you're not a Super admin for your school’s page.

1. After the **LinkedIn School Page URL** is submitted by the Teams administrator, the page will show the **Verification link** and **Verification link expiration**. The verification link expires after 30 days.

   ![Screnshot that shows the LinkedIn connections for the career coach app.](media/career-coach-linkedin-updated.png)  

2. Copy the verification link and share it with your LinkedIn School Page Super admin.

3. The LinkedIn page Super admin will open the verification link to associate Career Coach with your school's page. For more information, see [Additional documentation about LinkedIn page verification](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/102672).

4. Once verification is complete, the Teams administrator can view whether the settings were submitted successfully by checking if the [Career Coach configuration status](#configuration-status) is marked **Complete**.

   ![Screenshot that shows the LinkedIn page verification in the LinkedIn developer portal.](media/career-coach-linkedin-verification-updated.png)

#### Course catalog

The course catalog records the courses and classes offered by your educational institution.

Career Coach uses course catalog data to identify a student’s skills from their transcript and to suggest courses to take.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a required section. Career Coach can't be turned on without a course catalog.

These courses are used within Career Coach in two areas:

- Courses are returned as part of [learning resources](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/career-coach-quick-start-guide-for-students-c419db47-9290-4961-9684-c3f86a9b3708#bkmk_grow_real_world_skills).  

- Courses and course metadata, like course titles and descriptions, are used to help students identify their skills when they [upload a transcript](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/career-coach-quick-start-guide-for-students-c419db47-9290-4961-9684-c3f86a9b3708#bkmk_Set_up_your_profile).

To create the course catalog, put together a list of all courses taught at your educational institution and upload it as a CSV file using the [course catalog document format and schema](#course-catalog-document-format-and-schema).

Start with the [sample course catalog](https://aka.ms/career-coach/docs/it-admins/sample-catalog) document to ensure proper formatting.  You can also reference the [course catalog document format and schema](#course-catalog-document-format-and-schema) sections for details on required and recommended fields.

2. Select **Teams apps** > **Manage apps** > Search **Career Coach** > **Settings** > **Course catalog**.

3. Select **Upload Course Catalog** > Upload courses in CSV format with the required columns: courseId, title, and sourceLink.
    1. Each row must include data for each of the required columns.
    1. *Including the recommended fields improves the experience for students by returning better search results and skill identification.*

4. A preview of a section of the uploaded course catalog will appear for your reference.

5. Select **Submit** when ready.

6. The [status of the uploaded document](#course-catalog-status) is shown in the settings page.

7. To confirm settings were submitted successfully, check that the [Career Coach configuration status](#configuration-status) is marked **Complete**.

To upload a new file, ensure the last file is cleared by selecting (X) to close the document preview. This action will allow the **Upload** button to display again.

![Screenshot that shows the course catalog section of the career coach app.](media/course-catalog-updated.png)

##### Course catalog document format and schema

The document needs to be in CSV format with a maximum size of 18 MB. Large files should be split into multiple smaller files that include a maximum of 15,000 rows for successful processing.

The document must contain the required course metadata: **course title**, **course ID**, and **course URL**.

Once all required steps are marked as complete, Career Coach can be successfully released to your tenant.

## Step 5: Make Career Coach available to your institution

At this point, Career Coach has been configured for your institution.

Next, follow these steps to ensure Career Coach is available to your institution in Microsoft Teams.

### Assign Career Coach licenses to users

For step-by-step instructions, see [Assign licenses to users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users).

### Set up policies and pin the app

Pinning Career Coach will add it to the left rail of the Microsoft Teams window to make it more accessible and visible for students. If you prefer to pin Career Coach for a subset of your users, then you'll need to implement a [Setup policy](teams-app-setup-policies.md) with that group included.

1. Sign into the **[Teams admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2066851)**.

2. Select **Teams apps** > **Setup policies** and select your preferred policy.

    If you're unsure which policy to use, refer to the [Microsoft Teams Policy management documentation](policy-packages-edu.md) or use the [Education policy wizard](easy-policy-setup-edu.md) to configure a policy for Microsoft Teams.

3. Under **Pinned apps**, choose **Add apps**.

4. Select your preferred policy under **Search based on this app permission policy**.

5. Search for **Career Coach** under **Search by name**, and then select **Add** > **Add** to close the pane.

6. Choose the order for the app to appear and select **Confirm**.

Students will be notified in Microsoft Teams that Career Coach has been pinned.
