# Setting voicemail policies in your organization

> [!WARNING]
> For Skype for Business customers, disabling voicemail through a Microsoft Teams calling policy might also disable the voicemail service for your Skype for Business users.

## Voicemail organization defaults for all users
- Voicemail transcription is enabled.
- Voicemail transcription profanity masking is disabled.
- The maximum recording duration is set to five minutes.

You can control these defaults by using the [Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy) and [Grant-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/Get-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy) cmdlets.

Voicemail messages received by users in your organization are transcribed in the region where your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 organization is hosted. The region where your tenant is hosted might not be the same region where the user receiving the voicemail message is located. To view the region where your tenant is hosted, go to the [Organization profile](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2067339) page and then click **View details** next to **Data location**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't create a new policy instance for transcription and transcription profanity masking using the **New-CsOnlineVoiceMailPolicy** cmdlet, and you can't remove an existing policy instance using the **Remove-CsOnlineVoiceMailPolicy** cmdlet.

You can manage the transcription settings for your users using voicemail policies. To see all available voicemail policy instances, you can use the [Get-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/Get-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy) cmdlet.

```PowerShell
PS C:\> Get-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy


Identity                            : Global
EnableTranscription                 : True
ShareData                           : Defer
EnableTranscriptionProfanityMasking : False
EnableEditingCallAnswerRulesSetting : True
MaximumRecordingLength              : 00:05:00
EnableTranscriptionTranslation      : True

Identity                            : Tag:Default
EnableTranscription                 : True
ShareData                           : Defer
EnableTranscriptionProfanityMasking : False
EnableEditingCallAnswerRulesSetting : True
MaximumRecordingLength              : 00:05:00
EnableTranscriptionTranslation      : True

Identity                            : Tag:TranscriptionProfanityMaskingEnabled
EnableTranscription                 : True
ShareData                           : Defer

EnableTranscriptionTranslation      : True

Identity                            : Tag:TranscriptionDisabled
EnableTranscription                 : False
ShareData                           : Defer

```
  
## Turning off transcription for your organization

Because the default setting for transcription is on for your organization, you may want to disable it by using [Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy). To do this, run:

```PowerShell
Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy -EnableTranscription $false
```

## Turning on transcription profanity masking for your organization

Transcription profanity masking is disabled by default for your organization. If there is a business requirement to enable it, you can enable transcription profanity masking by using [Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy). To do this, run:

```PowerShell
Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy -EnableTranscriptionProfanityMasking $true
```

## Changing the recording duration for your organization

The maximum recording length is set to five minutes by default for your organization. If there is a business requirement to increase or decrease the maximum recording length, this can be done by using [Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy). For example, to set the maximum recording time to 60 seconds,  run:

```PowerShell
Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy -MaximumRecordingLength ([TimeSpan]::FromSeconds(60))
```

## Dual language system prompts for your organization

By default, the voicemail system prompts are presented to callers in the language selected by the user when setting up their voicemail. If there is a business requirement to have the voicemail system prompts presented in two languages, this can be done by using [Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy). A primary and secondary language must be set and may not be the same. To do this, run:

```PowerShell
Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy -PrimarySystemPromptLanguage en-US -SecondarySystemPromptLanguage es-ES
```

## Turning off transcription for a user

User policies are evaluated before the organizational default settings. For example, if voicemail transcription is enabled for all of your users, you can assign a policy to disable transcription for a specific user by using the [Grant-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/Grant-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy) cmdlet.

To disable transcription for a single user, run:

```PowerShell
Grant-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy -PolicyName TranscriptionDisabled -Identity sip:amosmar@contoso.com
```

## Turning on transcription profanity masking for a user

To enable transcription profanity masking for a specific user, you can assign a policy to enable transcription profanity masking for a specific user by using the [Grant-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/Grant-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy) cmdlet.

To enable transcription profanity masking for a single user, run:

```PowerShell
Grant-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy -PolicyName TranscriptionProfanityMaskingEnabled -Identity sip:amosmar@contoso.com
```

## Changing the recording duration for a user

You must first create a custom voicemail policy using the [New-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/New-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy) cmdlet. The command shown below creates a per-user online voicemail policy OneMinuteVoicemailPolicy with MaximumRecordingLength set to 60 seconds and other fields set to tenant level global value.

```PowerShell
New-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy -Identity "OneMinuteVoicemailPolicy" -MaximumRecordingLength ([TimeSpan]::FromSeconds(60))
```

To assign this custom policy to a user, run: 

```PowerShell
Grant-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy -PolicyName OneMinuteVoicemailPolicy -Identity sip:amosmar@contoso.com
```

## Dual language system prompts for a user

You must first create a custom voicemail policy using the [New-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/New-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy) cmdlet. The command shown below creates a per-user online voicemail policy enUS-esSP-VoicemailPolicy with the PrimarySystemPromptLanguage set to en-US (English - United States) and the SecondarySystemPromptLanguage set to es-SP (Spanish - Spain).

```PowerShell
New-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy -Identity "enUS-esES-VoicemailPolicy" -PrimarySystemPromptLanguage en-US -SecondarySystemPromptLanguage es-ES
```

To assign this custom policy to a user, run: 

```PowerShell
Grant-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy -PolicyName "enUS-esES-VoicemailPolicy" -Identity sip:amosmar@contoso.com
```

> [!NOTE]
> The Get-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy cmdlet is not currently returning the values for PrimarySystemPromptLanguage and SecondarySystemPromptLanguage. To see these values modify the command as follows:
>
> >```PowerShell
> > (Get-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy -Identity PolicyName).PrimarySystemPromptLanguage or
> > (Get-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy -Identity PolicyName).SecondarySystemPromptLanguage 
>
> Replace **PolicyName** with the name of the policy.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The voicemail service in Microsoft 365 and Office 365 caches voicemail policies and updates the cache every 6 hours. So, policy changes that you make can take up to 6 hours to be applied.
