# Manage the usage of a phone number

You may need to change the usage of a phone number after it was acquired for or ported in to your organization. Phone number usage can be changed using the Teams admin center, whether it's a service or user number.

## How to manage the usage of a phone number

To change the usage of a phone number by using the Teams admin center:

1. Open the Microsoft Teams Admin Center and log in with a Global admin or a Teams administrator account. This is usually the account you used to sign up for Microsoft 365.

2. In the left navigation, select **Voice** \> **Phone numbers**.

3. On the **Phone numbers** page, choose an unassigned number in the list, and then select **Change usage**.

      > [!NOTE]
      > If you do not see a **Change usage** option, double check the following:
      > - Make sure you're selecting an **unassigned** number before trying to change the usage of it, otherwise the option won't be visible. If the number is currently assigned, you need to [remove the phone number from a user](/MicrosoftTeams/assign-change-or-remove-a-phone-number-for-a-user#remove-a-phone-number-from-a-user) or resource account first.
      > - You must have more than one type of usage in the **Available usages** column. Otherwise, you will not be able to change the number type through the Teams Admin Center.

4. In the **Change usage** pane, open the list of Available usages for the phone number, and select on the intended option to select it.

      > [!NOTE]
      > The list will only display usages that are  available for the telephone number, depending on its number type (geographic, non-geographic, or toll-free) and supplier. You can quickly review the available usages for each phone number by setting the **Available usages** column in the Phone numbers table to visible.

5. Click **Apply** to set the Licensed usage.
