# Manage the usage of a phone number

You might want to change the usage of a phone number after it was acquired or ported into your organization. You can change the usage of user and service numbers by using the Teams admin center.

## How to manage the usage of a phone number

To change the usage of a phone number by using the Teams admin center:

1. Open the Microsoft Teams admin center and log in with a Global admin or a Teams administrator account. This account is usually the one you used to sign up for Microsoft 365.

2. In the left navigation, select **Voice** \> **Phone numbers**.

3. On the **Phone numbers** page, choose an unassigned number in the list, and then select **Change usage**.

   If you don't see a **Change usage** option, check the following:

   - Make sure you're selecting an **unassigned** number before trying to change its usage; otherwise, the option isn't visible. If the number is currently assigned, you need to [remove the phone number from a user](/MicrosoftTeams/assign-change-or-remove-a-phone-number-for-a-user#remove-a-phone-number-from-a-user) or resource account first.
   - You must have more than one type of usage in the **Available usages** column. Otherwise, you can't change the number type through the Teams admin center.

4. In the **Change usage** pane, open the list of available usages for the phone number, and then select the intended option.

   The list only displays usages that are available for the telephone number, depending on its number type (geographic, non-geographic, or toll-free) and supplier. You can quickly review the available usages for each phone number by setting the **Available usages** column in the Phone numbers table to visible.

5. Select **Apply** to set the Licensed usage.
