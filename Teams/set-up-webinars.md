# Admin- Set up webinars in Microsoft Teams

**APPLIES TO:** ✖️Meetings ✔️Webinars ✖️Town halls

[!INCLUDE[Teams Premium](includes/teams-premium-ecm.md)]

Microsoft Teams offers webinars, a two-way interactive virtual event. As an admin, you can set up and manage who can schedule webinars in your organization.

For more information on how to plan for webinars in your org, see [Plan for Teams webinars](plan-webinars.md).

To learn more about the webinar experience for your users, see [Get Started with Teams webinars](https://support.microsoft.com/office/42f3f874-22dc-4289-b53f-bbc1a69013e3).

> [!NOTE]
> The webinar experience isn't available for Microsoft 365 GCC High or Microsoft 365 DoD.

## Manage webinars using the Teams admin center

You can use the Teams admin center to set up and manage the webinar experience for your organization.

### Turn webinars on or off

Follow these steps in the Teams admin center to turn webinars on or off:

1. Open the Teams admin center.
2. Select **Meetings** from the navigation pane.
3. Under **Meetings**, select **Events Policies**.
4. Either select an existing policy or create a new one.
5. Toggle the **Allow webinars** setting **On** or **Off**.
6. Select **Save**.

## Manage webinars using PowerShell

You can use PowerShell to set up and manage the webinar experience for your organization.

To set up webinars, use the **`-AllowWebinars`** parameter within the PowerShell [**CsTeamsEventsPolicy**](/powershell/module/teams/set-csteamseventspolicy) cmdlet.

The following table shows the behaviors of the settings for the **`-AllowWebinars`** parameter:

|Setting value| Behavior|
|---------|---------------|
|Enabled| Users with this policy can create webinars. |
|Disabled| Users with this policy can't create webinars.|

Before you can run these cmdlets, you must be connected to Microsoft Teams PowerShell. For more information, see [Manage Teams with Microsoft Teams PowerShell](/microsoftteams/teams-powershell-managing-teams).

For more information on PowerShell cmdlets for Teams webinars, see [Related articles](#related-articles).

```powershell
Set-CsTeamsEventsPolicy -Identity <policy name> -AllowWebinars Enabled
```

### Turn off webinars

## Manage whether organizers can schedule public or private webinars

You can use PowerShell to manage whether organizers can [create public or private webinars](https://support.microsoft.com/office/0719a9bd-07a0-47fd-8415-6c576860f36a):
