# Manage your devices in Microsoft Teams

 As an admin, you manage all devices used with Teams in your organization from the Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business admin center. You can view and manage the device inventory for your organization and do tasks such as update, restart, and monitor diagnostics for devices. You can also create and assign configuration profiles to a device or groups of devices. 

## What devices can you manage?
Devices must be certified for Teams and enrolled in Teams. A device is automatically enrolled the first time a user signs in to Teams on the device. For a list of certified devices that can be managed, see [Conference phones](https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/across-devices/devices/category?categoryid=ddb1bc66-7499-4823-8d2b-a2c6dbe4f716) and [Desk phones](https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/across-devices/devices/category?categoryid=c6536b33-f554-4b55-bd3d-c98733ebc017&page=1&filters=).

> [!NOTE]
> If you have Microsoft Intune, devices are automatically enrolled in Intune. After a device is enrolled, device compliance is confirmed and conditional access policies are applied to the device.
