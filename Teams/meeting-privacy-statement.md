# Customize and display your privacy statement in the meeting join experience

**APPLIES TO:** ✔️Meetings ✖️Webinars ✖️Town halls

Microsoft Teams enables businesses to schedule and conduct business-to-customer engagements with customers, clients, and other people outside your organization, as well as with employees within your organization. Organizations have a need to make their privacy statement available to attendees when they join a meeting, especially in engagements with external participants.

You can customize and display a link to your organization's privacy statement in the Teams meeting join experience to ensure attendees are aware of your organization's privacy guidelines before they join a meeting.

## Set your organization's privacy statement

Tenant admins can configure your organization's privacy statement in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Settings** > **Org Settings**, and then select the **Security & privacy** tab.
1. Choose **Privacy profile**.

1. Enter the URL of your organization's privacy statement and the email address of your privacy contact, and then select **Save**.

## Meeting join experience

After it's set up, the privacy statement link is shown to attendees in the lower-left corner of the meeting join experience. When external and internal attendees join using the Teams meeting link in their meeting invitation or from their Teams or Outlook calendar, they can go the privacy statement link to view your organization's privacy statement.
