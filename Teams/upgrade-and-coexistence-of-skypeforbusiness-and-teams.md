This article is part of Deployment and Implementation stage of your upgrade journey. Before proceeding, confirm that you’ve completed the following activities:

-   [Enlisted your project stakeholders](upgrade-enlist-stakeholders.md)
-   [Defined your project scope](https://aka.ms/SkypetoTeams-Scope)
-   [Understood coexistence and interoperability of Skype for Business and Teams](https://aka.ms/SkypeToTeams-Coexist)

# Choose your upgrade journey from Skype for Business to Teams

As an existing Skype for Business customer, your complete transition to Teams might take some time. However, you can begin realizing the value of Teams today, by enabling your users to use Teams alongside Skype for Business. Given that there’s some overlapping functionality between the two apps, we recommend that you review the available coexistence and upgrade modes to help determine which path is right for your organization. For example, you might opt to enable all workloads on both solutions without interoperability. Or, you might decide to manage the user experience, either by gradually introducing Teams capabilities or by targeting groups of users for select capabilities, until your organization is ready to upgrade everyone to Teams. Use the outcome of your pilot to help assess the right upgrade journey for your organization.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article outlines the various modes that enable you to manage which modalities in Skype for Business and Teams are available to your users. As with any deployment, we strongly encourage you to [pilot your intended plan](pilot-essentials.md) with a selected group of users before upgrading your organization to Teams. Remember, introducing new technology can be disruptive for users. Take time to assess user readiness and implement a communication and training plan prior to implementing any of the modes outlined herein.
 
## Upgrade journey building blocks
To formally prepare your organization for its journey to Teams, you need to start planning for the upgrade scenarios that will eventually let your organization fully embrace Teams as your sole communications and collaboration solution.

To help guide your decision-making process, familiarize yourself with the various modes, concepts, and terminology relevant to upgrading from Skype for Business to Teams. For more information, see [Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business coexistence and interoperability](https://aka.ms/SkypeToTeams-Coexist)

When some of your users are ready to use only Teams for their day-to-day communications and collaboration needs, you can start upgrading these users to Teams by enabling **Teams only** mode for them.

If it’s not feasible for your whole organization to move to Teams, you can start by piloting Teams alongside Skype for Business in **Islands** coexistence mode. When the additional coexistence modes, such as **Skype for Business with Teams collaboration** and **Skype for Business with Teams collaboration and meetings**, are available, you can also start by fully adopting Teams as a group collaboration solution first while keeping Skype for Business as your organization’s unified communications solution. Another option is to start moving meetings to Teams in addition to introducing Teams group collaboration capabilities, while keeping the rest of the unified communications capabilities in Skype for Business.

The following table compares coexistence and upgrade modes.

|Mode  |Situation  |Short-term goals  |Advantages  |Caveats  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Islands |Smaller or simpler Skype for Business deployment<br><br>Ability and willingness to manage some short-term complexity to move to Teams more quickly |Go to the full Teams experience as quickly as possible<br><br>Conduct a proof of concept (PoC) of Teams |Simple to operate, no interoperability<br><br>Best Teams experience up-front for all capabilities |Requires good user communication to avoid confusion and to drive usage toward Teams<br><br>Exit strategy requires users to have fully adopted Teams by the time Skype for Business is decommissioned|
|Skype for Business with Teams collaboration only |Skype for Business deployment with requirements that aren’t yet met by Teams (for example, advanced compliance)<br><br>Long-term need for and/or commitment to Skype for Business|Start Teams adoption quickly, focusing on group collaboration first<br><br> Want to keep all unified communications workloads on Skype for Business for now|No overlapping capabilities between Teams and Skype for Business<br><br>Instant messaging and chat will reside in Skype for Business (tied to calling)<br><br>|
|Skype for Business with Teams collaboration and meetings |Skype for Business deployment with significant use of enterprise voice and requirements that aren’t yet met by Teams calling<br><br>Long-term need for and/or commitment to Skype for Business<br><br>Might be using a third-party meeting service|Start Teams adoption quickly, going beyond group collaboration<br><br>Improve your users’ meetings experience|No overlapping capabilities<br><br>High-value meetings on Teams (WebRTC, cloud meeting recordings, and so on)|Instant messaging and chat will reside in Skype for Business (tied to calling)|

## Upgrade journeys
You can take multiple approaches to upgrading from Skype for Business, either online or on-premises, to Teams:
- In a direct upgrade journey, you first deploy Teams alongside Skype for Business in **Islands** mode as part of evaluation and early adoption, and then upgrade your users to **Teams only** mode with the goal of quickly retiring Skype for Business from the environment for all users in the organization.
- A gradual upgrade journey delivers a specific coexistence and upgrade mode to a specific group of users (also called a *cohort*), depending on their communications and collaboration requirements. Over time, the entire organization can converge into using Teams only and eventually replace Skype for Business. However, if your organization has compelling business reasons to keep Skype for Business—such as a dependency on a Unified Communications Managed API (UCMA)–based solution that integrates with line-of-business applications, or an ethical wall solution currently available for Skype for Business only—you can upgrade a majority of users to **Teams only** mode while retaining Skype for Business users in one of the coexistence modes for a portion of your user population.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For both types of upgrade journey, if your organization is currently a Skype for Business on-premises deployment only, you need to start planning to implement Skype for Business hybrid before upgrading your users to **Teams only** mode. This will also help facilitate interoperability with Teams.
> Use [MyAdvisor](https://myadvisor.fasttrack.microsoft.com/) to guide your Skype for Business hybrid implementation.

> [!NOTE]
> **Teams only** mode requires that the users who are part of cohorts be homed in Skype for Business Online, and a hybrid relationship between your Skype for Business on-premises deployment and your Skype for Business Online tenant is required to facilitate the interoperability between Skype for Business and Teams. The move to Skype for Business Online must be completed for users who are part of the cohorts before they’re upgraded to **Teams only** mode. Skype for Business Server 2019, and also a future cumulative update for Skype for Business Server 2015, plan to simplify the mechanics of upgrading on-premises users to Teams by managing the migration to Skype for Business Online and upgrading the users to **Teams only** mode in one step.

### Direct upgrade journey
The direct upgrade journey is illustrated in the following diagram.

![A screenshot of the direct upgrade journey. All users initially use Teams in Islands mode, then transition to Teams-only mode, with the end state of the entire organization upgraded to Teams.](media/upgrade_journey_direct_upgrade.png)

Teams is deployed to all users in the organization and configured in **Islands** mode. When your organization determines that Teams is ready to fulfill all of your communications and collaboration needs, all users are upgraded to **Teams only** mode. At that point, Skype for Business can be retired from the environment.

### Gradual upgrade journey
An example of a gradual upgrade journey is illustrated in the following diagram.

![In the gradual upgrade journey, cohorts of users initially use Teams in Islands mode for evaluation and then in a variety of upgrade modes for early adoption, side by side with Skype for Business. Some cohorts transition to Teams-only mode, while one group of users stays with Skype for Business with Teams collaboration and meetings mode.](media/upgrade_journey_gradual_upgrade.png)

Teams is deployed in the organization in **Islands** mode for evalution and then move to different coexistence and upgrade modes for different groups of users. For example, a group of users can be enabled for **Islands** mode, another enabled for **Skype for Business with Teams collaboration and meetings** mode, while a third group of users might initially be enabled for **Skype for Business with Teams collaboration only** mode.

Over time, groups of users can be upgraded to **Teams only** mode, followed by the rest of the organization. Eventually, the entire organization will be ready to retire Skype for Business and use only Teams for communications and collaboration, or—if business requirements dictate that Skype for Business be retained for a specific group—the majority of users in the organization can use Teams only. <br><br>
