# Add, change, or remove an emergency location for your organization

An emergency location must be associated with a phone number, but when this happens can vary between countries and regions. For example, in the United States, you need to associate an emergency location when you assign the phone number to the user. In the United Kingdom, you need to associate an emergency location to the phone number when you get the phone numbers from Office 365 or transfer phone numbers from your current service provider.

No matter which country or region you are in, you can add a place or places to an emergency location and remove an emergency location. Depending on the number of physical locations in your organization, you can create places for buildings, floors, and offices. See [What are emergency locations, addresses and call routing?](/microsoftteams/what-are-emergency-locations-addresses-and-call-routing).
  
To learn how to get a Calling Plan and how much they cost, see [Teams add-on licensing](teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md).
