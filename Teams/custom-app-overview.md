# Understand and manage custom and sideloaded apps

Microsoft Teams allows developers within your organization to build, test, and deploy custom apps for organization's internal users. Such apps are called custom apps or Line of Business apps. Your organization may commission the creation of custom apps for org-specific requirements.

You as an admin have the control to allow or block such apps for entire organization or for specific users. Developers in your organization can build custom low-code solutions by using Teams integration with [Microsoft Power Platform](/microsoftteams/platform/samples/teams-low-code-solutions).

Developers can submit their custom apps via Teams for approval from admin. You can use app setup policies to control the rollout, distribution, and permissions of custom apps.

After you allow the use of a custom app, your end-users can find it by selecting **Built for your org** in the left navigation of Teams store.

## Understand sideloading of custom apps

When developing custom apps and before distributing those apps to the end-users, developers test the apps by adding it to Teams Store to test. The developers can test on their own or with a specified group of users, but the app is not available to other end-users in the organization via the store. This method is called sideloading of apps and applies only to custom apps.

Developers can sideload an app to make it available to the members of a specific team, typically to test an under-development app. Using an app in this way limits its usage to the app developers and doesn't require admin approval as long as admin allows sideloading in Teams.

Developers can share a sideloaded app with a specific team without submitting it to the Teams app catalog. It makes the sideloaded custom app available to a limited group of end-users but not available in your organization's app store for all end-users.

As an admin, you can disallow sideloading of app for all developers. If you disallow sideloading, the developers can still test their apps by [creating a separate test tenant](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant). Once custom app development is complete, developers request administrators to distribute their custom app to the end-users. For details, see [how to publish a custom app](/microsoftteams/upload-custom-apps). As an admin, you can allow or disallow the use a custom app for specific users.

## Allow developers to upload custom apps

You can create a custom policy or edit the global policy to allow or block custom apps based on the needs of your organization. To create a custom policy that lets organization's developers to upload custom apps, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to Teams admin center and access **Teams apps** > **[Setup policies](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/app-setup)**.

1. Select **Add**.

1. Provide a name and description for the policy.

1. Turn on or turn off **Upload custom apps**.

> [!NOTE]
> To change this setting, allow third-party apps in your tenant's [org-wide app settings](manage-apps.md#manage-org-wide-app-settings).
