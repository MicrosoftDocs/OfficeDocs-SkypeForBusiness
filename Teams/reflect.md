# IT Admin Guide to Reflect in Microsoft Teams

This document provides information concerning [Reflect](https://aka.ms/reflect) â€“ an integral part of [Education Insights in Microsoft Teams](class-insights.md). Reflect helps students recognize and navigate their emotions by providing regular opportunities to share and be heard. Reflect can help broaden learners' emotional vocabulary and deepen empathy for their peers while also providing valuable feedback to educators for a healthy classroom community.

This check-in app uses emojis and research-backed emotional granularity to support educators in adding social and emotional learning into their already busy routine.


## Privacy and Security
Reflect follows the same privacy and security standards as [Education Insights](class-insights.md) to protect students' sensitive information.

Reflect, as part of Microsoft 365, meets national, regional, and industry-specific regulations for data collection and use, including [GDPR](/compliance/regulatory/gdpr) and the [Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)](/compliance/regulatory/offering-ferpa) that protects the privacy of students' education records.

The data belongs to the institution, and Microsoft only collects the data and stores it. Microsoft personnel cannot access the data or see it, except as allowed by compliance in an audited way to maintain the service, such as data recovery.

Students *never* see the names of other students, only how they responded. While they can see the distribution of responses, they *cannot* see names associated with each reflection. 

> [!NOTE]
> If less than five students respond, no data is shown to the students. This is to minimize the possibility of students identifying each other's responses.

> [!TIP]
> * Visit the [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center) to learn more about how Microsoft protects your data.
> * Visit [Microsoft compliance offerings](/compliance/regulatory/offering-home) to learn how Microsoft 365 helps your institution meet regulatory compliance standards.

## Data collection and storage
The data belongs to the educational institution, and Microsoft only collects the data and stores it. Microsoft personnel cannot access the data or see it, except as allowed by compliance in an audited way to maintain the service, such as data recovery.

The data is stored in Education Insights. By default, Education Insights is turned on. When you opt-out, we **delete all the data collected for Reflect**. Turn Education Insights back on, and we start collecting data from the time it's re-enabled.

In the [IT Admin Guide to Education Insights](class-insights.md), you can read how Education Insights works (including storage locations) and [how to turn Education Insights off or on](class-insights.md#turn-insights-on-or-off) when you want to delete the data or enable the service.

Data is collected from student in Reflect, though guest data is not collected. **If a student is defined as a guest, their data is not collected.** 

## Enable Reflect
If you manage the app setup policy for your institution, ensure that Reflect is *allowed* in your tenant. You can also add Reflect to the relevant class teams from the Teams admin center.

To enable a user to install and interact with any app, you must allow the app at the org level on the **Manage apps** page and the **app permission policy** assigned to the user.

If you have previously defined that each app needs to be allowed, please go to the Manage apps page and 'allow' Reflect. **When you block an app, the app doesn't appear in Teams for any users in your organization.**

> [!NOTE]
> To have access to the Reflect app, you will need an A1, A3, or A5 license for Microsoft 365.

> [!TIP]
> For more details, read [how to allow an app or to add it to a class team](manage-apps.md#allow-and-block-apps).

## Where do educators find Reflect?
Once you have enabled Reflect, educators go to the class and select **New Conversation**. They then select '**...**' to bring up messaging extensions and enter **Reflect** in the search bar. The dialog box guides them through defining the question and who can see what.
