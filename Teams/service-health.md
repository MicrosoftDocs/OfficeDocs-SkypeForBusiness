# Verify service health for Microsoft Teams

Service health for Microsoft Teams is displayed on the Microsoft 365 admin center. Before troubleshooting issues, it's a good practice to verify that the Teams service is healthy. Go to the <a href=" https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal/home?ref=servicehealth" target="_blank">Teams Service Health</a> console to review the service health.

Also, keep in mind that, Microsoft Teams is built on top of other Microsoft 365 or Office 365 services, so when you look at Service Health, remember to also check the status of Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive for Business. Service Health issues for these other services doesn't automatically mean Teams is affected (for example, Address Book downloads in Exchange are unavailable), but you should review the advisories for those affected services to determine if there's an impact to Microsoft Teams.
