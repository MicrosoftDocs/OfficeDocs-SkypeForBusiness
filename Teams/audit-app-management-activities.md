# Search audit logs for app management activities and events

Microsoft Purview Audit (Standard) in Microsoft 365 lets you search for audit records of activities performed in the various Microsoft 365 services by end-users and administrators.

Before you can search the audit records, ensure that you complete the following prerequisites:

* [Obtain organization's subscription and user licensing](/microsoft-365/compliance/set-up-basic-audit).
* [Turn on auditing in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal](/microsoft-365/compliance/turn-audit-log-search-on-or-off).
* [Assign permissions to search the audit log](/microsoft-365/compliance/set-up-basic-audit).

## Search the audit logs for app events in Teams

The audit logs for app events in Teams help you investigate specific actions related to app management by admins. While you can search the logs for a wide-range of actions, the following table lists some such actions that are logged.

| Teams app action | Activity name in the Portal | Description  |
|-------|-------|:-------|
| **Installed app**                 | `AppInstalled`               | An app is installed or added to a Teams client. |
| **Upgraded app**                  | `AppUpgraded`                | An app is upgraded to its latest version in the catalog. |
| **Uninstalled app**               | `AppUninstalled`             | An app is uninstalled or removed from a Teams client.                                   |
| **Published app**                 | `AppPublishedToCatalog`      | An app is added to the catalog.                          |
| **Updated app**                   | `AppUpdatedInCatalog`        | An app is updated in the catalog.                        |
| **Deleted app**                   | `AppDeletedFromCatalog`      | An app is deleted from the catalog.                      |
| **Deleted all organization apps** | `DeletedAllOrganizationApps` | Deleted all organization apps from the catalog.          |

You can export the searched audit records as a CSV file. For more information, see [Export, configure, and view audit logs](/microsoft-365/compliance/export-view-audit-log-records).

> [!NOTE]
> When one of the above activities is performed by a user or admin, Teams generates and stores an audit record. In Audit (Standard), records are retained for 90 days, which means you can search for activities that occurred within the past three months.

> [!TIP]
> As an admin, if you want to create a per-user report to know if a user has blocked or muted a bot, see [Understand who blocked, muted or uninstalled a bot](/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/conversations/send-proactive-messages?#understand-who-blocked-muted-or-uninstalled-a-bot).
