# New Teams for Web - Overview and prerequisites

>[!Note]
> The features described in this article are available to [**Teams Public preview**](/microsoftteams/public-preview-doc-updates) and [**Microsoft 365 Targeted release**](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/release-options-in-office-365?view=o365-worldwide#targeted-release) customers only. Features and content are subject to change. Check back for updates.


The new Teams for Web is reimagined from the ground up with performance in mind, providing a faster, simpler, and more flexible experience. The new Teams client installs and loads faster, letting you launch the app and join meetings more quickly, giving you more time to focus on the business tasks.

## How to try new Teams: App Switcher 

1. Navigate to the Teams web client at https://teams.microsoft.com using Microsoft Edge or Chrome browsers.
2. Select the **Try the new Teams** toggle on the upper-left corner of the app to switch to new Teams.

>[!Note] 
>This experience is currently optimized for non-EDU users. If you're an EDU user, you'll see the App switcher and are welcome to try it out, but we don't recommend you use it for primary scenarios yet.


## Prerequisites

### Minimum Browser versions

New Teams for Web follows the same [browser requirements](/microsoftteams/get-clients?tabs=Windows#browser-client) and [hardware requirements](/microsoftteams/hardware-requirements-for-the-teams-app) as classic Teams for Microsoft Edge and Chrome Browsers:

- The browser must be configured to allow third-party cookies
- The browser runs on a desktop computer
- The browser is updated to one of the three most-recent versions of Microsoft Edge or Chrome


## Features currently not available

The new Teams web client supports the same features as the classic Teams web client except:

- Tenant switching (coming soon)
- The new Teams web client offers near feature parity with the new Desktop client thanks to a new, cross-client infrastructure. 

The following notable features aren't available on new Teams or classic Teams clients:

- Simultaneous availability and notifications across multiple accounts and tenants
- Popout windows for chat and channel content
- Avatars and video background effects, except for background blur

## Enhancements in new Teams

The following issues from classic Teams Web are now fixed in new Teams Web:

- Support for more than two concurrent Teams tabs
- Screen reader challenges with notifications
- Various stability and performance issues
