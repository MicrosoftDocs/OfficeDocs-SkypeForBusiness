# New Teams for Web - Overview and prerequisites

The new Teams for Web is reimagined from the ground up with performance in mind, providing a faster, simpler, and more flexible experience. The new Teams client installs and loads faster, letting you launch the app and join meetings more quickly, giving you more time to focus on the business tasks.

## New Teams for Web rollout schedule

New Teams on the Teams for Web client is available on Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari browsers.

Teams for Web users that havenâ€™t updated to new Teams experience will be automatically updated following the same timelines as native clients listed in [End of availability for classic Teams client](teams-classic-client-end-of-availability.md).

>[!Note]
>Education, Special Cloud, GCC, GCC-High, and DOD customer segments operate on separate timelines than what is presented here.

## Prerequisites

New Teams for Web is supported on the following browsers when running on a desktop computer:

|Browser        |Supported versions    |Operating System      |
|:--------------|:---------------------|:---------------------|
|Microsoft Edge |Latest three versions |Windows, macOS, Linux |
|Chrome         |Latest three versions |Windows, macOS, Linux |
|Firefox        |Latest three versions |Windows, macOS, Linux |
|Safari         |Latest two versions   |macOS                 |

The browser must be configured to allow third-party cookies for some third-party or line-of-business (LOB) apps to function properly.

>[!Note]
>New Teams for Web isn't supported in VDI environments, so performance and reliability may be negatively impacted if used in VDI. New Teams for Web isn't supported on mobile browsers.

## Features not currently available

New Teams for Web offers near feature parity with the new Desktop client thanks to a new, cross-client infrastructure.

The following notable features aren't available on new Teams or classic Teams for Web:

- Simultaneous availability and notifications across multiple accounts and tenants.
- Popout windows for chat and channel content.
- Avatars and video background effects, except for background blur.

New Teams for Web supports the same features available on classic Teams for Web with the exception of the changes listed in [Features that are changing in the new Microsoft Teams](new-teams-whats-changing.md).

## Enhancements in new Teams

The following issues from classic Teams Web are now fixed in new Teams Web:

- Support for more than two concurrent Teams tabs.
- Screen reader challenges with notifications.
- Various stability and performance issues.
