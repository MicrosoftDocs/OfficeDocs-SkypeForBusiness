# Manage resource accounts for service numbers

[!INCLUDE [set-up-resource-account-steps](./includes/set-up-resource-account-steps.md)]

## Next steps

Once you've completed the resource account setup and assigning a phone number if needed, you're ready to use the resource account with an Auto attendant or Call queue.

See the following references to learn more:

- [Cloud Auto attendant](create-a-phone-system-auto-attendant.md)
- [Cloud Call queue](create-a-phone-system-call-queue.md)

You can edit the resource account **Display name** and **Resource account** type using the **Edit** option. Select **Save** when you're done.

## Change an existing resource account to use a Microsoft Teams Phone Resource Account license

To switch the licenses on your existing resource account from a **Teams Phone Standard** license to a **Microsoft Teams Phone Resource Account** license, you'll need to acquire the **Microsoft Teams Phone Resource Account** license, and then follow the steps in the Microsoft 365 admin center to [Move users to a different subscription](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users#move-users-to-a-different-subscription).

> [!WARNING]
> Always remove a **Teams Phone Standard** license and assign the **Microsoft Teams Phone Resource Account** license in the same license activity. If you remove the old license, save the account changes, add the new license, and then save the account settings again, the resource account may no longer function as expected. If this happens, we recommend you create a new resource account for the **Microsoft Teams Phone Resource Account** license and remove the broken resource account.

## Skype For Business Server 2019

For resource accounts homed on Skype For Business Server 2019 that can be used with cloud Call queues and cloud Auto attendants, see [Plan Cloud Call queues](/SkypeforBusiness/hybrid/plan-call-queue) or [Plan Cloud Auto attendants](/SkypeForBusiness/hybrid/plan-cloud-auto-attendant). Hybrid implementations (numbers homed on Direct Routing) are configured using the [New-CsHybridApplicationEndpoint](/powershell/module/skype/new-cshybridapplicationendpoint) cmdlet on an on-premises Skype for Business Server 2019 server.

The application IDs that you need to use while creating the application instances are:

- **Auto Attendant:** ce933385-9390-45d1-9512-c8d228074e07
- **Call Queue:** 11cd3e2e-fccb-42ad-ad00-878b93575e07

> [!NOTE]
> If you want the Call queue or Auto attendant to be searchable by Skype For Business Server 2019 users, you should create your resource accounts on Skype For Business Server 2019, since online resource accounts are not synced down to Active Directory. When DNS SRV records for `sipfederationtls` resolve to Skype for Business Server 2019, then resource accounts **must** be created on Skype For Business Server 2019 using SfB Management shell and synchronized to Azure AD.

For hybrid implementations with Skype for Business Server:

- [Plan Cloud Auto attendants](/SkypeForBusiness/hybrid/plan-cloud-auto-attendant).
- [Plan Cloud Call queues](/SkypeforBusiness/hybrid/plan-call-queue).
- [Configure on-premises resource accounts](/SkypeForBusiness/hybrid/configure-onprem-ra).

## Delete a resource account

Make sure you dissociate the telephone number from the resource account before deleting it, to avoid getting your phone number stuck in pending mode.

1. Sign into the [Teams admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2066851).
2. Expand **Voice**, and then select **Resource accounts** page.
3. Select the resource account to which you want to assign a phone number, and then select **Assign/unassign**.
4. Select the **X** on the assigned Auto attendant or Call queue.
5. Select the **Save** button.

After you do that, you can delete the resource account in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339), under the [**Users**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834822) tab.

## Hide resource accounts from Teams users

You may want to hide certain resources accounts from Teams users. For example, you may want to prevent Teams users from directly calling a Call queue and bypassing the Auto attendant where the hours of operation are configured.

[Information barriers](information-barriers-in-teams.md) are used to hide the resource accounts.  Review the information barriers documentation to understand the possible impacts before proceeding with the steps below.

### Required subscriptions and permissions

To access and use information barriers, your organization must have one of the following subscriptions or add ons:

- Microsoft 365 E5/A5 subscription (paid or trial version).
- Office 365 E5/A5/A3/A1 subscription (paid or trial version).
- Office 365 Advanced Compliance add-on.
- Microsoft 365 E3/A3/A1 subscription + the Microsoft 365 E5/A5 Compliance add-on.
- Microsoft 365 E3/A3/A1 subscription + the Microsoft 365 E5/A5 Insider Risk Management add-on.

> [!NOTE]
> If you already have [Exchange Online](/exchange/address-books/address-book-policies/address-book-policies) address book policies configured, they must be removed before proceeding with the steps below.
>
> All the steps below are performed by the Tenant Global Administrator.
>
> These instructions assume there are no other information barriers configured.

#### Teams admin center

1. Sign into the [Teams admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2066851).
2. In the left-rail menu, expand **Teams**.
3. Select **Teams settings**.
4. Scroll down to **Search by name**.
5. Turn on the toggle, and save the change.

For more information on this option, see [Limit who users can see when searching the directory in Teams](teams-scoped-directory-search.md).

4. Select the **Start recording user and admin activity**.

For more information on auditing, see [Set up Audit (Standard) in Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/compliance/audit-standard-setup).

#### Segmenting Data

The Resource Accounts that shouldn't be called directly need to be segmented and easily identifiable.  This can be done by making them members of a particular group or by some unique information in their user profile such as:

- Company
- User principal name
- Location
- Department
- Usage location
- Mail nickname (Alias)
- Physical delivery office name (Office)
- Postal code
- Proxy address (Email Address)
- Street address
- Target address (ExternalEmailAddress)
- Mail (WindowsEmailAddress)
- Description

In the example steps below, the `Department` field will be used.
