| 1  | Validate that your environment includes all Teams prerequisites | Teams depends on other platforms to construct an end-to-end collaboration solution. Work with your IT teams to ensure that you’ve deployed and properly configured Exchange, SharePoint Online, and OneDrive for Business. | | [How SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business interact with Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/sharepoint-onedrive-interact) <br/><br/>[How Exchange and Microsoft Teams interact](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/exchange-teams-interact) |
| 2  | Validate that Teams is enabled for the tenant | Teams is turned on by default for all organizations. Check the **Services & add-ins** page in the Office 365 admin center to verify that Teams is enabled for your tenant, and enable it if necessary. | | [Set up Microsoft Teams in your Office 365 organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/office-365-set-up) |
| 3  | Configure roles and permissions | Teams support two types of roles: Member and Owner. <br/><br/>After adding a member to a team, an owner can also promote a member to the Owner role. As a best practice, we recommend that you have at least two owners assigned to each team. <br/><br/>By default, everyone in the organization who has a mailbox hosted on Exchange Online can create a team. A user who creates a new team is automatically granted the Owner role for that team. <br/><br/>If you need to, you can configure Office 365 group settings to only let specific users create new teams. | | [Assign roles and permissions in Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/assign-roles-permissions) <br/><br/>[Office 365 groups and Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/office-365-groups) <br/><br/>[Manage who can create Office 365 Groups](https://support.office.com/article/Manage-who-can-create-Office-365-Groups-4c46c8cb-17d0-44b5-9776-005fced8e618) |
| 4  | Configure tenant-wide Teams settings | You can configure some Teams settings at the tenant level. Users who are enabled for Teams inherit these settings from the tenant configuration:<ul><li>General</li><li>Email integration</li><li>Apps</li><li>Custom cloud storage</li><li>Calls and meetings</li><li>Messaging</li></ul>| | [Enable Microsoft Teams features in your Office 365 organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/enable-features-office-365) |
| 5  | OPTIONAL: Configure guest access | You use guest access in Teams to collaborate with people outside your organization by granting them access to teams and channels. Guest access is a tenant-level setting in Teams. It’s turned off by default. <br/>Enable guest access and configure tenant-wide guest settings, if your organization plans to use that feature. | | [Guest access in Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/guest-access) |
| 6  | OPTIONAL: Configure Teams naming policy | Teams leverages the naming policies for Office 365 Groups when users create or edit team names. <br/><br/>By default, no naming restrictions are applied when a user creates a team. <br/><br/>If you need to enforce rules for teams names, configure Office 365 Groups naming policies that apply to your organization. You can set mandatory prefixes and suffixes and specify blocked words. | | [Plan for Office 365 groups when creating teams in Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/plan-office-365-groups) <br/><br/>[Office 365 Groups naming policy](https://support.office.com/article/Office-365-Groups-naming-policy-6ceca4d3-cad1-4532-9f0f-d469dfbbb552) |
| 7  | Configure Exchange for the Teams SMTP domain | Teams uses Exchange Online to send notifications to team members by using the SMTP domain — email.teams.microsoft.com — when they’ve been added or removed. <br/><br/>Be sure to add this SMTP domain to the accepted domains list in your Exchange infrastructure. | | [Add the Microsoft Teams SMTP domain as an accepted domain in Exchange Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/smtp-accepted-domain) |
| 8  | Configure and manage user access to Teams | Although we highly recommend that you enable all users for Teams, you can allow or disallow access to Teams on a per-user basis by assigning or removing the Teams product license. | | [Manage user access to Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/user-access) |
| 9  | Assign licenses to users | Assign licenses to your users for features like Audio Conferencing, Phone System, and Calling Plans | | [Assign Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams licenses](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/assign-skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-licenses) <br/><br/>[MyAdvisor – User enablement scripts](https://myadvisor.fasttrack.microsoft.com/CloudVoice/Downloads?SelectedIDs=5_2_0_6,5_2_0_3) |
| 10 | Optional: Use PowerShell to administer Teams | You can use PowerShell cmdlets rather than the Office 365 admin center to administer and manage Teams settings. | | [Microsoft Teams PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/teams/?view=teams-ps) |
