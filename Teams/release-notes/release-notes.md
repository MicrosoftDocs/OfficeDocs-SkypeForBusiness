Cortana voice skills in Teams mobile app help users perform meeting, communication, and collaboration tasks simply using spoken natural language. Users can speak to Cortana by clicking on the microphone button in Teams app and make requests like “Call Megan” or “Send a message to my next meeting” if they need to connect with someone while juggling household chores or walking the dog or generally on the go. Users can join meetings simply by saying “Join my next meeting” or check their calendar by asking “what do I have this morning”. Once in a meeting or a call, they can invoke Cortana from the overflow menu in the meeting stage and perform typical in-meeting tasks like adding people by name or number (“Add Megan to the call”), deck presentation (“present the quarterly review deck”) or navigating slides (“Go to the appendix slide”). Other things that the feature supports are finding and sharing files, search, and navigating within the Teams app (“Open my chat with John, Go to my unread activity, Go to my mentions etc.).
