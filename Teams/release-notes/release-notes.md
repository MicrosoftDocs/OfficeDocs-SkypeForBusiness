# Release notes for Microsoft Teams admin features

These release notes provide information about new admin features for Microsoft Teams.

### Easily access meeting options from within a Teams meeting in progress

We're making it easier for meeting organizers to quickly and easily change their presenter and lobby settings once a Teams meeting starts by providing an easy to access link directly in the participants pane. This new functionality will be present for both scheduled and “Meet now” meetings.

### Download a participant report in a Teams meeting

Meeting organizers, especially teachers, often need to know who joined their Teams meetings. Soon you will be able to download a participant report, found in the roster view that includes join and leave times for participants. Available in the roster view, meeting organizers can download the report that includes those users who joined while the organizer was present. This feature is only available within the meeting while the meeting is active. Available on desktop (Windows and Mac) and the web.

### Include system audio in live events

Presenters and producers in live events can now include system audio when sharing a desktop or window screen during the live event. This will allow your users to hear any audio part of the content you are sharing.

### Team and channel analytics

In addition to team analytics, now you can also view channel level metrics and insights. We've also enhanced the time period to 90 days so you can analyze data for longer periods. Apart from that, this release also includes new metrics and charts around the count of posts, replies, and meetings for a team or channel.

### Customize meeting video backgrounds

When you are meeting with video, you now have the choice of different static background images to use. This will let you show this image and not the actual background of where you are sitting. [Learn more](../meeting-policies-in-teams.md).
