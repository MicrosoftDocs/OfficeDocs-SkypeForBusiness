# Release notes for Microsoft Teams admin features

These release notes provide information about new admin features for Microsoft Teams.

## August 17, 2020

### Manage the praise app

The Praise app in Microsoft Teams helps users show appreciation to members of their organization or classroom. With a selection of badge sets to choose from and the option to create your own badges, Praise is designed to help recognize the effort that goes into the wide range of work that Teams users do, from educators to first line workers. [Learn more](../manage-praise-app.md).

### Tagging by Shift

With this feature, people are automatically assigned tags that match their schedule and shift group name in the Shifts app in Teams. [Learn more](../manage-tags).

## August 14, 2020

### Cortana voice skills in Teams

Cortana voice skills in Teams mobile app help users perform meeting, communication and collaboration tasks simply using spoken natural language. Users can speak to Cortana by clicking on the microphone button in Teams app and make requests like “Call Megan” or “Send a message to my next meeting” if they need to connect with someone while juggling household chores or walking the dog or generally on the go. Users can join meetings simply by saying “Join my next meeting” or check their calendar by asking “what do I have this morning”. Once in a meeting or a call, they can invoke Cortana from the overflow menu in the meeting stage and perform typical in-meeting tasks like adding people by name or number (“Add Megan to the call”), deck presentation (“present the quarterly review deck”) or navigating slides (“Go to the appendix slide”). Other things that the feature supports are finding and sharing files, search, and generally navigating within the Teams app (“Open my chat with John, Go to my unread activity, Go to my mentions etc.).

Cortana in Teams meets the same enterprise-level privacy, security, and compliance promises for Cortana enterprise services, as reflected in the [Online Services Terms (OST)](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/products?rtc=1).

### Teams Devices Administrator

Users with this role can manage Teams certified devices from the Teams admin center.
