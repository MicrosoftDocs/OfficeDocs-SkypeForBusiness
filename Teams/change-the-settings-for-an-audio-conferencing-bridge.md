# Change the settings for an Audio Conferencing bridge

When you are setting up Audio Conferencing in Office 365, you will receive phone numbers for your users from what is called an audio conferencing bridge. A conferencing bridge can contain one or more phone numbers. These phone numbers are used when callers dial in to a meeting. The phone number is included at the bottom of the Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams meeting invite.
  
The conferencing bridge answers a call and prompts the caller with voice prompts using a meeting auto attendant, and then, depending on your settings, it can play notifications, ask callers to record their name, and control the PIN settings. PINs are given to meeting organizers to allow them to start a meeting when they are aren't using a Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams app.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > A PIN is only required for the meeting organizer when a Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams app user hasn't already started the meeting. If everyone is dialing in to the meeting, the PIN is required for the meeting organizer to start the meeting. 

> [!NOTE]
