# Change the settings for an Audio Conferencing bridge

When you set up Audio Conferencing in Microsoft 365 or Office 365, you get phone numbers for your users through an audio conferencing bridge. A conferencing bridge can have one or more phone numbers that are included at the bottom of the meeting invite. These phone numbers allow users to join Microsoft Teams meetings by dialing in.

When a user dials in to a meeting using a phone, the conferencing bridge answers the call with voice prompts from the meeting auto attendant. Depending on your settings, the conferencing bridge can also play notifications, ask callers to record their name, and control the PIN settings. A PIN is assigned to meeting organizers to allow them to start their meetings if they can't use the Microsoft Teams app.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > A PIN is only required for the meeting organizer when a Teams app user hasn't already started the meeting. If everyone is dialing in to the meeting, the PIN is required for the meeting organizer to start the meeting.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [updating-admin-interfaces](includes/updating-admin-interfaces.md)]

## Manage audio conferencing bridges in the Teams admin center

1. Go to **Meetings** > **Conference bridges**.

2. At the top of the **Conference bridges** page, select **Bridge settings**.

3. In the **Bridge settings** pane, select:
   - **Meeting entry and exit notifications**- If you turn off this setting, users in the meeting aren't notified when someone enters or leaves the meeting.

     When you turn on **Meeting entry and exit notifications**, you can select one of these options:

     - **Names or phone numbers**- When users join a meeting by dialing in, their phone number is played.
       - Toggle **Ask callers to record their name before joining the meeting** **On** or **Off**. If you turn this off, callers aren't asked to record their name before they join a meeting.

     - **Tones**- When users join a meeting by dialing in, an audio tone is played.

4. To set the PIN length for meetings, select the number of digits you want for the PIN in the **PIN length** list.

5. To control whether to send email to your users when their settings are changed, toggle **Automatically send emails to users if their audio conferencing configuration changes** **On** or **Off**.
    For more information, see [Emails automatically sent to users when their Audio Conferencing settings change in Microsoft Teams](emails-sent-to-users-when-their-settings-change-in-teams.md).

6. Select **Save**.

 > [!NOTE]
   > By default, external participants can't see the phone numbers of dialed-in participants. If you want to maintain the privacy of these phone numbers, select **Tones** for **Entry/exit announcement type** (this prevents the numbers from being read out by Teams).
