# Evaluate your environment before upgrading to Teams

![Upgrade journey diagram, emphasizing the Technical Readiness stage.](media/upgrade-banner-tech-readiness.png "Stages of the upgrade journey, with emphasis on the Technical Readiness stage")

This article is part of the Technical Readiness stage of your upgrade journey, an activity you complete in parallel with the User Readiness stage. Before proceeding, confirm that you've completed these activities from previous stages:

- [Enlisted your project stakeholders](upgrade-enlist-stakeholders.md)
- [Defined your project scope](./upgrade-define-project-scope.md)
- [Understood coexistence and interoperability of Skype for Business and Teams](./teams-and-skypeforbusiness-coexistence-and-interoperability.md)
- [Chosen your upgrade journey](upgrade-and-coexistence-of-skypeforbusiness-and-teams.md)

This article gives an overview of the requirements for properly evaluating your current environment for operating Teams. By evaluating your environment, you identify risks and requirements that will influence your overall deployment. By identifying these items beforehand, you can adjust your planning to drive success.

## Introduction to the Discovery Questionnaire

To achieve your objective key results (OKRs), you previously made key service decisions. The next step is to perform environmental discovery to evaluate all aspects relating to your IT infrastructure, networking, and operations to confirm that your organization is ready to implement the solution. Discovery is one of the very first, key steps that you take when planning for your journey to Teams. Environmental discovery must include a network readiness assessment to ensure your network can support upgrading to Teams. You perform a detailed discovery of your environment to better understand its current state and to reveal any difficulties or—even more important—possible blockers to the execution of your Teams rollout.

You identify technical risks as part of an environmental assessment and adoption readiness evaluation, and develop a mitigation plan for each identified risk. You should incorporate this information in the risk register.

All matters related to your existing collaboration infrastructure and Microsoft 365 or Office 365 organization, networking, endpoints, operations, and adoption and readiness are included as part of the environmental discovery questionnaire. Work with your project team to provide the requested information with as much detail as possible to facilitate your planning activities.

[The questionnaire](upgrade-plan-journey-discovery-questionnaire.md) is divided into the following sections to confirm your organization's readiness for your Teams deployment in several major areas:

- Microsoft 365 or Office 365 organization details
- Existing collaboration platform summary
- Collaboration platform deployment details
- Networking and access to Microsoft 365 or Office 365 services
- Endpoints
- Operations
- Adoption and readiness

> [!TIP]
> You can start by copying the questionnaire into a Microsoft Word document. Try to answer all questions and capture all details as you move through.

## Project team

Ensure that you've engaged the right people for your project team. Verify the steps you completed in [Enlist your project stakeholders](upgrade-enlist-stakeholders.md).

After you evaluate your environment, proceed to the next step: [Prepare your service](upgrade-prepare-environment-prepare-service.md).
