# Prepare my service

This article gives an overview of the requirements for preparing cloud voice services for your organization. By preparing properly, you can be sure you’re ready to provide cloud voice capabilities to your organization.

## Onboarding checklists for Microsoft Teams voice workloads

The following checklists walk you through the steps for implementing Audio Conferencing, Phone System with Calling Plans (“Calling Plans”), and Phone System Direct Routing (“Direct Routing”) capabilities in Microsoft Teams.

*  [Prepare Office 365 for Teams](onboarding-checklist-enable-office-365.md)

*  [Configure Teams core capabilities](onboarding-checklist-configure-microsoft-teams-core-capabilities.md)

*  [Configure networking](onboarding-checklist-configure-networking.md)

*  [Configure cloud voice workloads in Teams](onboarding-checklist-configure-cloud-voice-workloads-in-Microsoft-Teams.md)

*  [Configure Direct Routing in Teams](onboarding-checklist-configure-direct-routing-in-Microsoft-Teams.md)

The tasks and activities in these checklists are the core “to-do” items that
apply to every deployment of cloud voice capabilities with Teams. You can
customize the checklists to include the activities and tasks that are specific
to your own Teams journey.

>[!NOTE]
>This guidance focuses solely on Calling Plans, Audio Conferencing, and Direct Routing. If you’re new to Teams, review [Overview of Microsoft Teams](teams-overview.md). For general
guidance for planning your Teams deployment, start with [Deploy chat, teams, channels, and apps in Microsoft Teams](deploy-chat-teams-channels-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md).

Use the provided checklists to track the status of each individual activity and task, and to be sure you haven’t skipped any critical steps. Each activity includes a detailed description of required actions and references to additional information that you can use to complete that activity.

Although we recommend that you follow the checklists in order, the exact sequence will depend on the scope of your deployment and the configuration and complexity of your environment. They’re organized to support either a “greenfield” Teams deployment (one with no previous Skype for Business Online presence) or migrating from Skype for Business Online to Teams. If you’re migrating from Skype for Business Online, you might have already completed some of these activities and can ignore them now.

When you’re onboarding users on a per-site basis, we highly recommended that you use the [Site Enablement Playbook for Voice (Playbook)](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/OfficeDocs-SkypeForBusiness/blob/live/Teams/downloads/site-enablement-playbook-for-voice-(playbook).xlsx?raw=true) as a supplementary guide to these checklists.

>[!NOTE]
>Most of the configuration settings are common between Teams and Skype for
Business Online. You use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center and Microsoft Teams admin center to configure those settings.

## Continue onboarding

After you complete these checklists, you’ll have successfully added voice capabilities to your Teams deployment.

As the next step, use the [Site Enablement Playbook for Voice (Playbook)](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/OfficeDocs-SkypeForBusiness/blob/live/Teams/downloads/site-enablement-playbook-for-voice-(playbook).xlsx?raw=true) to help you onboard your users on each site, and help ensure that you plan and execute important site-specific activities.

-   Ready Site by Site Rollout Plan

-   Establish Service Management Process

-   Execute Testing and Remediation

## Test cloud voice workloads in Teams

After you’ve defined and documented your Teams cloud voice business success and technical implementation plans as part of the Envision phase and undertaken the configuration you want in the admin center, the next step is to validate that your organization’s expectations and requirements are met through feature, functionality, and usability. You should perform this validation step before you deploy a pilot or final deployment in your production environment.

You can leverage the business success plan you defined during the Envision phase to serve as the basis for determining the activities, expectations, feature/functionality test cases, and overall scope to be evaluated during the testing phase.

## Define your testing approach

In its simplest form, your testing approach is based on your reviewing the feature capabilities of the Audio Conferencing, Calling Plans, or Direct Routing service and developing a test plan to verify that your functionality requirements are met for users in scope. The following is an example test plan for the Onboard phase of an audio conferencing implementation.


| Audio Conferencing feature to test | Results summary | Additional notes |
|------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Schedule an ad-hoc Teams meeting that contains audio conferencing dial-in information | Pass/Fail   | TBD |
| Use a phone for meeting audio by dialing into a meeting from the PSTN with the dial-in information provided | Pass/Fail | TBD |
| Join other people to an existing meeting by dialing out via the PSTN | Pass/Fail | TBD |



| Calling Plans or Direct Routing feature to test | Results summary | Additional notes |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Make a PSTN call by dialing a PSTN number       | Pass/Fail       | TBD |
| Receive a PSTN call by dialing your PSTN number from an external line (mobile, landline) | Pass/Fail | TBD|
| Transfer a PSTN call from one Teams user to another | Pass/Fail | TBD |


>[!TIP]
>To assist with test-case creation as a starting point, see the list
of user guidance available at [Teams Meetings and calls](https://support.office.com/article/Meetings-and-calls-d92432d5-dd0f-4d17-8f69-06096b6b48a8#bkmk_havingmeetings).

## Set up cloud voice workloads for Teams

Now that you’ve defined your testing approach, the next step is configuring your service environment and users in scope for Teams cloud voice features.

For additional information, see:

- [Technical Planning for Audio Conferencing](cloud-voice-deployment.md)

- [Set up Audio Conferencing for Microsoft Teams](set-up-audio-conferencing-in-teams.md)

- [Technical Planning for Phone System with Calling Plans](calling-plan-landing-page.md)

- [Set up Calling Plans for Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/skypeforbusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/set-up-calling-plans)
