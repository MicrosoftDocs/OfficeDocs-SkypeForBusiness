# Microsoft Teams adoption phase 1 - Start

You'll start your Teams adoption with the following activities:

- [Validate adoption prerequisites](#validate-adoption-prerequisites).
- [Assemble your team](#assemble-your-team).
- [Understand teams and channels](teams-adoption-understand-teams-and-channels.md).
- [Set up your first teams on Teams](teams-adoption-your-first-teams.md) to build your technical knowledge.
- [Assess your organization's readiness for change](teams-adoption-assess-readiness.md).

The primary goal of this phase is to ensure your readiness for the experimentation phase. You will also determine if you need assistance from Microsoft or from our network of skilled partners.  

## Validate adoption prerequisites

Review our [adoption prerequisites](teams-adoption-get-started.md#adoption-prerequisites) and work with the technical team to meet them if necessary. We'll address deeper technical requirements within each adoption scenario.

## Assemble your team

The table below lists the core roles for your project team. In a smaller organization, some of these roles may be carried out by the same person.

| Role | Responsibilities | Department |
| ---- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| Executive Sponsor<sup>1</sup> | Communicate high-level vision. Connect Teams implementation to core mission and priority initiatives at the company. | Executive Leadership |
| Success Owner<sup>1</sup> | Ensure the business goals are realized from the Teams rollout. | Any department |
| Program Manager<sup>1</sup> | Oversee the entire Teams launch execution and rollout process. | IT |
| Champions<sup>1</sup> | Help evangelize Teams, support skill building, and provide usage insights. | Multiple departments |
| Training Lead | Manage and communicate training content about Teams. | IT or other |
| Department Leads (Stakeholders)<sup>2</sup> | Identify how specific departments will use Teams and encourage engagement. | Any department (management) |
| IT Specialists<sup>1</sup> | Oversee all technical aspects of implementation, including integrations. | IT |
| Communication Lead<sup>2</sup> | Oversee company-wide communications about Teams. | Corporate Communications, IT, or other |
| Community Manager | Manage day-to-day Yammer network activity. Provide guidance and best practices. | Multiple departments |

<sup>1</sup>These roles are essential to the success of your project.</br>
<sup>2</sup>These roles are important for the overall program success.

In most cases, this initial team should be a small group of like-minded people who are interested in Teams and may also be accountable for its implementation. As your adoption plan moves on to additional phases, you will include more people in your team. We also suggest that you take advantage of the Microsoft resources that are available to assist you. 

## Additional resources

The [Microsoft Technical Community](https://aka.ms/TechCommunity) delivers peer-provided insights into adoption and technical issues for many Office 365 products. We suggest that you join the following communities:

- [Microsoft Teams Technical Community](https://aka.ms/TeamsCommunity) – Get product questions answered, learn from other Teams customers, and follow our blog to stay up to date on new features and use cases for Teams. 
- [Office 365 Champions Program](https://aka.ms/O365Champions) and the Driving Adoption community – Learn from your peers about how to best drive adoption of Office 365 workloads such as Teams, SharePoint, Yammer, and other products. Open to IT Pros, business users, the “accidental” developer, and anyone interested in driving adoption of cloud services.
