# How to create and configure resource accounts for Teams devices

This article provides steps to create resource accounts for shared spaces and devices, and it includes steps to configure resource accounts for Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows, Teams Rooms on Android, & Teams panels.

Microsoft 365 resource accounts are mailbox and Teams accounts that are dedicated to specific resources, such as a room or projector. These resource accounts can automatically respond to meeting invites using rules you define when they're created. For example, if you have a common resource such as a conference room, you can set up a resource account for that conference room which automatically accepts or declines meeting invites depending on its calendar availability.

Every resource account is unique to a single Microsoft Teams Rooms installation or Teams device implementation.

[!INCLUDE [mtr-device-config-account-include](../includes/m365-teams-resource-account-difference.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> If using Microsoft Teams panels, the same Teams Rooms resource account signs in to the Teams Rooms device and any associated Teams panels.

## Before you begin

### Requirements

You may need one or more roles to create, license, and configure resource accounts.

| Environment | Required Roles |
|-----|-----|
|Microsoft Entra ID |Global admin or User admin |
|On-premises Active Directory |Active Directory Enterprise Admins, Domain Admins, or have delegated rights to create users |
|Exchange Online |Global Administrator or Exchange Administrator  |
|Exchange Server |Exchange Organization Management or Recipient Management  |
|Licensing |Global admin or Billing admin |
|Teams |Global admin or Teams admin |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. Using lower permissioned accounts helps improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to emergency scenarios when you can't use an existing role.

## Get the right license

[!INCLUDE [mtr-device-config-license-include](../includes/mtr-device-config-license-include.md)]

## Create resource account & assign the license

[!INCLUDE [mtr-device-config-account-include](../includes/mtr-device-config-account-include.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're creating resource accounts for Teams Rooms, the resource account's UPN must match the SMTP address of the resource account.

## Configure Exchange mailbox properties

[!INCLUDE [mtr-device-config-mailbox-include](../includes/mtr-device-config-mailbox-include.md)]

## Turn off password expiration

[!INCLUDE [mtr-device-config-password-include](../includes/mtr-device-config-password-include.md)]

## Next steps

### Teams policies

[!INCLUDE [mtr-device-config-policies-include](../includes/mtr-device-config-policies-include.md)]

### Calling

Resource accounts can be enabled for public switched telephone network (PSTN) the same way you enable a regular user. For more information, see [Calling in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/cloud-voice-landing-page). We also recommend disabling voicemail for shared devices with a calling policy. For more information, see [Calling policies in Teams](../teams-calling-policy.md).

### Conditional Access

Conditional access controls resource accounts for Teams devices. You may need to make modifications to your existing policies to ensure your resource accounts are secure and functional. For more information on supported configurations and changes you may need to make, see [Conditional access for Teams devices](/microsoftteams/rooms/conditional-access-and-compliance-for-devices).

> [!NOTE]
> Teams shared devices do not support Security defaults in Microsoft Entra ID. Use conditional access to secure your environment and Teams shared devices.
