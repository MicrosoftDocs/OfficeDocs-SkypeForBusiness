# Create and configure resource accounts for rooms and shared Teams devices

This article provides steps to create resource accounts for shared spaces and devices, and it includes steps to configure resource accounts for Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows, Teams Rooms on Android, Teams Rooms on Surface Hub, and hot-desking on Teams displays.

Microsoft 365 resource accounts are mailbox and Teams accounts that are dedicated to specific resources, such as a room or projector. These resource accounts can automatically respond to meeting invites using rules you define when they're created. For example, if you have a common resource such as a conference room, you can set up a resource account for that conference room that will automatically accept or decline meeting invites depending on its calendar availability. 

Every resource account is unique to a single Microsoft Teams Rooms installation or Teams display hot-desking implementation.

> [!NOTE]
> If using Microsoft Teams panels, the Teams Rooms resource account signs in to both Teams Rooms and associated Teams panels.

> If you need to enable your resource account to work with Skype for Business, see [Deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms with Skype for Business Server](with-skype-for-business-server-2015.md)

## Before you begin

### Calling

There are no unique requirements to enable calling with resource accounts. You enable the resource account for calling in the same way you enable a regular user.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend turning off voice mail for shared devices by assigning a calling policy to the device resource accounts. See [Calling and call-forwarding in Teams](../teams-calling-policy.md) for more information.
