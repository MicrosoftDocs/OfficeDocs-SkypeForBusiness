# Record an issue ticket

For any type of incident that MTR Pro did not flag, or to simply keep track of issues on an MTR or space, customers or partners on behalf of customers can use the Record an issue feature.

In the Description field, describe as best as possible the issue that you need help with from Microsoft. You can add one or more rooms.

Check  **High Impact** if the incident is causing significant health degradation for the service or for a critical room. To help Microsoft properly prioritize your request, describe in detail the reason this is high impact.

> [!NOTE]
> Do not use this field for general questions, rooms, and/or issues that do not have available mitigation.

When a room is (or rooms are) selected as part of the Record an issue, each room will be marked as **Unhealthy** until the recorded issue is closed.

## Closing Record an issue tickets

Recorded issues can be closed by either the customer or partners managing rooms on behalf of customers.

**To close an recorded issue ticket**

1. Select **Close ticket**.

2. Choose a reason for closure by selecting a category from the list.

   Once you've confirmed the reason for closure, the ticket is closed and moved to **Resolved**.

The ticket's Details Overview section displays that the ticket was closed by the Managed Rooms Service (Microsoft) or the name of the customer/partner.  

## FAQ

**Can anyone close tickets?**

Only Customer-reported incidents can be closed by a user. Customers who have assigned a Partner to manage their rooms with Ticket Management permissions will have the ability to close recorded issue tickets.

**Can I restrict who can close tickets?**

Not at this time. All users who have Ticket Management permissions can close a recorded issue ticket.

**Do I get notified when a Record an issue ticket closes?**

Not at this time.
