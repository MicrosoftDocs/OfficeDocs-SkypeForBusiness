description: Remote management of the default settings used by a Microsoft Teams Rooms device and creating a master settings file.

# Manage a Microsoft Teams Rooms console settings remotely with an XML configuration file

This article discusses remote management of the default settings used by a Microsoft Teams Rooms device. It discusses how to create a master settings file and links to discussions of how to place them as needed on Teams Rooms.
  
It is possible for you to change default settings of Teams Rooms by updating a master XML file and sending copies to the remote Teams Rooms devices.

> [!NOTE]
> Some features are available only on Teams Rooms devices that have been assigned a Microsoft Teams Rooms Pro license. To see which features require Microsoft Teams Rooms Pro, see [Microsoft Teams Rooms licenses](rooms-licensing.md).

## Manage console settings with an XML configuration file

At startup, if a Microsoft Teams Rooms console finds an XML file named SkypeSettings.xml located at `C:\Users\Skype\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.SkypeRoomSystem_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState`, it applies the configuration settings indicated by the XML file then deletes the XML file.
  
Depending on how many Microsoft Teams Rooms devices your enterprise has and how you choose to manage to configure them, there are several ways to place the XML configuration file. Once the file is pushed to the console, restart it to process the configuration changes. The XML configuration file is deleted after it is successfully processed. The management methods suggested for Microsoft Teams Rooms devices are discussed in:
  
- [Configuring Group Policy for Microsoft Teams Rooms](rooms-operations.md#GroupPolicy)
- [Remote Management using PowerShell](rooms-operations.md#RemotePS) and [Configure a File Item](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc772536(v=ws.11))

You can use any method you like so long as you can use it to transfer files and trigger a restart on the console device. The file must be readable, writable, and delete-able by the device's local user account. Preferably it is owned by, and has full privileges granted to, device's local user. If the file permissions are not set correctly, the software can fail to apply the settings, can fail to delete the file upon successful processing, and can even potentially crash.
  
## Create an XML configuration file

Any text editor can be used to create a settings file. The **XML Elements** table explains the elements shown in this sample SkypeSettings.xml (required file name) configuration file.

If a variable value is of the wrong type, elements are out of order, elements are unclosed, or another error is found, the XML file is *badly formed*. While processing a badly formed XML file, settings found up to the point where the error occurs are applied, then the rest of the file is ignored. Any unknown elements in the XML are ignored. If a parameter is omitted, it remains unchanged on the device. If a parameter value is invalid, its prior value remains unchanged.

| `<TrustedAccounts>` | String |  | This is a comma-separated list of UPNs for each Teams Rooms device or Surface Hub that the device should accept meeting join requests from, or to which meeting join requests should be sent. |
| `<Settings>` | Container |  | Container for the configuration audio and video configuration elements for Coordinated Meetings. |
| `<Audio>` | Boolean &#x2777; |  | Controls audio configuration on a Teams Rooms device. This element has two attributes:<br><ul><li><b>default</b> Determines on which device the microphone will be active when a meeting starts. Only one device (typically a Teams Rooms device) can have this field set to `true` while the rest of the devices must have this field set to `false` to avoid audio echo and feedback.</li><li><b>enabled</b> Determines whether participants in a meeting can toggle the microphone on or off. Devices on which **Audio default** is set to `false` should have this setting set to `false` so that participants can't accidentally turn on a microphone and cause audio echo or feedback.<p>If **Audio default** is set to `true`, the **Audio enabled** setting is ignored and participants can mute or unmute the microphone.</li></ul> |
| `<Video>` | Boolean &#x2777; |  | Controls video configuration on a Teams Rooms device. This element has two attributes:<br><ul><li><b>default</b> Determines on which device the camera will be active when a meeting starts. For the best experience, we recommend that only the Teams Rooms device be set to `true` while all other devices are set to `false`.</li><li><b>enabled</b> Determines whether participants in a meeting can toggle the camera on or off. You can set this to `true` on any other devices in the event participants want to share different video perspectives (such as if a participant is using the Surface Hub whiteboard). If you don't want participants to turn a camera on or off on a device, set this to `false`.<p> If **Video default** is set to `true`, the **Video enabled** setting is ignored and participants can turn the camera on or off.</li></ul> |
| `<Whiteboard>` | Boolean &#x2777; |  | Controls whiteboard configuration on a Teams Rooms device. This element has two attributes:<br><ul><li><b>default</b> Determines on which device the whiteboard will be active when a meeting starts. For the best experience, we recommend that the Teams Rooms device be set to `false` and that you use the whiteboard on a Surface Hub.</li><li><b>enabled</b> Determines whether participants in a meeting can toggle the whiteboard on or off. If you don't want participants to turn the whiteboard on or off on a device, set this to `false`.<p> If **Whiteboard default** is set to `true`, the **Whiteboard enabled** setting is ignored and participants can turn the whiteboard on or off.</li></ul> |
| `<EnableDeviceEndToEndEncryption>` | Boolean &#x2777; |  | Default is `false`. Specify `true` to enable end-to-end encryption for one-to-one Teams calls. Both caller and recipient need to have end-to-end encryption enabled for this to work. |
| `<SplitVideoLayoutsDisabled>` | Boolean &#x2777; |  | Default is `false`. This setting is only applicable to dual-display rooms. Specify `true` to disable splitting video gallery across both screens. This will also disable Front row layout, and any settings associated with Front row layout. |

&#x2776; All of the first-level elements are optional. If a first-level element is omitted, all of its child parameters remain unchanged on the device.
  
&#x2777; A boolean flag can be: true, false, 0, or 1. Leaving boolean or numeric values empty can render the XML malformed and prevent changes to the settings.
  
&#x2778; If a string parameter is present and empty, and empty is a valid value, the parameter is cleared on the device.
