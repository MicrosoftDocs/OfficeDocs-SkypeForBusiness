# Manage a Microsoft Teams Rooms console settings remotely with an XML configuration file

This article discusses remote management of the default settings used by a Microsoft Teams Rooms device, including applying a custom theme. It discusses how to create a master settings file and links to discussions of how to place them as needed on Teams Rooms.
  
It is possible for you to change default settings of Teams Rooms by updating a master XML file and sending copies to the remote Teams Rooms devices.
  
## Create an XML configuration file

Any text editor can be used to create a settings file. The **XML Elements** table explains the elements shown in this sample SkypeSettings.xml (required file name) configuration file.
  
```XML

```

If a variable value is of the wrong type, elements are out of order, elements are unclosed, or another error is found, the XML file is *badly formed*. While processing a badly formed XML file, settings found up to the point where the error occurs are applied, then the rest of the file is ignored. Any unknown elements in the XML are ignored. If a parameter is omitted, it remains unchanged on the device. If a parameter value is invalid, its prior value remains unchanged.

This element has two attributes:<br><ul><li><b>default</b> Determines on which device the camera will be active when a meeting starts. For the best experience, we recommend that only the Teams Rooms device be set to `true` while all other devices are set to `false`.</li><li><b>enabled</b> Determines whether participants in a meeting can toggle the camera on or off. You can set this to `true` on any other devices in the event participants want to share different video perspectives (such as if a participant is using the Surface Hub whiteboard).

&#x2776; All of the first-level elements are optional. If a first-level element is omitted, all of its child parameters remain unchanged on the device.
  
&#x2777; A boolean flag can be: true, false, 0, or 1. Leaving boolean or numeric values empty can render the XML malformed and prevent changes to the settings.
  
&#x2778; If a string parameter is present and empty, and empty is a valid value, the parameter is cleared on the device.
  
## Manage console settings with an XML configuration file

At startup, if a Microsoft Teams Rooms console finds an XML file named SkypeSettings.xml located at `C:\Users\Skype\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.SkypeRoomSystem_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState`, it applies the configuration settings indicated by the XML file then deletes the XML file.
  
Depending on how many Microsoft Teams Rooms devices your enterprise has and how you choose to manage to configure them, there are several ways to place the XML configuration file. Once the file is pushed to the console, restart it to process the configuration changes. The XML configuration file is deleted after it is successfully processed. The management methods suggested for Microsoft Teams Rooms devices are discussed in:
  
- [Configuring Group Policy for Microsoft Teams Rooms](rooms-operations.md#GroupPolicy)
- [Remote Management using PowerShell](rooms-operations.md#RemotePS) and [Configure a File Item](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc772536(v=ws.11))

You are free to use any method you like so long as you can use it to transfer files and trigger a restart on the console device. The file must be readable, writable, and delete-able by the device's local user account. Preferably it is owned by and has full privileges granted to that user. If the file permissions are not set correctly, the software can fail to apply the settings, can fail to delete the file upon successful processing, and can even potentially crash.

## Custom Theme Images

<a name="Themes"> </a>

The custom theme image file must be placed in the`C:\Users\Skype\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.SkypeRoomSystem_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState` folder. Enter the file name and extension in the \<CustomThemeImageUrl\> variable.
  
The image file should be exactly 3840X1080 pixels and must be one of the following file formats: jpg, jpeg, png, and bmp. If your organization wants a custom image, a graphic designer can use the [Custom Theme Photoshop Template](../downloads/ThemingTemplateMicrosoftTeamsRooms_v2.1.psd). It contains further detail on where various user interface elements are relative to the rest of a theme image and what areas appear on consoles and displays.
  
The XML configuration file must be updated at device startup to recognize the theme image. Once the new XML file is processed and deleted, the theme graphic file is deleted from the directory.

## Locate the Content camera USB instance path

To locate the instance path:

1. Go into Windows settings on the Microsoft Teams Rooms console.
2. Enter the admin password.
3. From a Command Prompt, type `devmgmt.msc` to bring up Device Manager.
4. In **Device Manager**, look in the **Imaging devices** node and  locate the content camera.
5. Right-click the camera, and open **Properties**.
6. Select the **Details** tab, and locate the **Device instance path** property in the drop-down.
7. The value shown is the device instance path to set in the XML configuration file. When specifying the path in XML, replace the ampersand (&) with `&amp;`.
