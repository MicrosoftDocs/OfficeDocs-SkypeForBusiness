# Manage voice recognition technology controls for an Intelligent Speaker

An Intelligent Speaker uses voice profile information to recognize who said what in live transcription. When a Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows meeting room is equipped with an Intelligent Speaker, live transcription can be used during the meeting. This article explains how you, a tenant admin, control the voice profiling that's used for voice recognition to generate live transcription. You can control to what degree the organization is using voice recognition and the following features:

- Edit the speaker's name in transcripts.
- Change the speaker of a single utterance in the transcript or change the speaker in all the utterances in the transcript (but not on future transcripts).
- Change the speaker identification for the people who are listed in the meeting.
- Remove the identification of one or more utterances identified as that speaker, on every transcript.

## Review Intelligent Speaker requirements

An Intelligent Speaker includes a special seven-microphone array. The system uses voice profile information to identify voices of up to 10 people in meeting rooms.

The following items are Intelligent Speaker requirements:

- The meeting room should have a maximum of 10 people present in person.
- The meeting room has an upload link of minimum 7 Mbps.

Epos, Sennheiser, and Yealink intelligent speakers are supported.

> [!NOTE]
> Intelligent Speaker is available in all countries and regions. See [Supported locales](#supported-locales) for a list of the locales currently supported for biometric enrollment and in-meeting transcription.

## Set up an Intelligent Speaker

An Intelligent Speaker connects directly using USB to the Teams Rooms console.

> [!NOTE]
> A Yealink Intelligent Speaker **must** be used with a Yealink console.

> [!NOTE]
> We don't support an Intelligent Speaker connected to Logitech Surface Pro Microsoft Teams Rooms. There is a known issue that Teams Rooms can't recognize the Intelligent Speaker through the dock.

An Intelligent Speaker should be placed at least 8 inches (20 cm) away from walls and large objects, such as laptops. If the Intelligent Speaker USB cable isn't long enough for your setup, use cable extenders.

1. Sign in to the console as administrator.
2. Set the Teams device settings to match the Intelligent Speaker microphone and speaker.
   You can also do this through the TAC portal instead of at the room console.

   The diagram shows how the Intelligent Speaker is connected to the device if the device includes a data box.

   The diagram shows how the Intelligent Speaker is connected to the device if the device doesn't include a data box.

> [!NOTE]
> EPOS and Yealink devices should have "EPOS" or "Yealink" prefix and contain "UAC2_RENDER" in the speaker name and "UAC2_TEAMS" in the microphone name. If you don't find these microphone and speaker names in the dropdown menu, restart the Intelligent Speaker device.

## Enable an Intelligent Speaker user recognition

Voice profile data can be used in any meeting with an Intelligent Speaker. See [Teams meetings policies](../meetings-policies-recording-and-transcription.md#transcription) and the [PowerShell meeting cmdlets](/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamsmeetingpolicy) for information on the meeting settings.

The voice profile data of the user is created when the policy is set to distinguish or a non-meeting invitee walks in during the meeting. The voice profile data is dismissed at the end of the meeting.

The following are the required policies to set an Intelligent Speaker and user recognition.

|Policy|Description|Values and Behavior|
|-|-|-|
|enrollUserOverride|Use to set voice profile capture, or enrollment, in Teams settings for a tenant. |**Disabled**<br><ul><li> Users who have never enrolled can't view, enroll, or re-enroll.<li>The entry point to the enrollment flow will be hidden.<li>If users select a link to the enrollment page, they'll see a message that states this feature isn't enabled for their organization.  <li>Users who have enrolled can view and remove their voice profile in the Teams settings.

In the Teams admin center, set the **Transcription** policy. Settings are **Off** by default.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

**Where is the voice profile data stored?**

Voice profile data is stored in Office 365 cloud with user content.

**What is the retention timeline and policy?**

General retention policy is stated in the [Data retention overview](/compliance/assurance/assurance-data-retention-deletion-and-destruction-overview). In addition, a user's voice profile data will be deleted after 1 year if the user isn't invited to any meetings with an Intelligent Speaker within that 1-year period. Data isn't used in any meetings for existing employees. If an employee has left the company, voice profile data is considered user content and is treated as such per Office 365 data retention policy described in the [Data retention overview](/compliance/assurance/assurance-data-retention-deletion-and-destruction-overview).

**Is voice profile data used across Microsoft services?**

No, voice profile data is only used for the purpose for which the user has provided consent. Microsoft will not use the voice profile data except within Teams voice recognition scenarios.

For example, Microsoft won't use the data in the following situations:

**Is my voice profile data used when I join a meeting in another organization?**

No only in meetings organized by a user in your organization.

**How can I export my voice profile?**

Your IT admin can export your audio data at any time.
