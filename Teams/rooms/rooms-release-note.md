# Release notes for Microsoft Teams Rooms

This article discusses cumulative improvements in Microsoft Teams Rooms.

There are two types of updates for Teams Rooms: Teams Rooms app updates and Teams Web-client. 

Teams Rooms app updates happen either via the Microsoft Store or via [manual update](manual-update.md). Updates are applied to the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application that is installed locally on the device.

Teams Web client updates happen via the Teams web app delivery services. The Teams web client is a cloud-based service that doesn't require an update to the local UWP application installed on the device.

For more information on how Teams updates, see [Teams update process](../teams-client-update.md)

Teams Rooms is governed by the Modern Lifecycle Policy. For more information, see [Teams update process](../teams-client-update.md#servicing-agreement).
