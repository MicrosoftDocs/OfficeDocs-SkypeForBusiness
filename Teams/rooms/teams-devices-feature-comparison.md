# Teams Rooms on Windows and Android feature comparison

Microsoft Teams Rooms experiences are designed with customers in mind. Every customer has unique needs, which is why Microsoft offers a breadth of options, including Teams Rooms on Windows and on Android. 

Core functionality is available on both platforms so end users can always have great audio and video experiences, use one-touch join to join meetings, and access inclusive features such as live captions and raise hand. 

As Microsoft brings new features to Teams and to Teams Rooms, we strive to bring them to all platforms, but features may roll out at different times due to a number of factors, including things like technical feasibility and customer feedback for each platform. This means you may see some features rolling out on Windows before they come to the Android platform. 

To help guide you as to what features are available on different platforms, you can refer to the chart below, which will be updated periodically. Not all Teams Rooms features will be included on this list, so please continue to consult the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap) and Microsoft sales representatives for additional details.
