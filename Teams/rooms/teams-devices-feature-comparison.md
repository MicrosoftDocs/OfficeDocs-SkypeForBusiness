# Teams Device feature comparison (Windows, Android, & Panels)

Microsoft Teams Rooms experiences are designed with customers in mind. Every customer has unique needs, which is why Microsoft offers a breadth of options, including Teams Rooms on Windows and on Android as well as Teams panels mounted outside of the conference room. 

Core functionality is available on all platforms so end users can always have great audio and video experiences, use one-touch join to join meetings, and access inclusive features. 

As Microsoft brings new features to Teams and to Teams Rooms, we strive to bring them to all platforms, but features may roll out at different times due to many factors, including things like technical feasibility and customer feedback for each platform. This means you may see some features rolling out on Windows before they come to the Android platform. Items listed here are supported in the Teams application, confirm supportability with the hardware vendor you select.

To help guide you as to what features are available on different platforms, you can refer to the chart (government tenants can refer to the respective tabs), which is updated periodically. Not all Teams Rooms features will be included on this list, continue to consult the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap) and Microsoft sales representatives for more information.
