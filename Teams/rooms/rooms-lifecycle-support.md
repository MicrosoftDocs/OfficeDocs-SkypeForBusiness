# Microsoft Teams Rooms app version support
 
The Microsoft Teams Rooms app gets updates a few times per year. Each update supported for twelve (12) months from its general availability (GA) release date. Technical support is provided for the entire twelve (12) months. However, the support structure is dynamic, with two distinct phases that depend on the availability of the latest version:

- **Servicing and Critical Updates phase** \- When you run the latest version of the Microsoft Teams Rooms app, you receive regular updates that contain *Security and Servicing* updates.

- **Security Updates Only phase** \- When a new version of the Microsoft Teams Rooms app releases, older versions of the app have a reduced support level with *Security updates only* for the rest of the twelve (12) month lifecycle.

> [!NOTE]
> The latest version is always in the Servicing and Critical Updates phase. When you encounter a code defect that warrants a critical update, you must also have the latest version installed to receive a fix. All other supported versions will only be eligible to receive security updates.

All support ends after the twelve (12) month lifecycle for a version has expired or if more than two updates have been released since then. Then, customers must update to a supported version.

All releases are listed in the [Microsoft Teams Rooms release notes](rooms-release-note.md).

## Windows 10 release support

Microsoft Teams Rooms requires the  Windows 10 IoT Enterprise or Windows 10 Enterprise SKUs under Semi-Annual Channel servicing options. These other Windows 10 editions aren't supported:

- Windows 10 Enterprise Long-term Servicing Branch (LTSB) / Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) editions
- Windows 10 Internet of Things (IoT) Enterprise LTSB / LTSC editions
- any other edition of Windows such as Windows 10 Pro or Home edition

A Windows 10 feature update isn't offered or updated on Microsoft Teams Rooms devices immediately. An intentional delay of up to six months after the general availability date published on the [Windows 10 release information](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/release-information/) page. The delay time is used to validate the Windows 10 release compatibility for the Microsoft Teams Rooms application, device hardware, and certified audio video peripherals. Validation begins and continues during active development of each major release of Windows 10. Extra time is needed to validate that all device manufacturers have built updated images for their devices, and for Microsoft Teams to certify and test those images. During the validation period, the Microsoft Teams Room app  uses  [Windows Update for Business group policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/update/waas-manage-updates-wufb) to delay Windows 10 feature updates. After any compatibility issues are found and resolved, the block is lifted via updating group policies through a new app release in Windows store. Devices that run the Microsoft Teams Rooms app automatically update to an appropriate Windows 10 release during the nightly maintenance reboot. An MSI version is made available for customers that wish to manually manage updates.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During the validation period, Microsoft Teams Rooms devices should **not** be updated to the next release of Windows 10 by any means. This includes overriding the group policies in place, or using System Center or other third-party device management services. Any of these may cause issues for the Microsoft Teams Room application or may leave devices unusable.  

The following table shows recommended and supported versions of Windows 10 that are verified to support Microsoft Teams Rooms. All dates are listed in ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD.

&#x2780; Windows 10 version 1809 is not recommended due to compatibility issues found with the Microsoft Teams Rooms application. This specific issue causes the Microsoft Teams Rooms application to fail to start after the nightly reboot. This issue was addressed in  Windows 10 version 1903.  

&#x2781; Windows 10 version 2004 is not recommended due to compatibility issues found with the Microsoft Teams Rooms application. This specific issue causes the Microsoft Teams Rooms application to fail to start after the nightly reboot.
