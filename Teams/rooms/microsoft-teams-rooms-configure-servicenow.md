## Configure your environment

How your environment is configured is highly customizable and will depend on your organization's needs. The following steps walk through how to copy your existing configuration in ServiceNow to the Teams Rooms Pro Management portal.

1. Open the ServiceNow instance you want to copy. You'll need to reference this as you complete the configuration form in the Teams Rooms Pro Management portal.
2. In a new browser tab, go to the [Teams Rooms Pro Management portal](https://portal.rooms.microsoft.com/) and go to **Settings**. Then, select **ServiceNow** in the left navigation menu to open the configuration form.
3. Select an authentication method to sign in and enter your ServiceNow Instance Host and API URI.
4. All required items in the ServiceNow Field column of the Field Mapping section should be pre-filled. The table below contains each ServiceNow field and its corresponding Microsoft Teams Rooms field. Complete the action for each row of the Field Mapping section. For definitions of each ServiceNow field, see [ServiceNow field definitions](#servicenow-field-definitions).

| ServiceNow field | Microsoft Teams Rooms field | Action |

| description | First Message | No action needed. The Teams Rooms field is auto-filled. |

| Comments (optional) | Custom value* | To add a comments field to the configuration form, select **Add** at the top of the field  mapping section.
