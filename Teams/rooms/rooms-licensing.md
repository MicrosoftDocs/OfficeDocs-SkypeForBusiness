# Microsoft Teams Rooms licenses

Microsoft offers two licenses for meeting room devices that participate in Teams meetings and calls:

- **Microsoft Teams Rooms Pro** delivers enhanced in-room meeting experiences like intelligent audio and video, front row and large galleries, and dual-screen support. The Teams Rooms Pro licenses also provides advanced management features like remote device management, conditional access policies, and detailed device analytics.

    Teams Rooms Pro is a great fit for medium and enterprise organizations, as well as smaller organizations with larger room counts or more advanced needs.

- **Microsoft Teams Rooms Basic** provides core meeting experiences to organizations that purchase a certified Microsoft Teams Rooms device, at no additional cost. The Teams Rooms Basic license includes scheduling, joining meetings, content sharing, and collaborative white boarding, as well as basic security and management capabilities out-of-the-box.

    You can assign up to 25 Microsoft Teams Rooms Basic licenses to Teams Rooms devices in your organization. If you need to license more than 25 devices, those additional licenses need to be Teams Rooms Pro licenses.

A Teams Rooms Basic license can be used to license a single certified Teams Rooms device in a room. If you want to log into more than one device in a room using the same resource account (for example, a Teams Rooms console, a Surface Hub, and a Teams panel), you need to use a Teams Rooms Pro license.

[Communication Credits](../what-are-communications-credits.md) may apply for additional services, such as toll-free, international minutes for domestic plans, and so on. You can disable these features to avoid additional billing.

<sup>2</sup> Included to enable certain legacy authentication methods.

<sup>3</sup> You need to add and assign a free Teams Rooms Basic license for each device via the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## Switching from Teams Rooms Standard and Teams Rooms Premium

If your organization has meeting devices that use the Teams Rooms Standard or Teams Rooms Premium legacy licenses, you can continue using those licenses until their expiration date. Upon the expiration date of your existing legacy licenses, we recommend that you transition to the Teams Rooms Pro license. The meeting and management features<sup>*</sup> available in both of the legacy licenses have been combined in the Teams Rooms Pro license.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Legacy licenses won't automatically transition to the new licenses. Upon expiration of a legacy license, you'll need to purchase a new Teams Rooms Pro (recommended) or Teams Rooms Basic license. Teams Rooms Pro licenses can be purchased through the Microsoft 365 admin center or your preferred sales channel. Teams Rooms Basic licenses can only be purchased through the Microsoft 365 admin center.

If your organization has an Enterprise Agreement, you can continue using your existing legacy licenses until your next renewal period. You can also continue to reserve additional legacy licenses until your next renewal period. For more information, contact your Microsoft representative.

<sup>*</sup>Microsoft Service engineers will no longer serve as intermediaries to incident response starting October 1, 2022.

## Teams Rooms console and Teams client feature comparison

The following tables compare the Teams Rooms Basic and Teams Rooms Pro licenses and show what features are available with each. If a feature isn't available for a license, that feature can't be used on Teams Rooms devices that have been assigned that license. To use a feature on a Teams Rooms device, assign the license in which that feature is available to that device.
