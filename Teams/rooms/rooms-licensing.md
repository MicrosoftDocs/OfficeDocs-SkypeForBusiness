# Teams Meeting Room Licensing Update

## Licensing Solutions for Shared Communication Devices

Microsoft has two dedicated SKUs for licensing meetings and calling on a per-device basis for meeting room devices (such as Microsoft Teams Rooms, Microsoft Surface Hub, and collaboration bars for Microsoft Teams).

|&nbsp;|Microsoft Teams Rooms Standard |Microsoft Teams Rooms Premium |
|:--- |:---: |:---: |
|Microsoft Teams|  &#x2714;|  &#x2714;|
|Phone System|  &#x2714;|  &#x2714;|

|Channel Availability | EA, EAS, CSP, <br/>Web Direct | EA, EAS, CSP, <br/>Web Direct |

&sup1; Availability and included minutes may vary by region. To verify service availability, refer to  [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](/microsoftteams/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans). Consumption charges may apply for additional services, such as toll-free, international minutes for domestic plans, etc. Customers can disable these features to avoid additional billing.  

&sup2; Not available in sovereign clouds  

&sup3; For more information and availability, see [Microsoft Teams Rooms managed service](microsoft-teams-rooms-premium.md).

Both licenses contain entitlements for Skype for Business Online, which was retired on July 31, 2021.

The following table lists the features that are available in Microsoft Teams Rooms and what licenses you need to buy to get them.
  
> [!NOTE]
> The room that is being set up needs to be a user object and have these licenses assigned to it.
