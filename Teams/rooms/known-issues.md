| Application not launching |  After updating to application version 4.4.41.0, the system boots to black screen, or go to the logon screen after few minutes. | Follow the steps in [Microsoft Teams Rooms application does not start after update to version 4.4.41.0](/microsoftteams/troubleshoot/teams-administration/teams-rooms-app-wont-start-after-update) to fix this issue.  | None |
|  SfB meetings content sharing does not show full screen         |    In Skype for Business meetings, rooms with front of room displays using high DPI settings may experience issues where content shared into a meeting doesn't show the full screen on the front of room display. This is caused by an underlying issue in the Windows 10 Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) API. | Use the `<WinRTRdpEnabled>` XML setting to disable the Windows 10 RDP API to resolve this issue. To disable, you need to specify the value as `false`. For more information, see [Managing console settings with an XML configuration file](xml-config-file.md#manage-console-settings-with-an-xml-configuration-file). | None |
|  App out of date         |    The Microsoft Teams Rooms console shows a "system config out of date" error.                |   [Use the Microsoft Teams Rooms recovery tool](recovery-tool.md)             |  None |
|  Device updated to unsupported version of Windows 10   |    Windows 10 device updated from version 1803 to version 1809, which is not supported. The supported version is 1903. |   This can happen if the [Group Policy or MDM setting for DeferFeatureUpdatesPeriodinDays](/windows/deployment/update/waas-configure-wufb) setting, which lets you defer feature updates for a specified number of days, is set to the maximum of 365 days. <br><br> Windows 10 version 1809 isn't supported with Microsoft Teams Rooms, while version 1903 is supported. However, as of March 27, 2020, version 1809 is over 365 days old. If this setting isn't changed, Windows attempts to install version 1809, which may cause issues with Microsoft Teams Rooms.<br><br>To avoid this situation, **remove** any Group Policy or MDM setting for deferring updates. This allows Windows to update to the latest, supported OS version. <br><br>**IMPORTANT** The Group Policy or MDM setting must be **removed** (left unconfigured) and **not set to 0**. If the policy is set to 0, Windows takes the latest available version which may not be supported. |  None |

## Limitations and expected behaviors

***

Microsoft Teams Rooms does not support HDCP input, which has been observed to cause issues with HDMI ingest functionality (video, audio). Take care to ensure that switches connected to Microsoft Teams Rooms have HDCP options turned off. 

***

If you desire a front of room display to automatically switch to an active video source (such as an MTR console) when the source wakes from standby mode, certain conditions must be met. This feature is optional but supported by Microsoft Teams Rooms software, provided underlying hardware supports the feature. A consumer TV used as a front of room display needs to support the Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) feature of HDMI.  Depending on the dock or console selected (which might not support CEC, refer to manufacturer support documentation), a controller such as an [HD-RX-201-C-E](https://www.crestron.com/Products/Video/HDMI-Solutions/HDMI-Extenders/HD-RX-201-C-E) from Crestron or [Extron HD CTL 100](https://www.extron.com/article/hdctl100ad) from Extron may be needed to enable the desired behavior. 

***

Always use a wired 1-Gbps network connection to assure you have the needed bandwidth. 

***

If your Microsoft Teams Rooms device loses trust with the domain, you won't be able to authenticate into the device and open up Settings. For example, if you remove the Microsoft Teams Rooms from the domain after it is domain joined, trust is lost. The workaround is to log in with the local Admin account. 
***
Microsoft Teams Rooms is a multi-window application and requires a front of room display to be connected to the HDMI port of the device, for the app to function correctly. Make sure that you either have an HDMI display connected or use a dummy HDMI plug if you are testing and do not have a display purchased yet.
