# Deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms with Office 365

Read this topic for information on how to deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms with Office 365.

## Requirements

Before you deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms with Office 365, be sure you have met the requirements. For more information, see [Microsoft Teams Rooms requirements](requirements.md).

### Add a resource account

1. Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell. For instructions, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=396554).

2. In Exchange Online PowerShell, create a new room mailbox or modify an existing room mailbox. By default, room mailboxes don't have associated accounts. You'll need to add an account when you create or modify a room mailbox that allows it to authenticate.

   - To create a new room mailbox, use the following syntax:

     ``` PowerShell
     New-Mailbox -Name '<Unique Name>' -Alias <Alias> -Room -EnableRoomMailboxAccount $true -MicrosoftOnlineServicesID <Account> -RoomMailboxPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String '<Password>' -AsPlainText -Force)
     ```

     This example creates a new room mailbox with the following settings:

     - Name: Conference Room 01

     - Alias: ConferenceRoom01

     - Account: ConferenceRoom01@contoso.com

     - Account password: P@$$W0rd5959

     ``` PowerShell
     New-Mailbox -Name 'Conference Room 01' -Alias ConferenceRoom01 -Room -EnableRoomMailboxAccount $true -MicrosoftOnlineServicesID 'ConferenceRoom01@contoso.com' -RoomMailboxPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String 'P@$$W0rd5959' -AsPlainText -Force)
     ```

   - To modify an existing room mailbox, use the following syntax:

     ``` PowerShell
     Set-Mailbox -Identity <RoomMailboxIdentity> -EnableRoomMailboxAccount $true -RoomMailboxPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String '<Password>' -AsPlainText -Force)
     ```

     This example enables the account for the existing room mailbox that has the alias value ConferenceRoom02, and sets the password to 9898P@$$W0rd.

     ``` PowerShell
     Set-Mailbox -Identity 'ConferenceRoom02' -EnableRoomMailboxAccount $true -RoomMailboxPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String '9898P@$$W0rd' -AsPlainText -Force)
     ```

   For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-Mailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/mailboxes/new-mailbox) and [Set-Mailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/mailboxes/set-mailbox).


3. In Exchange Online PowerShell, configure the following settings on the room mailbox to improve the meeting experience:

   - AutomateProcessing: AutoAccept (The mailbox automatically makes a room reservation decision directly without human intervention.)

   - AddOrganizerToSubject: $false (The meeting organizer is not added to the subject of the meeting request.)

   - DeleteComments: $false (Keep any text in the message body of incoming meeting requests.)

   - DeleteSubject: $false (Keep the subject of incoming meeting requests.)

   - RemovePrivateProperty: $false (Ensures the private flag that was sent by the meeting organizer in the original meeting request remains as specified.)

   - AddAdditionalResponse: $true (The text specified by the AdditionalResponse parameter is added to meeting requests.)

   - AdditionalResponse: "This is a Microsoft Teams meeting room!" (The additional text to add to the meeting request.)

   This example configures these settings on the room mailbox named Project-Rigel-01.

   ``` PowerShell
   Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity 'ConferenceRoom01' -AutomateProcessing AutoAccept -AddOrganizerToSubject $false -DeleteComments $false -DeleteSubject $false -RemovePrivateProperty $false -AddAdditionalResponse $true -AdditionalResponse 'This is a Microsoft Teams meeting room!'
   ```

   For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-CalendarProcessing](/powershell/module/exchange/mailboxes/set-calendarprocessing).
   
4. Connect to MS Online PowerShell set Active Directory values by running the 'Connect-MsolService -Credential $cred' powershell cmdlet. For details about Active Directory, see [Azure ActiveDirectory (MSOnline) 1.0](/powershell/azure/active-directory/overview?view=azureadps-1.0). 

   > [!NOTE]
   > [Azure Active Directory PowerShell 2.0](/powershell/azure/active-directory/overview?view=azureadps-2.0) is not supported. 

5. It is strongly encouraged to disable password expiration on Teams Rooms accounts. Below is an example of how to disable password expiration for the account ConferenceRoom01:

    ``` PowerShell
    Set-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName 'ConferenceRoom01@contoso.com' -PasswordNeverExpires $true
    ```


1. The resource account needs to have a valid Office 365 license in order to connect to Microsoft Teams. You also need to assign a usage location to your device accountâ€”this determines what license SKUs are available for your account. You can use `Get-MsolAccountSku` to retrieve a list of available SKUs for your Office 365 tenant. You can add a license using the `Set-MsolUserLicense` cmdlet.

   This example assigns the Meeting Room license to a user based in the US.

  ``` PowerShell
   Set-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName 'ConferenceRoom01@contoso.com' -UsageLocation 'US'
   Get-MsolAccountSku
   Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName 'ConferenceRoom01@contoso.com' -AddLicenses 'contoso:MEETING_ROOM'
  ``` 


   For detailed instructions, see [Assign licenses to user accounts with Office 365 PowerShell](/office365/enterprise/powershell/assign-licenses-to-user-accounts-with-office-365-powershell#use-the-microsoft-azure-active-directory-module-for-windows-powershell).


## Validate

For validation, you should be able to use any Microsoft Teams client to sign in to the account you created.
