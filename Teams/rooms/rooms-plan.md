# Plan Microsoft Teams Rooms

This article introduces an end-to-end approach to planning, delivering, and operating Microsoft Teams Rooms as part of your overall meeting and conference room strategy.

You’ll find planning information below covering the recommended approach and key decisions that you need to make, with links to supporting technical information. We recommend that you review the Plan, Deploy, and Manage sections even if you’re already fully deployed.

## Overview of Microsoft Teams Rooms

Microsoft Teams Rooms provides a complete meeting experience that brings HD video, audio, and content sharing to meetings of all sizes, from small huddle areas to large conference rooms.

![A console, microphone, and large screen mounted on a conference room wall illustrate the elements of an example Microsoft Teams Rooms setup.](../media/room-systems-image1.png "A console, microphone, and large screen mounted on a conference room wall illustrate the elements of an example Microsoft Teams Rooms setup.")

[Microsoft Teams Rooms help](https://support.office.com/article/Skype-Room-Systems-version-2-help-e667f40e-5aab-40c1-bd68-611fe0002ba2) is a great resource to find out more about Microsoft Teams Rooms and how it can add value as part of your  deployment. In addition, we recommend watching this [overview video](https://youtu.be/tNey5KZVCl0). 

## Microsoft Teams Rooms components

Microsoft Teams Rooms includes the following key components to deliver a great user experience:

- Touchscreen control panel
- Compute
- Microsoft Teams Rooms application
- Dock/extender
- Peripheral devices (camera, microphone, speaker)
- External screens (maximum of two)
- HDMI input

You can procure these components as preinstalled bundles from a number of vendors, or you can purchase the supported components individually by following the [requirements documented in this article](requirements.md).

In addition to the Surface Pro/dock combination, you can also purchase Microsoft Teams Rooms with the touchscreen control panel, compute, dock, and key peripheral devices integrated. 

Typically, the bundles and integrated units include preinstalled software, whereas if you buy supported components individually for the Surface Pro systems, you’ll need to install the software. For instructions, see [this article about installing software on devices](rooms-scale.md). 

You can deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms with Microsoft Teams, Skype for Business Online, or Skype for Business hybrid or on-premises deployments.  See the [Teams Meeting Room Licensing Update](rooms-licensing.md) for information on the needed licenses.

## Identify who will undertake the key activities throughout your deployment

Use the approach illustrated below to guide you through your deployment, and customize the sample outputs provided throughout these articles as needed for your organization.

Begin with understanding what conference rooms you have and envisioning what would work best for you in the future, then move through selecting and procuring the equipment you need, readying your sites, configuring and deploying your service, managing change and user adoption, and developing operations and maintenance procedures.

You might need to coordinate these activities across several teams. We provide a high-level view of the main activities that you should cover, and also suggestions for the teams who are typically involved in deploying and managing conference room systems, to help you decide who you need to work with.

## Room inventory and capability planning

The first step is to inventory your organization’s existing meeting and conference rooms to understand their environment, room size, layout, and purpose, and to identify the capabilities you want each room in scope to have in the future such as which richer collaboration capabilities will be enabled in the room. 

After you create an inventory of the equipment and capabilities in each existing room, your requirements for that room feed into your device selection planning to create a rich conferencing solution. The modalities (audio, video) needed for each room—in addition to room size and purpose—all play an important role in deciding which solution is most appropriate for each room. 

As part of your discovery, it’s key to consider room acoustics and layout. For example, check that the chairs in the room won’t block the camera view. Verify that the room doesn’t have excessive echo or noisy air conditioning, and that it does have sufficient power for the screens and Microsoft Teams Rooms. There are many factors to consider that your audio-visual (AV) team or partner will be able to advise on.

|-----------|---------------|---------------|-----------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| London HQ | Curie         | Medium        | 6&ndash;12                  | Yes          | Speakerphone                        | 1 screen, audio and video plus presentation<br>PSTN Access |

## Device selection 

Evaluate which Microsoft Teams Rooms solution is the most suitable for each room based on the future capabilities you want for the room. Decide which AV peripheral devices are the best fit, depending on room size and layout. 

For guidance for the type of system and peripheral devices by room type and size, see the [Microsoft Teams Rooms requirements](requirements.md) article. 

Based on the vendor you prefer, use the information provided in the requirements article to define your Microsoft Teams Rooms and supported peripheral device configuration per room type, and use this as a template for your deployment. 

**Pro Tip** – Some room types might not be applicable for your deployment.

**Pro Tip –** Now is a great time to start gathering information about the Microsoft Teams Rooms solution you’ve chosen.

## Procurement 

You can procure your chosen system as a bundle or an integrated solution via device partners. You can also acquire a partner device dock and prepare your own Microsoft Teams Rooms solution by using a Surface Pro device and existing, _supported_ AV peripheral devices. 

You can acquire Microsoft Teams Rooms from a number of partners who are listed in the [requirements article](requirements.md). Please visit the partners’ websites to learn more about these solutions and procurement options. 

Depending on your deployment scale and approach, you might decide to have the Microsoft Teams Rooms and supported peripheral devices shipped to a central location for initial configuration and assignment. This might be a good approach for a staged rollout across many sites. Or, you might choose to ship the bundles directly to your sites.

| ![](../media/audio_conferencing_image9.png)<br/>Next steps|<ul><li>Plan for operations.</li><li>Plan for adoption and change management.</li></ul>|

## Plan for operations 

Your organization must execute monitoring, administration, and management tasks on an ongoing basis, and it’s key to agree who will undertake these tasks early in your deployment. 

Many organizations have an AV team or partner who manages their conference rooms and devices. This team should be involved in agreeing who will manage the Microsoft Teams Rooms devices going forward to monitor performance, and deploy software updates and hotfixes. 

Consider which helpdesk queue you’ll route Microsoft Teams Rooms֪–related calls to, and provide an FAQ to the helpdesk team so they can better understand how to use Microsoft Teams Rooms and the key troubleshooting steps they can take. A good starting point for this FAQ is the [user help](https://support.office.com/article/Skype-Room-Systems-version-2-help-e667f40e-5aab-40c1-bd68-611fe0002ba2) and [Known issues](known-issues.md).

## Plan for adoption and change management

Microsoft Teams Rooms systems introduce new capabilities to your users. It’s important that you recognize that this will be a change for your users, and you should ensure your campaign identifies the benefits the new system will have for your users and the key talking points leads can use to discuss with their teams. 

Consider scheduling show-and-tell events and poster drops at each site to inform your users of the new capabilities. You might also create in-room “quick start guides.” Consider finding a meetings champion on each site who can help others get up to speed and start using the devices.
