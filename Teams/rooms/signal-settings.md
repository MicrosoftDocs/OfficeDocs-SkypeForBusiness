# Signal settings

The health of a meeting room is determined by signals that monitor important functions of the device. Your organization can have different preferences or needs for your environment where certain signals are more useful than others, or trigger more often than desired. To help focus on the signals that are important to you, it's possible to enable or disable signals through the **Settings > Signals** page.

On the **Signal settings** page, all signals are listed and can be sorted by **Signal** name, **Device type**, **Category** and **Signal state**. Or they can be filtered by **Device type**, **Category** and **Signal state**.

**To disable signals:**

Disabling a signal turns it off for all applicable devices, closing active tickets of the respective signal and prevent further tickets or remediation.

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams Rooms Pro Management portal, go to **Settings > Signals**.
1. On the **Signal settings** page, select one or more signals from the list.
1. Select **Disable**.

**To enable signals:**

Enabling a signal turns it on for all applicable devices. The signal will be evaluated at the next cycle. Tickets previously closed through disabling can't be reactivated.

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams Rooms Pro Management portal, go to **Settings > Signals**.
1. On the **Signal settings** page, select one or more signals from the list.
1. Select **Enable**.

**To reset signal to default:**

Resetting a signal to default will enable or disable the signal to its default value, as recommended by the Pro service.

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams Rooms Pro Management portal, go to **Settings > Signals**.
1. On the **Signal settings** page, select one or more signals from the list.
1. Select **Reset to default**.
