# Audit logging in the MTR Pro Portal

Audit logs from the MTR Pro Portal let you search for audit records for activities performed by users and admins. This feature is enabled by default. Only the Managed Service Administrator has permission to export and then view the logs.

> [!NOTE]
> Actions performed in the MTR Pro Portal are not logged in Microsoft 365 or Office 365 auditing 

## Exporting logs

When you export all results for an audit log search, the raw data from the unified audit log is copied to a comma-separated value (CSV) file that is downloaded to your local computer. 

**To download logs** 

1. Go to **Settings > General > Audit Logs**.
1. To define the date range for logs of interest, enter the **Start date** and **End date.**

   > [!NOTE]
   > Logs are only available for up to 180 days.

1. Select **Download logs.**

   ![Audit log date range](../media/multi-tenant-auditing.png)

   A message displayed at the bottom of the window prompts you to open or save the CSV file. 

1. Select **Save** > **Save as**, and save the CSV file to your local computer. 

1. It takes a while to download many search results when searching for all activities, or on a broad date range. When the CSV file is finished downloading, a message at the bottom of the window is displayed.
