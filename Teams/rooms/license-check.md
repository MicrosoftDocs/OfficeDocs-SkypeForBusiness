# Find Teams Rooms devices with unsupported licenses

Resource accounts that only have user licenses or Microsoft Teams Shared Device licenses assigned to them aren't supported for use with Microsoft Teams Rooms devices. Resource accounts used with Teams Rooms devices need to be assigned one of the following licenses:

- Microsoft Teams Rooms Pro
- Microsoft Teams Rooms Basic
- Microsoft Teams Rooms Standard (legacy)
- Microsoft Teams Rooms Premium (legacy)

[!INCLUDE [mtr-user-licensing](../includes/mtr-user-licensing.md)]

You have a couple of options for checking whether the resource accounts signed into your Teams Rooms devices have a Teams Rooms license. If you only have a couple Teams Rooms devices, use the steps in [Check the license of a few Teams Rooms devices](#check-the-license-of-a-couple-teams-rooms-devices). If you have more than a few Teams Rooms devices, use the steps in [Check the license of multiple Microsoft Teams Rooms devices](#check-the-license-of-multiple-microsoft-teams-rooms-devices).

For information about Teams Rooms licensing, see [Microsoft Teams Rooms licenses](rooms-licensing.md).

## Check the license of a couple Teams Rooms devices

For a small number of devices, you can see what license your devices have by going to Teams devices in the Teams admin center, and then selecting the device category (**Teams Rooms on Windows**, **Teams Rooms on Android**, or **Surface Hubs**) you want to see.

For example, if you select **Teams devices > Teams Rooms on Windows**, you'll see the following image. The **License** column shows the Teams Rooms license assigned to each device.

Devices that have the Teams Rooms Pro license can access all the capabilities of their Teams Rooms devices. Devices with other Teams Rooms licenses can access a subset of those features. You can see which features are available to each license in [Teams Rooms Basic and Teams Rooms Pro feature comparison](rooms-licensing.md#teams-rooms-basic-and-teams-rooms-pro-feature-comparison).

## Check the license of multiple Microsoft Teams Rooms devices

Checking licenses for Teams Rooms devices one at a time can be time consuming. To make this process easier, we're making available a sample script that checks the licenses of all your Teams Rooms devices. The script provides you with a list of the resource accounts that are associated with your Teams Rooms devices, organized by license type. Resource accounts with licenses that aren't supported with Teams Rooms devices are grouped together for your review. If resource accounts associated with Teams Rooms devices have an unsupported license type, you'll need to change it to a supported license before July 1, 2023.

Take a look at this short video to see how to use the example script to audit your licenses:

## See which features require a Microsoft Teams Rooms Pro license

Features that require a Microsoft Teams Rooms Pro license can be identified by looking for the icon on a device's details page. If the device that's currently selected isn't assigned a Microsoft Teams Rooms Pro license, you can't perform the action and a prompt to upgrade is displayed.
