# Deploy :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: monitoring with :::no-loc text="Azure Monitor":::

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is being deprecated and being replaced by functionality found in the Teams admin center and Teams Rooms Pro Management portal. See [Overview of the Teams Rooms Pro Management portal](../rooms/rooms-pro-management.md) for more information.

This article discusses how to set up and deploy integrated, end-to-end monitoring of :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: devices by using :::no-loc text="Azure Monitor":::.

[!INCLUDE [teams-pro-license-requirement](../includes/teams-pro-license-requirement.md)]

You can configure :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: within :::no-loc text="Azure Monitor"::: to provide basic telemetry and alerts that will help you manage :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms":::. As your management solution matures, you might decide to deploy additional data and management capabilities to create a more detailed view of device availability and performance.

By following this guide, you can use a dashboard like the following example to get detailed status reporting for device availability, application and hardware health, and :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: application and operating system version distribution.

:::image type="content" alt-text="Screenshot of sample Log Analytics view for Microsoft Teams Rooms." source="../media/Deploy-Azure-Monitor-1.png" lightbox="../media/Deploy-Azure-Monitor-1.png":::

At a high level, you need to perform the following tasks:


1. [Validate :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: configuration](azure-monitor-deploy.md#validate_LogAnalytics)
2. [Configure test devices for :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: management setup](azure-monitor-deploy.md#configure_test_devices)
3. [Map custom fields](azure-monitor-deploy.md#Custom_fields)
4. [Define the :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: views in :::no-loc text="Log Analytics":::](azure-monitor-deploy.md#Define_Views)
5. [Define alerts](azure-monitor-deploy.md#Alerts)
6. [Configure all devices for Monitoring](azure-monitor-deploy.md#configure_all_devices)
7. [Configure additional :::no-loc text="Azure Monitor"::: solutions](azure-monitor-deploy.md#Solutions)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although with minimal configuration, :::no-loc text="Azure Monitor"::: :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: can monitor a computer running a :::no-loc text="Windows"::: operating system, there are still some :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms":::–specific steps that you need to take before you start deploying agents to all :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: devices.
> Therefore, we highly recommend you perform all configuration steps in the right order for a controlled setup and configuration. The quality of the end result very much depends on the quality of the initial configuration.

## Validate :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: configuration
<a name="validate_LogAnalytics"> </a>

You need to have a :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: workspace to start collecting logs from :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms":::. A workspace is a unique :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: environment with its own data repository, data sources, and solutions. If you already have an existing :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: workspace, you might use it to monitor your :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: deployment or alternatively, you can create a dedicated :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: workspace specific to your :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: monitoring needs.

If you need to create a new :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: workspace, follow the instructions in the article [Create a :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: workspace in the :::no-loc text="Azure"::: portal](/azure/azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace)

> [!NOTE]
> To use :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: with :::no-loc text="Azure Monitor":::, you need to have an active :::no-loc text="Azure"::: subscription. If you don't have an :::no-loc text="Azure"::: subscription, you can create [a free trial subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) as a starting point.

### Configure :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: to collect :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: event logs

:::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: only collects events from the :::no-loc text="Windows"::: event logs that are specified in the settings. For each log, only the events with the selected severities are collected.

You need to configure :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: to collect the logs required to monitor :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: device and application status. :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: use the **:::no-loc text="Skype Room System":::** event log.

To configure :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: to collect the :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: events, see [:::no-loc text="Windows"::: event log data sources in :::no-loc text="Azure Monitor":::](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-sources-windows-events)

:::image type="content" alt-text="Screenshot of event log settings." source="../media/Deploy-Azure-Monitor-2.png" lightbox="../media/Deploy-Azure-Monitor-2.png":::

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Configure :::no-loc text="Windows"::: Event Log settings and enter **:::no-loc text="Skype Room System":::** as event log name, and then select the **Error**, **Warning**, and **Information** check boxes.

## Configure test devices for Azure Monitoring
<a name="configure_test_devices"> </a>

You need to prepare :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: to be able to monitor :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms":::–related events. To start with, you need to deploy :::no-loc text="Microsoft Monitoring"::: agents to one or two :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: devices that you have physical access to, and get those test devices to generate some data and push it to the :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: workspace.

### Install :::no-loc text="Microsoft Monitoring"::: agents to test devices

Deploy the :::no-loc text="Microsoft Monitoring"::: agent to the test devices by using the instructions provided in [Connect :::no-loc text="Windows"::: computers to the :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: service in :::no-loc text="Azure":::](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/agent-windows). This article provides detailed information about the steps for deploying :::no-loc text="Microsoft Monitoring"::: Agent for :::no-loc text="Windows":::, instructions for obtaining the :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: ***Workspace ID*** and the ***primary key*** to get :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: devices connected to your :::no-loc text="Azure Monitor"::: deployment, and steps to verify agent connectivity to :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: instance.

### Generate sample :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: events

After the :::no-loc text="Microsoft Monitoring"::: agent is deployed onto the test devices, verify that the required event log data is collected by :::no-loc text="Azure Monitor":::.

> [!NOTE]
> Reboot the device after the installation of the :::no-loc text="Microsoft Monitoring"::: agent, and make sure that :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: Meeting app is started, so that it can generate new events into the Event Log.

1.  Sign in to the [:::no-loc text="Microsoft Azure"::: portal](https://portal.azure.com) and go to :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: and select your workspace.

2.  List the heartbeat events generated by a :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: device:
    1.  Select your workspace and go to **Logs** and use a query to retrieve the heartbeat records that will have the custom fields for :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms":::.
    2.  Sample query: `Event | where Source == "SRS-App" and EventID == 2000`

3.  Make sure that the query returns log records that include events generated by the :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: meetings app.

4.  Generate a hardware issue, and validate that the required events are logged in :::no-loc text="Azure Log Analytics":::.
    1.  Unplug one of the peripheral devices on the test :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: system. This could be the camera, speaker, microphone, or Front Room Display
    2.  Wait 10 minutes for the event log to be populated in :::no-loc text="Azure Log Analytics":::.
    3.  Use a query to list hardware error events: `Event | where Source == "SRS-App" and EventID == 3001`

5.  Generate an application issue, and validate that the required events are logged.
    1.  Modify :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: account configuration, and type an incorrect Email/password pair.
    2.  Wait 10 minutes for the event log to be populated in :::no-loc text="Azure Log Analytics":::.
    3.  Use a query to list application error events: `Event | where Source == "SRS-App" and EventID == 2001 and EventLevel == 1`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These sample event logs are required before custom fields can be configured. Don't proceed to the next step until you have collected the required event logs.

## Map custom fields
<a name="Custom_fields"> </a>

You use custom fields to extract specific data from the event logs. You need to define custom fields that will be used later with your tiles, dashboard views, and alerts. See [Custom fields in :::no-loc text="Log Analytics":::](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/custom-fields) and become familiar with the concepts before you start creating your custom fields.

To extract your custom fields out of the captured event logs, follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to the [:::no-loc text="Microsoft Azure"::: portal](https://portal.azure.com) and go to :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: and select your workspace.

2. List the events generated by a :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: device:
   1.  Go to **Logs** and use a query to retrieve the records that will have the custom field.
   2.  Sample query: `Event | where Source == "SRS-App" and EventID == 2000`

3. Select one of the records, select the button to the left, and start the field extraction wizard.
4. Highlight the data you'd like to extract from the RenderedDescription and provide a Field Title. The field names that you should use are provided in Table 1.
5. Use the mappings shown in *Table 1*. :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: will automatically append the **\_CF** string when you define the new field.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember that all JSON and :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: fields are case-sensitive.
> 
> Pay attention to the queries required for each custom field in the table below. You need to use the correct queries for :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: to successfully extract custom field values.
> 
**Table 1**

## Define the :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: views in :::no-loc text="Log Analytics":::
<a name="Define_Views"> </a>

After data is collected and custom fields are mapped, you can use View Designer to develop a dashboard containing various tiles to monitor :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: events. Use View Designer to create the following tiles. For more information, see [Create custom views by using View Designer in :::no-loc text="Log Analytics":::](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/view-designer)

> [!NOTE]
> Previous steps in this guide should have been completed for the dashboard tiles to work properly.

## Configure Alerts in :::no-loc text="Azure Monitor":::
<a name="Alerts"> </a>

:::no-loc text="Azure Monitor"::: can raise alerts to notify the administrators, when a :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: console encounters an issue.

:::no-loc text="Azure Monitor"::: includes a built-in alerting mechanism that runs through scheduled log searches at regular intervals. If the results of the log search match some particular criteria, an alert record is created.

The rule can then automatically run one or more actions to proactively notify you of the alert or invoke another process. The possible options with alerts are:
-   Sending an email
-   Invoking an external process through an HTTP POST request
-   Starting a runbook in :::no-loc text="Azure Automation"::: service

See [Log alerts in :::no-loc text="Azure Monitor":::](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-unified-log) to learn more about the alerts in :::no-loc text="Azure Monitor":::.

> [!NOTE]
> The following examples send email alerts when a :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: device generates a hardware or an application error.

### Configure an email alert for :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: hardware issues

Configure an alert rule that checks for :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: devices that have encountered hardware issues within the last hour.
1.  Sign in to the [:::no-loc text="Microsoft Azure"::: portal](https://portal.azure.com) and go to :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: and select your workspace.

2. Navigate to your :::no-loc text="Log Analytics"::: workspace and select **Alerts** and then select **New alert rule**

3. Select **Add condition** and then **Custom log search**

4.  Enter the following query to the Search query text box.

    ```kusto
    Event
    | where EventLog == "Skype Room System" and EventLevelName == "Error" and EventID == "3001" and TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
    | summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by Computer
    | project TimeGenerated, Computer, SRSAlias_CF, SRSAppVersion_CF, SRSOSVersion_CF, SRSOSLongVersion_CF, SRSIPv4Address_CF, SRSIPv6Address_CF, SRSOperationName_CF, SRSOperationResult_CF, SRSResourceState_CF, SRSConfMicrophoneStatus_CF, SRSConfSpeakerStatus_CF, SRSDefaultSpeakerStatus_CF, SRSCameraStatus_CF, SRSFORDStatus_CF, SRSMotionSensorStatus_CF, SRSHDMIIngestStatus_CF, SRSEventDescription_CF
    |sort by TimeGenerated desc
    ```

5.  Configure the Alert logic settings:<br>
    **Based on:** Number of results<br>
    **Condition:** Greater than<br>
    **Threshold:** 0<br>

6. Configure Evaluation settings and select **Done**: <br>
    **Period (in minutes):** 60<br>
    **Frequency (in minutes):** 60<br>

7. Configure action groups:
    1.  Select **Create New**
    2.  Provide suitable names for the *Action group name* and *Short Name* fields.
    3.  Specify a unique *Action Name* and select **Email/SMS/Push/Voice**, and then select **Edit details**.
    4.  Select the **Email** checkbox and provide the email address of the person or group that will receive the alerts.
    5.  You may also provide your phone number to get notified with SMS, a voice call or both.
    6. Select **OK**.

8. **Customize Actions** if you like to override the subject line of the alert emails.

9. Specify a rule name and description.<br>
    **Rule Name:** :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: Hardware Failure Alert<br>
    **Description:** List of devices that encountered a hardware issue within the last hour<br>

10. Select the intended severity and make sure the rule is enabled.

11. Select **Create alert rule**.

### Configure an email alert for :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: application issues

Repeat the same procedure but use the following query to list devices that have encountered application issues within the last hour.

```kusto
Event
| where EventLog == "Skype Room System" and EventLevelName == "Error" and EventID == "2001" and TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by Computer
| project TimeGenerated, Computer, SRSAlias_CF, SRSAppVersion_CF, SRSOSVersion_CF, SRSOSLongVersion_CF, SRSIPv4Address_CF, SRSIPv6Address_CF, SRSOperationName_CF, SRSOperationResult_CF, SRSResourceState_CF, SRSEventDescription_CF
| sort by TimeGenerated desc
```

Now you've completed defining alerts. You can define additional alerts by using the examples above.

When an alert is generated, you'll get an email that lists the devices that encountered an issue within the last hour.

![Sample :::no-loc text="Azure Monitor"::: alert email](../media/Deploy-Azure-Monitor-6.png "Sample :::no-loc text="Azure Monitor"::: alert email")

## Configure all devices for :::no-loc text="Azure Monitoring":::
<a name="configure_all_devices"> </a>
After the dashboards and alerts are configured, you can set up and configure :::no-loc text="Microsoft Monitoring"::: agent on all :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: devices to complete your monitoring deployment.

Although you can install and configure the :::no-loc text="Microsoft Monitoring"::: agent manually on each device, we highly recommend you leverage existing software deployment tools and methods.

If you're building your :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: devices for the first time, you might want to include the :::no-loc text="Microsoft Monitoring"::: agent setup and configuration steps as part of your build process. For more information, see [Install the agent using the command line](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/agent-windows#install-the-agent-using-the-command-line).

### Deploying :::no-loc text="Microsoft Monitoring"::: agent by using a Group Policy Object (GPO)

If you already deployed your :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: devices before you implement :::no-loc text="Azure Monitoring":::, you can use the provided script to set up and configure the agents by using :::no-loc text="Active Directory"::: group policy objects.

1.  Create a shared network path and grant read access to **Domain Computers** group.

2.  Download the 64-bit version of the :::no-loc text="Microsoft Monitoring"::: Agent for :::no-loc text="Windows"::: from <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=517476>

3.  Extract the contents of the setup package into the network share.
    1.  Open a Command Prompt window, and then execute **MMASetup-AMD64.exe /c**
    2.  Specify the share you just created, and extract the content.

4.  Create a new Group Policy Object and assign it to the organizational unit where :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: machine accounts are located.

5.  Configure PowerShell execution policy:
    1.  Edit the newly created Group Policy Object and navigate to Computer Configuration \\ Policies \\ Administrative Templates \\ :::no-loc text="Windows"::: Components \\ :::no-loc text="Windows PowerShell":::
    2.  Enable the **Turn on Script Execution** and set **Execution Policy** to **Allow Local Scripts**.

6.  Configure the startup script:
    1.  Copy the following script and save it as Install-MMAgent.ps1.
    2.  Modify WorkspaceId, WorkspaceKey, and SetupPath parameters to match your configuration.
    3.  Edit the same Group Policy Object and navigate to Computer Configuration \\ Policies \\ :::no-loc text="Windows"::: Settings \\ Scripts (Startup/Shutdown)
    4.  Double-click to select **Startup**, and then select **PowerShell Scripts**.
    5.  Select **Show Files**, and then copy the **Install-MMAgent.ps1** file to that folder.
    6.  Select **Add**, and then **Browse**.
    7.  Select the ps1 script you just copied.

7.  :::no-loc text="Microsoft Teams Rooms"::: should install and configure the :::no-loc text="Microsoft Monitoring"::: agent with the second reboot.

```PowerShell
# Install-MMAgent.ps1
<#
Date:        04/20/2018
Script:      Install-MMAgent.ps1
Version:     1.0
#>

# Set the parameters
$WorkspaceId = "<your workspace id>"
$WorkspaceKey = "<your workspace key>"
$SetupPath = "\\Server\Share"

$SetupParameters = "/qn NOAPM=1 ADD_OPINSIGHTS_WORKSPACE=1 OPINSIGHTS_WORKSPACE_AZURE_CLOUD_TYPE=0 OPINSIGHTS_WORKSPACE_ID=$WorkspaceId OPINSIGHTS_WORKSPACE_KEY=$WorkspaceKey AcceptEndUserLicenseAgreement=1"

# $SetupParameters = $SetupParameters + " OPINSIGHTS_PROXY_URL=<Proxy server URL> OPINSIGHTS_PROXY_USERNAME=<Proxy server username> OPINSIGHTS_PROXY_PASSWORD=<Proxy server password>"

# Start PowerShell logging
Start-Transcript -Path C:\Temp\MMA-Install.Log

# Check if the Microsoft Monitoring Agent is installed
$mma = New-Object -ComObject 'AgentConfigManager.MgmtSvcCfg'

# Check if the Microsoft Monitoring agent is installed
if (!$mma)
{
    #Install agent
    Start-Process -FilePath "$SetupPath\Setup.exe" -ArgumentList $SetupParameters -ErrorAction Stop -Wait
}

# Check if the agent has a valid configuration
$CheckMMA = $mma.GetCloudWorkspace($WorkspaceId).AgentId
if (!$CheckMMA)
{
    # Apply new configuration
    $mma.AddCloudWorkspace($WorkspaceId, $WorkspaceKey)
    $mma.ReloadConfiguration()
}

Stop-Transcript
```
