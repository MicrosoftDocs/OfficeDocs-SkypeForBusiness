# Microsoft Teams Rooms

Transform meeting spaces ranging from small huddle areas to large conference rooms with a rich, collaborative Teams experience that's simple to use, deploy, and manage.

Start meetings on time with one-touch join, then instantly project to the display in the room and share to remote participants.

Select the right system and audio video peripherals from one of our partners: Yealink, Logitech, Crestron, Polycom, Lenovo, and HP.
