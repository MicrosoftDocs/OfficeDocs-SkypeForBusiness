# Health and usage reports

The reporting node contains data for the health and usage of your Microsoft Teams Rooms in the Pro Management portal. The **Overview** tab surfaces tenant-wide health trends of your rooms. The **Health** tab displays a list of rooms with their corresponding health data. Room usage based on calendar information and call quality data is visible under the **Usage** tab.

## Export tickets

The ticket export feature lets you export all active and closed ticket history information within a select date range. Exporting tickets lets you easily access and analyze your ticket history data for better decision making.  

Under the **Overview** report, the **Export tickets** button provides ticket history details that include the following fields: creation date, device name, incident type, ticket state, ticket, last update, history, last resolved date, message/notes conversations, closure summary, closed by, and last closed date. 

The data is generated in a JSON file that you can download and import into Power BI. The download starts after you select **Export tickets**. If you leave the portal before the download starts, you'll have to request the file again.

<!--### Ticket history

The ticket history graph shows a comparison of incidents assigned to you or Microsoft over the specified time period.

> [!NOTE]
> If a ticket changes owner in a day, whoever owns the assignment for the majority of that day will have the ticket counted towards them. For example, if you assign the ticket to Microsoft early in the day, the ticket counts towards **Assigned to Microsoft** for the day.

### Health history

This graph shows the average health (definition in Health section) for all the rooms in the tenant and the average health for all MTR Pro customers on a day-to-day basis. You can view the average health for up to 90 days.

<!--!![A screenshot of rooms health and average health](../media/health-and-usage-010.png)-->

### Most reliable/least reliable rooms

Two tables show the most reliable and least reliable rooms based on health. For the full list view, select Health, then sort the list by the Health column.

### Rooms history

Provides a historical view of rooms enrolled in the service and provides a comparative view of rooms that were healthy or unmonitored in the same time period.

## Health

To navigate to the Health report for all rooms, select Reports, then select  **Health**.

<!--!![A screenshot of a Reports health percentage](../media/health-and-usage-001.png)-->

The health score is a metric designed to surface rooms that are most likely to cause end-user frustration. A room can either be healthy or unhealthy for a given day. It is considered unhealthy if a ticket or many tickets impacted the room for more than 20 total minutes during non-maintenance hours (5AM -9PM machine local time). For example, if a ticket is opened at 5:00 AM but closed at 5:15 AM, the room is still considered healthy. But, if a second ticket occurred from 09:00AM to 9:10AM, the room would be considered unhealthy for the day. Similarly, if a ticket occurred from 5:00 AM to 5:21 AM, it is considered unhealthy for the day.

> [!NOTE]
> Health for the day is aggregated once a day at 12:00 AM UTC time. For customers near the international date line, health aggregation may occur near the middle of the workday.

> [!NOTE]
> Rooms that are onboarding are hidden for the list of rooms in the Health tab and do not count towards the average health of the tenant.

Clicking on a room listed in this view displays more details.

The bar graph displays the number of tickets on each day. Tickets opened on that respective day appear in blue. Tickets opened prior to the respective day appear in orange. Clicking on a day on the graph filters the pie chart and table to the relevant tickets. To reverse the filter, navigate with the breadcrumbs or click on the graph.

Categorization of tickets is represented in the donut chart. Interacting with this filters the timeline graph and table. To reverse the filter, navigate with the breadcrumbs or click on the graph.

The meeting impact view shows scheduled meetings during which a ticket with a severity of "Important" or "Critical" was open. The purpose of this view is to provide an approximation of meetings where participants could have experienced issues.

The Settings tab displays the metadata of the room such as the hardware information, device settings, BIOS information, app settings and location.

## Usage

To view the Usage report for all rooms, select **Reports->Usage**.

<!--!![A screenshot of all rooms' usage by health](../media/health-and-usage-011.png)-->

The headlines provide a few insights:

- Total rooms in your tenant
- How many do not have any booked meetings, either offline or online
- Percentage of utilization of rooms across the tenant
- Total number of booked meetings through exchange
- Percentage of booked meetings that included a Skype or Teams link
- Total calls with room participation
- Aggregate call performance score from all calls classified with "Good" quality to all calls. 

Below the headline **Metrics** is a table of rooms with corresponding metrics. Select a room to view more usage details. The metrics in the table are described in the following table.

|Column|Description|
|---|---|
|Utilization|Percentage of time the room was booked during business hours in the selected period. Ex. Time period set to 7 days. 80% utilization over the means the room was booked for 32/40 hours|
|Booked online|Of the booked meetings, the percentage of which were enabled with Teams. Ex. 10 meetings were booked. Of that, 8 had a Teams link. Booked Online = 80%|
|Scheduled meetings|Absolute number of meetings scheduled in the room|
|Total calls|Absolute number of calls with the room as a participant.|
Call performance|Percentage of calls with a "Good" rating. Each call is evaluated and receives a Good, Poor, Unknown rating. This metric is calculated from Good calls/Total calls|

Usage is calculated at the end of each day at midnight (00:00) local time of the meeting room device. Utilization is calculated based on the total booked meeting time for that day divided by 8 hours.

## Usage details of a room

Clicking on a room in the list view prompts a flyout with more in-depth information. Under the Utilization tab of the flyout is a graph showing hours of usage of the last five business days. For each day there are two bars: blue represents booked meeting time; purple represents scheduled time of Teams/Skype enabled meetings. At the bottom, the average meeting bookings and duration for the past five business days are calculated.

<!--![A screenshot of utilization by hours per day](../media/health-and-usage-012.png)-->

The **Calls** table shows meetings in which the room participated in a Teams call. The Room Audio Quality is evaluated for only the room, not all participants. To view call quality for all participants of a specific call, select a call by clicking on the Start Time.

<!--!![A screenshot of room audio quality](../media/health-and-usage-016.png)-->
