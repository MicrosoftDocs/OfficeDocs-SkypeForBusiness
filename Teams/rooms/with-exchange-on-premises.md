# Deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms with Exchange on premises (Hybrid)

Read this topic for information on how to deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms in a hybrid environment with Exchange on-premises and Microsoft Teams.
  
If your organization has a mix of services, with some hosted on-premises and some hosted online, then your configuration will depend on where each service is hosted. This topic covers hybrid deployments for Microsoft Teams Rooms with Exchange hosted on-premises. Because there are so many different variations in this type of deployment, it's not possible to provide detailed instructions for all of them. The following process will work for many configurations. If the process isn't right for your setup, we recommend that you use Windows PowerShell to achieve the same end result as documented here, and for other deployment options.
  
## Requirements

Before you deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms with Exchange on premises, be sure you have met the requirements. For more information, see [Microsoft Teams Rooms requirements](requirements.md).

### Enable the remote mailbox and set properties

1. [Open the Exchange Management Shell](/powershell/exchange/exchange-server/open-the-exchange-management-shell) or [connect to your Exchange server using remote PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/exchange-server/connect-to-exchange-servers-using-remote-powershell).

2. In Exchange PowerShell, create a new room mailbox or modify an existing room mailbox. By default, room mailboxes don't have associated accounts, so you'll need to add an account when you create or modify a room mailbox that allows it to authenticate with Microsoft Teams.

   - To create a new room mailbox, use the following syntax:

     ``` PowerShell
     New-Mailbox -UserPrincipalName <UPN> -Name <String> -Alias <String> -Room -EnableRoomMailboxAccount $true -RoomMailboxPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String '<Password>' -AsPlainText -Force)
     ```
     
     This example creates a new room mailbox with the following settings:

     - Account: ConferenceRoom01@contoso.com
  
     - Name: ConferenceRoom01

     - Alias: ConferenceRoom01

     - Account password: P@$$W0rd5959

     ``` PowerShell
     New-Mailbox -UserPrincipalName ConferenceRoom01@contoso.com -Name "ConferenceRoom01" -Alias ConferenceRoom01 -Room -EnableRoomMailboxAccount $true -RoomMailboxPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String 'P@$$W0rd5959' -AsPlainText -Force)
     ```

   - To modify an existing room mailbox, use the following syntax:

     ``` PowerShell
     Set-Mailbox -Identity <RoomMailboxIdentity> -EnableRoomMailboxAccount $true -RoomMailboxPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String '<Password>' -AsPlainText -Force)
     ```

     This example enables the account for the existing room mailbox that has the alias value ConferenceRoom02, and sets the password to 9898P@$$W0rd. Note that the account will be ConferenceRoom02@contoso.com because of the existing alias value.

     ``` PowerShell
     Set-Mailbox -Identity ConferenceRoom02 -EnableRoomMailboxAccount $true -RoomMailboxPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String '9898P@$$W0rd' -AsPlainText -Force)
     ```

   For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-Mailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/mailboxes/new-mailbox) and [Set-Mailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/mailboxes/set-mailbox).

3. In Exchange PowerShell, configure the following settings on the room mailbox to improve the meeting experience:

   - AutomateProcessing: AutoAccept (Meeting organizers receive the room reservation decisions directly without human intervention.)

   - AddOrganizerToSubject: $false (The meeting organizer is not added to the subject of the meeting request.)

   - DeleteComments: $false (Keep any text in the message body of incoming meeting requests.)

   - DeleteSubject: $false (Keep the subject of incoming meeting requests.)

   - RemovePrivateProperty: $false (Ensures the private flag that was sent by the meeting organizer in the original meeting request remains as specified.)

   - AddAdditionalResponse: $true (The text specified by the AdditionalResponse parameter is added to meeting requests.)

   - AdditionalResponse: "This is a Microsoft Teams Meeting room!" (The additional text to add to the meeting request.)

   This example configures these settings on the room mailbox named ConferenceRoom01.

   ```PowerShell
   Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity "ConferenceRoom01" -AutomateProcessing AutoAccept -AddOrganizerToSubject $false -DeleteComments $false -DeleteSubject $false -RemovePrivateProperty $false -AddAdditionalResponse $true -AdditionalResponse "This is a Microsoft Teams Meeting room!"
   ```

   For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-CalendarProcessing](/powershell/module/exchange/mailboxes/set-calendarprocessing).

### Set password to never expire

1. In the **Active Directory Users and Computers** tool, find the Microsoft Teams Rooms account, right-click it and select **Properties**.

2. Select the **Password never expires** checkbox and then click **OK**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Selecting **Password never expires** is a requirement for Microsoft Teams Rooms. Your domain rules may prohibit passwords that don't expire. If so, you'll need to create an exception for each Microsoft Teams Rooms account.

### Assign a Microsoft 365 or Office 365 license

1. Connect to Azure Active Directory. For details about Azure Active Directory, see [Azure ActiveDirectory (MSOnline) 1.0](/powershell/azure/active-directory/overview?view=azureadps-1.0). 

   > [!NOTE]
   > [Azure Active Directory PowerShell 2.0](/powershell/azure/active-directory/overview?view=azureadps-2.0) is not supported. 

2. The resource account needs to have a valid Microsoft 365 or Office 365 license, or Exchange and Microsoft Teams will not work. If you have the license, you need to assign a usage location to your resource accountâ€”this determines what license SKUs are available for your account. You can use `Get-MsolAccountSku` <!-- Get-AzureADSubscribedSku --> to retrieve a list of available SKUs.

   ```Powershell
   Get-MsolAccountSku
   ```

   <!--
   ```Powershell
   Get-AzureADSubscribedSku | Select -Property Sku*,ConsumedUnits -ExpandProperty PrepaidUnits
   ```  -->

3. Next, you can add a license using the `Set-MsolUserLicense` <!--Set-AzureADUserLicense --> cmdlet. This example adds the Meeting Room license to the account:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName "ConferenceRoom01@contoso.com" -UsageLocation "US"
   Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName "ConferenceRoom01@contoso.com" -AddLicenses "Contoso:MEETING_ROOM"
   ```

   <!-- 
   ```Powershell
   Set-AzureADUser -UserPrincipalName "Rigel1@contoso.onmicrosoft.com" -UsageLocation "US"
   Set-AzureADUserLicense -UserPrincipalName "Rigel1@contoso.onmicrosoft.com" -AddLicenses "Contoso:MEETING_ROOM"
   ```   -->

   For detailed instructions, see [Assign licenses to user accounts with Office 365 PowerShell](/office365/enterprise/powershell/assign-licenses-to-user-accounts-with-office-365-powershell#use-the-microsoft-azure-active-directory-module-for-windows-powershell).

For validation, you should be able to use any client to log in to this account.
