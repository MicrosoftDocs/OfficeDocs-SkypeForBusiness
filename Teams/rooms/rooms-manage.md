# Manage Microsoft Teams Rooms

If you have Microsoft Teams Rooms in your organization, you have flexible management options.  You can manage the devices yourself in the same central location where you manage all you Teams solutions, Microsoft Teams admin center. Alternately, you can transfer management responsibility to dedicated experts using [Microsoft Teams Rooms Managed Services](https://portal.rooms.microsoft.com).  You can also delegate management access to a partner of your choice for either of the options.

With Microsoft Teams admin center, you can:

- Perform device management like restarting devices and downloading device logs
- Apply Teams-specific settings
- Check the health status of Microsoft Teams Rooms and their peripherals, including cameras, displays, microphones, and so on
- Review current and past meeting activity (such as details about call quality, network health and connectivity, and number of participants)
- See peripherals (such as cameras and projectors) connected to Microsoft Teams Rooms

To manage Teams Rooms devices, open the [Microsoft Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com) and go to **Teams Devices** > **Teams Rooms on Windows**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To manage devices using the Teams admin center, you need to be assigned the Global Administrator, Teams Administrator, or Teams Devices Administrator roles.

## Make changes to Teams Rooms devices

If you have more than one Teams Rooms, you can do most actions on multiple devices at the same time. For example, you can set Teams app settings on all of your Teams Rooms at the same time.

### Device settings

You can change settings on one or more Teams Rooms in your organization. To change settings, select the device or devices you want to manage and then select **Edit Settings**. A new pane will open with all of the settings you can change. The following table lists the settings you can change using the Teams admin center. Some settings are only available when you select a single Teams Rooms.

If you select more than one, settings that support bulk editing show the two following options.

- **Keep existing value** If you choose this option, no changes will be made to the setting on the Teams Rooms you selected.
- **Replace existing value with** If you choose this option, you can update the setting on the Teams Rooms you selected with the value you provide.
    > [!CAUTION]
    > Existing values on the settings you choose to update will be replaced with the value you provide. If you want to add to a list of existing values, you need to include the existing values with the value you want to add. For example, if a setting has an existing domain list of `contoso.com, fabrikam.com`, and you want to add `northwindtraders.com`, the value you need to provide would be `contoso.com, fabrikam.com, northwindtraders.com`.
    >
    > If you select multiple Teams Rooms, the setting on all of the devices you select will be changed to the value you provide. If Teams Rooms have different values for a setting, they'll all be updated to the same value.

### Cortana settings

You can enable Cortana for _Voice Activation_ or _Push to talk_ using PowerShell for all devices in your organization, or for each device separately.

See [Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows](../cortana-in-teams.md) in the "Cortana voice assistance in Teams" article.

### Front row layout settings

Front row is meeting view layout option for Teams Rooms on Windows.

| Teams device | App version | Front of room display |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------------|
|Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows | 4.11.12.0 or higher (The latest version is recommended) | Supports single and dual displays; Minimum size: 46 inches; Aspect ratio 16:9 with 1920x1080 resolution or 21:9 with 2560x1080 resolution; All displays should be set at 100% scaling in Windows settings |

See [Microsoft Teams Rooms maintenance and operations](rooms-operations.md#scale-and-resolution), to adjust your display settings to meet Front row's requirements.

To learn how to set Front row as the default layout for a room, or how to turn it off, see [Manage a Microsoft Teams Rooms console settings remotely with an XML configuration file](xml-config-file.md#set-front-row-as-the-default-layout).

See [Known issues](known-issues.md#Limits) for more information on managing Front row.

## Device restart options

Changes to device settings will only take effect after Teams Rooms has been restarted. When you make changes that need a restart, you can choose whether to restart immediately or schedule a restart. Here are the available restart options:

- **Immediate restart** If you choose this option, all of the devices you're making changes to will restart as soon as you select this option.
- **Scheduled restart** If you choose this option, you can restart the devices you're making changes to at a time that's less disruptive to your organization.
  - **Select date and time** - Choose the specific date and time to restart the device. The date and time you choose is local to the device being restarted. 
  - **Leave update for nightly reboot** Devices are restarted nightly to perform maintenance. Changes you make to devices will be applied during this restart.

> [!CAUTION]
> Teams Rooms that are in use at the time of a restart will become unavailable for the duration of the restart process. They'll be disconnected from in-progress meetings and won't be available to join new meetings.

## Remove device

When you remove a device, the device is removed from your organization and no longer appears in your list of Teams Rooms on Windows in the Teams admin center.

If you remove a device and it's still configured with a valid username and password, it will be automatically re-added to your Teams Rooms list if it connects to Microsoft 365 again.

To remove one or more devices, do the following:

1. Go to **Teams Devices** > **Teams Rooms on Windows** and select the devices you want to remove.
2. Select **Remove**.

## Download device logs

You can download a copy of a device's diagnostic log files if requested to do so by Microsoft support. Log files are compressed into a zip file that can be downloaded from the Teams admin center.

To download logs from a Teams Rooms device to your computer, do the following:

1. Go to **Teams Devices** > **Teams Rooms on Windows** and select the name of the device you want to download logs from.
1. Select **Download device logs**. It can take several minutes for device logs to become available.
1. Select the **History** tab and then select log file link under **Diagnostics file**. A zip file containing your device's diagnostic log files will be downloaded to your browser's default Downloads folder.

## View device information

From the Teams admin center, you can view the overall status of all devices in your organization and view details of each device individually.

### Teams Rooms system dashboard

The Teams Rooms system dashboard shows you the status and health of all of your devices at a glance.

### Device details view
