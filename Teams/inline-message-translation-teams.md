Turn on inline message translation in Microsoft Teams 
=================================================

Inline message translation is a new Microsoft Teams feature that lets users automatically translate Teams messages into the [language](https://support.office.com/article/translate-a-message-in-teams-d8926ce9-d6a6-47df-a416-f1adb62d3194) specified by their personal language settings for Office 365.

Inline message translation is being rolled out by default for your organization. If you want to allow users to use this feature within the Teams client, you must turn this setting on.

> [!NOTE]
>This rollout is excluded from Office 365 subscriptions in our Office 365 Government Community Cloud and Office 365 Germany environments.

## Use PowerShell to turn on inline message translation

You can use the messaging policy to turn on the inline message translation.

Turn on the policy by using the [Set-CsTeamsMessagingPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamsmessagingpolicy?view=skype-ps) cmdlet. The policy takes a few minutes to apply. Users might need to sign out and sign back in to Teams.

## Use the Microsoft Teams admin center to turn on inline message translation

In the **Microsoft Teams admin center**, select **Messaging Policies** from the left navigation, then either create a new policy or edit an existing policy, and set the **Allow users to translate messages** option to **On**.

> [!NOTE]
> The service does the translation and delivers it to the client with no effect on the content captured in the compliance records. To learn more about translation, see [What is Microsoft Translator?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/translator-info-overview).
