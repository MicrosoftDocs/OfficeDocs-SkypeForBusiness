# Turn off inline message translation in Microsoft Teams

Inline message translation is a Microsoft Teams feature that lets users translate Teams messages into the [language](https://support.office.com/article/translate-a-message-in-teams-d8926ce9-d6a6-47df-a416-f1adb62d3194) specified by their personal language settings.

Inline message translation is rolled out by default for your organization. You don't need to make changes if you want to allow users to use this feature within the Teams client.

> [!NOTE]
>This rollout is excluded from Office 365 subscriptions in our Office 365 Government Community Cloud and Office 365 Germany environments.

## Use PowerShell to turn off inline message translation

You can use the messaging policy to turn off the inline message translation.

Turn off the policy by using the [Set-CsTeamsMessagingPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamsmessagingpolicy?view=skype-ps) cmdlet. The policy takes a few minutes to apply. Users might need to sign out and sign back in to Teams.

## Use the Microsoft Teams admin center to turn off inline message translation

In the **Microsoft Teams admin center**, select **Messaging Policies** from the left navigation, then either create a new policy or edit an existing policy, and set the **Translate messages** option to **Off**.

> [!NOTE]
> The service does the translation and delivers it to the client with no effect on the content captured in the compliance records. To learn more about translation, see [What is Microsoft Translator?](/azure/cognitive-services/translator/translator-info-overview)
