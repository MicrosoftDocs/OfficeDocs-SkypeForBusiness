# Manage the Whiteboard in Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Whiteboard is a free-form, digital canvas where people, content, and ideas come together. Whiteboard integration in Microsoft Teams meetings is powered by the Whiteboard web app, which lets Teams meeting participants draw, sketch, and write together on a shared digital canvas.

Users can share a whiteboard to make it available to all participants in a Teams meeting. That same whiteboard is simultaneously available in all the Whiteboard applications on Windows 10, iOS, and the web app.

To turn the Whiteboard app on or off, see [Enable Microsoft Whiteboard for your organization](https://support.office.com/article/1caaa2e2-5c18-4bdf-b878-2d98f1da4b24). Keep in mind that this setting will enable or disable Whiteboard for your entire organization, and not just for Teams.

## Whiteboard on Surface Hub

Before trying to use Microsoft Whiteboard, make sure that the Whiteboard app is installed on your Surface Hub device. If Whiteboard isn't installed, on the Surface Hub device, go to the Microsoft Store app, and get [Microsoft Whiteboard](https://www.microsoft.com/p/microsoft-whiteboard/9mspc6mp8fm4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab).
