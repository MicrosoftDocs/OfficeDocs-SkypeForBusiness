Configure an Exchange hybrid organization for use with Microsoft Teams
======================================================================

Generally, you should not have to configure any Exchange Online functionality for use with Microsoft Teams.

This involves enablement of Group Writeback functionality in Azure AD Connect along with various initialization scripts: [Configure Microsoft 365 Groups with on-premises Exchange hybrid](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/hybrid-deployment/set-up-microsoft-365-groups).
