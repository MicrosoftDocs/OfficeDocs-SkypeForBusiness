# Configure an Exchange hybrid organization for use with Microsoft Teams

This involves enablement of Group Writeback functionality in Microsoft Entra Connect along with various initialization scripts: [Configure Microsoft 365 Groups with on-premises Exchange hybrid](/exchange/hybrid-deployment/set-up-microsoft-365-groups).
