# Manage teams in the Microsoft Teams admin center

This article provides an overview of the management tools for Teams in the Microsoft Teams admin center.

As an admin, you may need to view or update the teams in your organization, or you might need to perform remediation actions such as assigning owners for ownerless teams. You can manage teams through both the Teams PowerShell module and the Teams admin center. You can access the admin center at <a href="https://admin.teams.microsoft.com" target="_blank">https://admin.teams.microsoft.com</a>. For full administration capabilities using these two toolsets, you should make sure that you're assigned one of the following roles:

- Global administrator
- Teams administrator

You can learn more about admin roles in Teams in [Use Microsoft Teams admin roles to manage Teams](using-admin-roles.md), and you can read more about how to use the PowerShell cmdlets for managing teams in the [Microsoft Teams cmdlet reference](/powershell/teams/).

## Teams overview grid

Management tools for teams are under the **Teams** node in the Microsoft Teams admin center. (In the admin center, select **Teams** > **Manage teams**.) This page provides a view of all the teams in your organization.

The grid displays the following properties:

- **Team name**
- **Standard channels** - a count of the standard channels in the team.
- **Private channels** - a count of the private channels in the team.
- **Shared channels** - a count of the shared channels in the team.
- **Team members** - a count of total users, including owners, members, and guests for the team.
- **Owners** - a count of owners for this team.
- **Guests** - a count of Azure Active Directory B2B guests who are members of this team.
- **Privacy** - whether the team is public or private.
- **Status** - the [Archived](https://support.office.com/article/dc161cfd-b328-440f-974b-5da5bd98b5a7) or Active status for this team.
- **Description** - the description of the team.
- **Sensitivity** - the sensitivity label associated with the team. (This column may be called *classification* if you haven't set up sensitivity labels.)
- **GroupID** - the unique ID for the Microsoft 365 group associated with the team.
- **Expiration date** - the date the team is scheduled to expire if the team has an [expiration policy](/microsoft-365/solutions/microsoft-365-groups-expiration-policy).

If you don't see all these properties in the grid, select the **Edit columns** icon. In the **Edit columns** pane, you can use the toggles to turn on or turn off columns in the grid. When you're finished, select **Apply**.

### Add a team

To add a new team, click **Add**. In the **Add a new team** pane, give the team a name and description, set whether you want to make it a private or public team, and set the sensitivity if needed.

     3. Click **Apply**.
 
 4. Select the expiring team that you want to renew, select **Renew**, and then select **Confirm**.

 > [!NOTE]
 > If you do not find the team's detail updated immediately, select **Refresh**. Note that it might take some time for the team's details and expiration date to get updated.

## Team profiles

You can navigate to the team profile page of any team from the main teams overview grid by selecting  the team name. The team profile page shows the members, owners, and guests that belong to the team, as well as the team's channels and settings. From the team profile page, you can:

- Add or remove members and owners.
- Add or remove channels (note that you can't remove the General channel).
- Change team and group settings.
 
On the team's profile page, you can select **Edit** and change the following elements of a team:

- **Team name**
- **Description**
- **Privacy** - set whether the team is public or private.
- **Sensitivity** - set the sensitivity label for the team.
- **Member permissions** - set how members interact with messages, channels, and apps.
- **Guest permissions** - set whether guests can add or remove channels.
- **Fun settings** - set whether team members can use giphys, stickers, and memes.

You can also manage members and channels for the team.

The changes that you make to a team are logged. If you're modifying Microsoft 365 group settings (changing the name, description, photo, privacy, sensitivity, or team members), the changes are attributed to you through the audit pipeline. If you're performing actions against Teams-specific settings, your changes are tracked and attributed to you in the General channel of the team.
