# Location of data in Microsoft Teams

Data in Teams resides in the geographic region associated with your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 organization. Currently, Teams supports the Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Norway, Poland, Qatar, South Africa, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland (which includes Liechtenstein), the United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Americas, APAC, and EMEA regions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Teams currently offers data residency in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Norway, Poland, Qatar, South Korea, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland (which includes Liechtenstein), the United Arab Emirates, and United Kingdom for new tenants only.
> A new tenant is defined as any tenant that hasn’t had a single user from the tenant sign in to Teams or its admin user has never signed in to the Teams admin center. Existing tenants from Australia, India, Japan, and South Korea will continue to have their Teams data stored in the APAC region. Existing tenants in Brazil and Canada will continue to have their data stored in the Americas. Existing tenants in France, Germany, Liechtenstein, Norway, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Switzerland will have their data stored in the EMEA region.

## Where your Teams data is stored

To see which region houses data for your tenant, go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home) > **Settings** > **Organization profile**. Scroll down to **Data location**.

For a detailed list of countries/regions and data stored, see [Where your Microsoft 365 customer data is stored](/microsoft-365/enterprise/o365-data-locations).

## Data stored with a third-party storage provider

Organizations who allow users to store files with a third-party storage provider are dependent on the storage location of those services and should, therefore, review the location of data at rest for those services separately.
