# Data, privacy, and security for intelligent recap in Teams Premium

Intelligent recap uses AI to automatically provide a comprehensive overview of your meeting, helping users save time catching up and coordinating next steps. Found on the **Recap** tab in Teams calendar, meeting chat, and in the Meet app, users see AI-powered insights like automatic generated meeting notes, suggested tasks, and personalized highlights to help them quickly find the most important information, even if they miss the meeting. 

Intelligent recap is available as part of Teams Premium, which is an add-on license that provides additional features to make Teams meetings more intelligent, engaging, and protected. To get access to Teams Premium, users should contact the IT admin of their organization.

For an overview of intelligent recap, see [Meeting recap in Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/c2e3a0fe-504f-4b2c-bf85-504938f110ef), or you can watch the [How to use Intelligent recap in Microsoft Teams Premium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-ub_VdpkAI) video.

## What content is used to provide intelligent recap and where is it stored?

To use intelligent recap users must enable [meeting transcription](https://support.microsoft.com/office/dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b) and [recording](https://support.microsoft.com/office/34dfbe7f-b07d-4a27-b4c6-de62f1348c24), which admins can manage with [Recording & transcription meeting policies](../settings-policies-reference.md#related-topics-for-recording--transcription-policies) in the Teams admin center. For meetings that have both recording and transcript enabled, a copy of the transcript is stored in the meeting organizer’s Exchange Online account as well as a copy stored in OneDrive along with the recording. For meetings that only have transcript enabled, a copy of the transcript is stored in the organizer’s Exchange online account. For more information, see the following articles:

- [Configure transcription and captions for Teams meetings](../meeting-transcription-captions.md)
- [Delete the transcript](https://support.microsoft.com/office/dc1a8f23-2e20-4684-885e-2152e06a4a8b#bkmk_delete)
- [Delete a video's transcript and captions file](https://support.microsoft.com/office/da0c37a4-b32b-4394-9ab7-e975ab94a0f2)

The following table shows what content is used to provide intelligent recap and where that content is stored. All the features listed in the table follow the meeting recording retention policy. For more information, see [Teams meeting recording](../meeting-recording.md?tabs=meeting-policy) and [Learn about retention for Microsoft Teams](/purview/retention-policies-teams).

## How Microsoft uses data to provide intelligent recap

Customer data isn‘t logged or used for any AI model training or testing.

Intelligent recap automatically inherits your organization’s security, compliance, and privacy policies for Microsoft Teams.

Intelligent recap abides by Microsoft’s commitments to data security and privacy in the enterprise. Data is managed in accordance with our current commitments, while the existing compliance boundaries and privacy protections make intelligent recap the AI solution you can trust. For more information, see [Privacy and Microsoft Teams](../teams-privacy.md) and [regional and country compliance information on the Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/compliance/regional-country-compliance).

Intelligent recap also abides by Microsoft’s commitments to data residency in the enterprise. Data in Teams resides in the geographic region associated with your Microsoft 365 (or Office 365) organization. Intelligent recap is also [multi-geo](/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo) capable, for tenants that span multiple geographic locations. To review Microsoft’s data residency policy and documentation, see [Data Residency Overview and Definitions](/microsoft-365/enterprise/m365-dr-overview).

## What parts of intelligent recap are using OpenAI’s GPT Model?

Currently, only AI-generated notes and AI-generated tasks in intelligent recap use a GPT model from Open AI through [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services/openai-service/). However, more AI-based features might leverage GPT in future versions of Teams Premium.

Customer data isn’t shared with non-Microsoft parties, including with Open AI. Microsoft runs the GPT-based models internally using a dedicated GPT service (Azure OpenAI). This dedicated service runs within the compliance boundaries that are used only for Microsoft 365 (and Office 365) services. AI-generated notes and AI-generated tasks call this dedicated and compliant GPT service, as well as other internal AI models, to produce AI-generated notes and tasks.
