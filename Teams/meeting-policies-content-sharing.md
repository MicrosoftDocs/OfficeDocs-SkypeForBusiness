# Manage meeting policies for content sharing

**APPLIES TO:** ✔️Meetings ✔️Webinars

Content sharing settings control how users present a screen or app during a meeting or chat. You can configure admin settings for screen sharing mode, PowerPoint sharing, whiteboard, and shared notes. (For information about how to manage who can present and who can request control, see [Manage who can present and request control in Teams meetings](meeting-who-present-request-control.md).)

> [!NOTE]
> Meeting policies for content sharing also apply to webinars.

To change a content sharing setting
1. In the Teams admin center, expand **Meetings** and select **Meeting policies**.
1. Select the policy that you want to edit.
1. Scroll to the **Content sharing** section.
1. Select the settings you want to use (described below).
1. Select **Save**.

#### Use PowerShell to configure content sharing

You can also use the [Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamsmeetingpolicy) cmdlet to control the content sharing settings. Set the following parameters:

- ScreenSharingMode
- AllowPowerPointSharing
- AllowWhiteboard
- AllowSharedNotes

[Learn more about using the csTeamsMeetingPolicy cmdlet](/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamsmeetingpolicy).

## Screen sharing mode

This setting is a per-user policy. The setting controls whether a user can share a desktop and window in a Teams meeting.

|Setting value |Behavior  |
|---------|---------|
|**Entire screen**    | Full desktop sharing and application sharing are allowed in the meeting. |
|**Single application**   | Application sharing is allowed in the meeting. If your users are using Teams in a web browser and are assigned this value, this setting will function as **Not enabled**.  |
|**Not enabled**     |Screen sharing and application sharing turned off in the meeting.       |

### PowerPoint Live

This is a per-user policy. This setting controls whether the user can share PowerPoint slide decks in a meeting. External participants, including anonymous, guest, and external access users, inherit the policy of the meeting organizer.

Let's look at the following example.

|User |Meeting policy  |PowerPoint Live |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Daniela   | Global   | On       |
|Amanda   | Location1MeetingPolicy        | Off   |

Amanda can't share PowerPoint slide decks in meetings even if she's the meeting organizer. Daniela can share PowerPoint slide decks even if the meeting is organized by Amanda. Amanda can view the PowerPoint slide decks shared by others in the meeting, even though she can't share PowerPoint slide decks.

## Whiteboard

Microsoft Whiteboard is a free-form, digital canvas where people, content, and ideas come together. Whiteboard integration in Microsoft Teams meetings is powered by the Whiteboard web app, which lets Teams meeting participants draw, sketch, and write together on a shared digital canvas.

Users can share a whiteboard to make it available to all participants in a Teams meeting. That same whiteboard is simultaneously available in all the Whiteboard applications on Windows 10, iOS, and the web app.

To turn the Whiteboard app on or off, see [Enable Microsoft Whiteboard for your organization](https://support.office.com/article/1caaa2e2-5c18-4bdf-b878-2d98f1da4b24). Keep in mind that this setting will enable or disable Whiteboard for your entire organization, and not just for Teams.

Whiteboards will be created in the OneDrive of the person who starts the whiteboard. For more information, see [Manage data for Microsoft Whiteboard](/microsoft-365/whiteboard/manage-data-organizations).

The Whiteboard setting for Teams meetings is a per-user setting. This setting controls whether a user can share the whiteboard in a meeting. External participants, including anonymous, guest, and external access users, inherit the policy of the meeting organizer.

Let's look at the following example.

|User |Meeting policy  |Whiteboard|
|---------|---------|---------|
|Daniela   | Global   | On       |
|Amanda   | Location1MeetingPolicy        | Off   |

Amanda can't share the whiteboard in a meeting even if she's the meeting organizer. Daniela can share the whiteboard even if a meeting is organized by Amanda.

To enable Whiteboard using PowerShell, set the IsWBFluidEnabled cmdlet to $true from [Set-SPOTenant](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant).

For information for your end users about how to use Whiteboard, see [Use Whiteboard in Microsoft Teams](https://support.office.com/article/7a6e7218-e9dc-4ccc-89aa-b1a0bb9c31ee).

#### Whiteboard on Surface Hub

Before trying to use Microsoft Whiteboard, make sure that the Whiteboard app is installed on your Surface Hub device. If Whiteboard isn't installed, on the Surface Hub device, go to the Microsoft Store app, and get [Microsoft Whiteboard](https://www.microsoft.com/p/microsoft-whiteboard/9mspc6mp8fm4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab). For more information, see [Enable Microsoft Whiteboard on Surface Hub](https://support.office.com/article/enable-microsoft-whiteboard-on-surface-hub-b5df4539-f735-42ff-b22a-0f5e21be7627).

#### Annotations

When whiteboard is enabled, users will have the option to use annotations, a feature that allows participants to collaborate while sharing their screen in a Teams meeting. If Whiteboard is not enabled, users will not have access to annotations.

Use the following to turn on/off collaborative annotations:

```
Set-SPOTenant -IsWBFluidEnabled
```

> [!NOTE]
> This will also turn on/off Whiteboard in meetings.

The admin policy for collaborative annotations is a user-level policy and following are its details:

  - **Policy name**: CSTeamsMeetingPolicy
  
  - **Setting name**: AllowCollaborativeAnnotations

  - **Setting type**: ENUM true/false

The admin can either run the PowerShell syntax above or turn on/off the policy in the Teams admin center through **Meetings** > **Meeting policies** > **Collaborative Annotations**.

## Shared notes

This setting is a per-user policy. This setting controls whether a user can create and share notes in a meeting. External participants, including anonymous, guests, and external access, inherit the policy of the meeting organizer. The **Meeting Notes** tab is currently only supported in meetings that have fewer than 20 participants.

Let's look at the following example.

|User |Meeting policy  |Shared notes |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Daniela   | Global   | On       |
|Amanda   | Location1MeetingPolicy | Off |

Daniela can take notes in Amanda's meetings and Amanda can't take notes in any meetings.
