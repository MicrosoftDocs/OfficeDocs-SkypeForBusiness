After you've verified if one of the Teams services is available, you can see [Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](../teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md) to help you buy licenses and assign them to your users.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you need to get more telephone numbers for your users, see [Getting phone numbers for your users](../getting-phone-numbers-for-your-users.md) or, for phone number request forms, [Manage phone numbers for your organization](../manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization.md).

## Want to learn more about these services

### Audio Conferencing

Sometimes people in your organization will need to use a phone to call in to a meeting. Teams includes the Audio Conferencing feature for just this situation! People can call in to meetings using a phone instead of using the Teams apps on a mobile device or PC. When you've decided that you want Audio Conferencing for your organization, buy one **Audio Conferencing** license for each person in your organization who is going to schedule/host an audio meeting.
  
With Audio Conferencing, there are toll and toll free phone numbers that can be used by your users to dial in to meetings. Toll numbers from the following countries or regions are automatically assigned as shared audio conferencing numbers to organizations when they're enabled for Audio Conferencing. Dedicated toll and toll free numbers can be assigned to your organization from additional cities.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There isn't a resource that contains a listing of all of the dial-in numbers for Audio Conferencing. To find out if there are dial-in phone numbers available in your area or country/region, go to **Teams admin center** > **Voice** > **Phone Numbers**, click **Add**, and then click **New Service Numbers**. Use the lists for **Country/Region**, **State/Region**, and **City** to filter your search. If you are looking for toll free service numbers, select **toll free** from the **State/Region** list.

To see more about Audio Conferencing, see [Audio Conferencing common questions](../audio-conferencing-common-questions.md)

[Pricing for Audio Conferencing](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=799762)
  
#### Using the Call Me feature or when adding other people to a meeting so they can join it

In Audio Conferencing, the "*Call Me*" feature is used to let other people join a dial-in meeting. Use the drop-down list in this article to search for the country/region and see if this feature is available.

> [!CAUTION]
> Dialing out to toll free or free phone numbers may not be possible, because some toll free numbers only function from within a certain country or area within a country. For example, if you dial out from the United States to a toll free number in Brazil, the call may not be successful because the call didn't originate from within Brazil or from a specific region within Brazil. The ability to dial out to toll free numbers varies widely depending on the restrictions of the toll free number dialed. Unfortunately, we can't control this behavior, and as a result, your experience may vary depending on the toll free number dialed and the restrictions of the toll free number.
  
Dialing out from a meeting to another country/region in the world that isn't listed below is available using [Communication Credits](../what-are-communications-credits.md). For those users, you'll need to [Set up Communications Credits for your organization](../set-up-communications-credits-for-your-organization.md).

### Phone System

With Phone System, you create auto attendants and call queues (with a toll or toll free number) to answer incoming calls for your organization. When you add a Calling Plan for users, they can use Teams to take care of basic call-control tasks, such as placing and receiving calls, transferring calls, and muting and unmuting calls. **Phone System** users click a name in their address book, and Teams will place a call to that person. To place and receive calls, **Phone System** users use their mobile devices, a headset with a laptop or PC, or one of many IP phones that work with Teams.

The availability of toll phone numbers from some of these locations might vary at any given time depending on inventory levels. In addition to getting phone numbers for individual users, it's also possible to search and acquire toll or toll free phone numbers for services such as Audio Conferencing (for conference bridges), auto attendants and call queues. These are called service numbers. See [Getting service phone numbers](../getting-service-phone-numbers.md) to get phone numbers. But for your users, after you assign a Calling Plan to them, you can assign a user phone number so they can make and receive phone calls. To find those phone numbers, go to [Getting phone numbers for your users](../getting-phone-numbers-for-your-users.md). You can also see [Assign, change, or remove a phone number for a user](../assign-change-or-remove-a-phone-number-for-a-user.md).

[Pricing for Phone System](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/voice-calling?#office-StandaloneSKU-pkdogb9)

> [!NOTE]
> The availability of toll phone numbers from some of these locations might vary at any given time depending on inventory levels.

Use the drop-down list at the top of the page to search for a country or region and what services are available.

### Microsoft Teams Calling Plans

Along with Phone System, Calling Plans let users make and receive phone calls. You first get a user (subscriber) phone number (not a service number) to assign to the user, and then assign a Calling Plan. There are three types of Calling Plans available: **Domestic**, **International**, and **Pay-As-You-Go**. See [Calling Plans for Microsoft Teams](../calling-plans-for-office-365.md) for more details.

You can also see [Microsoft Teams add-on licensing options](../teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md) for licensing information.

> [!NOTE]
> The country/region is based on the location of the user's license in the **Microsoft 365 admin center** > **Active Users** and **not** the billing address listed under the **Organization Profile** in the **Microsoft 365 admin center**.
  
### Toll and toll free phone numbers for services

In addition to getting phone numbers for individual users, it's also possible to search and acquire toll or toll free phone numbers for services such as Audio Conferencing (for conference bridges), auto attendants, and call queues. These are called service numbers.
  
The following is a list of capitals and major cities from where you can get toll service numbers to use with Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans. You get toll service numbers from these locations using the **Teams admin center**.
  
If you want to get a toll or toll free service number, you can see [Getting service phone numbers](../getting-service-phone-numbers.md). If you already have a toll or toll free service number that you want to transfer from a different provider, see [Manage phone numbers for your organization](../manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization.md).

Use the drop-down list at the top of the page to search for a country or region and what services are available.

### Communications Credits

We recommend that you set up Communications Credits for your Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans users that need the ability to dial out to **any destination**. Many countries/regions are included, but some destinations might not be included in your Calling Plan or Audio Conferencing subscriptions.
  
If you don't set up Communications Credits and assign a license to users, and you run out of minutes for your organization (depending on your Calling Plan or Audio Conferencing plan or your country/region), they won't be able to make calls or dial out from meetings. You can find out more information including recommended funding amounts by reading [What are Communications Credits?](../what-are-communications-credits.md)
