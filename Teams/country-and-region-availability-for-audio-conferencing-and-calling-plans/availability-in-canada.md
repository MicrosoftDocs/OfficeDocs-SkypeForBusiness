> [!Note]
> When a Calling Plan (domestic or domestic and international) user in the U.S. dials a phone number in Canada, it will be treated as a domestic call. This is also the case when a user in Canada dials a phone number in the U.S. However, if you also use calling plan policies to limit user dial-out to “domestic” only, a U.S. user won't be able to call Canada and likewise, a Canada user won't be able to call a U.S. user.

> [!Note]
> Calls to the U.S. are treated as domestic calls.
