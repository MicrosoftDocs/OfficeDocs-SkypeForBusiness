# Customize your organization's app store in Microsoft Teams

You can customize your organization's app store to reflect your company branding. You can add your logo, a custom background, and custom text colors to make it more inviting for end users.

You can access the customized store in the Teams admin center by selecting **Teams apps** > **[Customize store](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/customize-appstore)**. Follow the below instructions for the details of the changes.

## Customize your organization logo

<a name="orglogo"> </a>
<!-- Do not remove the bookmark link above. -->

Here you can upload your organization logo. The logo selected will appear in the Teams client in **Apps** > **Built for your org** page.

When you select the **Choose a picture** option, you can upload the file of your choice. The logo should be 240x60, or it will be scaled to that size. It should be no larger than 5 MB. The supported formats are .svg, .png, and .jpg.

The logo is shown in the top, right corner of the tenant app catalog in the Teams store.

## Customize the background color

<a name="custombackground"> </a>
<!-- Do not remove the bookmark link above. -->

Make sure that the background has enough contrast with the text so the users can read the text clearly. The background will appear in the Teams client in **Apps** > **Built for your org** header.

Your options are:

* Use Teams client default background theme
* Choose a picture. When you select the background picture, you can upload the file of your choice. The background should be 1212x100 pixels, or it will be scaled to that size. It should be no larger than 5 MB. The supported formats are .svg, .png, and .jpg.
* Choose a custom background. When you select **Choose a custom color**, a color chooser opens. Select the color that you want by adjusting the scale of the color chooser.

The background image or color is used as the background for the top banner in the Teams tenant app catalog.

## Customize the text color of your name

<a name="textcolor"> </a>
<!-- Do not remove the bookmark link above. -->

Provide enough contrast to the text color as compared to the background so that the end-users can read the name of your organization clearly. The text appears in the Teams client in **Apps** > **Built for your org** header.

When you select **Choose a custom color**, a color chooser opens. Select the color that you want by adjusting the scale of the color chooser.
