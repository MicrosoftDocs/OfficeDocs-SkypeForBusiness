# Shared line appearance in Microsoft Teams

Shared line appearance lets a user choose a delegate to answer or handle calls on their behalf. This feature is helpful if a user has an administrative assistant who regularly handles the user's calls. In the context of shared line appearance, a manager is someone who authorizes a delegate to make or receive calls on their behalf. A delegate can make or receive calls on behalf of the delegator.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is only available in Teams Only deployment mode. For more details on Teams deployment modes, see [Understand Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business coexistence and interoperability](teams-and-skypeforbusiness-coexistence-and-interoperability.md)

## License required

Both managers and delegates must have a Phone System license with PSTN connectivity (Calling Plan, Operator Connect, or Direct Routing). The shared line experience is part of delegation and is included with Phone System. For more information on licensing, see [Microsoft Teams service description](/office365/servicedescriptions/teams-service-description).

## Shared line appearance feature availability

Shared line appearance is currently supported by the following apps and devices.

| Capability | Teams Desktop | Teams Mac App | Teams Web App (Edge) |Teams mobile iOS/Android App | Teams IP phone |
|------------|---------------|---------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|
| Set up delegation | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| Receive calls on behalf of another | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Call a phone number on behalf of another | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Call a Teams user on behalf of another | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| See the delegate view of shared lines | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| See the delegate view of manager's call activities | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| See the manager view of delegates | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| Delegate or manager can hold or resume | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |

## Limitations

Managers can add up to 25 delegates, and delegates can have up to 25 managers. There is no limit to the number of delegation relationships that can be created in a tenant. 
 
If the delegator and delegate are not in the same geographic location, the PSTN provider must allow caller ID to show up from a different geographic location for a delegated call. 

Circular delegation configuration is not permitted. If the delegated users also have delegations between them, they will only be able to see their delegation and not the initial delegation.

## Enable delegation and shared line appearance

You enable delegation by using the **TeamsCallingPolicy AllowDelegation** setting. You can use Teams admin center or Teamms PowerShell. 

When enabled, the end user can configure their delegation relationships directly in Teams. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you turn off delegation for a user, you also need to clean up delegation relationships for that user in the Teams admin center to avoid incorrect call routing.

## Use Teams admin center

To configure delegation and shared line appearance by using Teams admin center, see [Configure call settings for your users](/MicrosoftTeams/user-call-settings).

## Use PowerShell

To configure delegation and shared line appearance by using Teams PowerShell, use the following cmdlets:

- [New-CsUserCallingDelegate](/powershell/module/teams/new-csusercallingdelegate)

- [Set-CsUserCallingDelegate](/powershell/module/teams/set-csusercallingdelegate)

- [Remove-CsUserCallingDelegate](/powershell/module/teams/remove-csusercallingdelegate)

### Examples

In the following example, user2@contoso.com is added as a delegate of user1@contoso.com with permissions to make and receive call on behalf of user1, and to change settings for other delegates:

```powershell
New-CsUserCallingDelegate -Identity user1@contoso.com -Delegate user2@contoso.com -MakeCalls $true -ReceiveCalls $true -ManageSettings $true
```

In the next example, delegate user2@contoso.com is not allowed to make calls anymore on behalf of user1:

```powershell
Set-CsUserCallingDelegate -Identity user1@contoso.com -Delegate user2@contoso.com -MakeCalls $false
```

In the next example, user2@contoso.com is removed as a delegate of user1@contoso.com:

```powershell
Remove-CsUserCallingDelegate -Identity user1@contoso.com -Delegate user2@contoso.com
```
