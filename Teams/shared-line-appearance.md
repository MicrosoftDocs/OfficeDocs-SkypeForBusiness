# Shared line appearance in Microsoft Teams

Shared line appearance is part of the delegation feature that lets a user choose a delegate to answer or handle calls on their behalf. This feature is helpful if a user has an administrative assistant who regularly handles the userâ€™s calls. In the context of shared line appearance, a manager is someone who authorizes a delegate to make or receive calls on their behalf, and a delegate can make and receive calls on behalf of someone else.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is only available in Teams Only deployment mode. For more details on Teams deployment modes, see [Understand Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business coexistence and interoperability](teams-and-skypeforbusiness-coexistence-and-interoperability.md)

## License required

A user must be an enterprise voice user to be a delegate or set up delegation and enable others to make or receive calls on their behalf.

Both managers and delegates need to be enterprise voice enabled. The shared line experience is part of delegation, and requires no additional license. For additional details on the licensing model, See [Office 365 licensing for Microsoft Teams](office-365-licensing.md).

## Configuring delegation and shared line appearance

Delegation and shared line appearance are user-driven features: there are no admin settings to configure. For information about how to use the feature, see [Share a phone line with a delegate](https://support.office.com/article/share-a-phone-line-with-a-delegate-16307929-a51f-43fc-8323-3b1bf115e5a8)
