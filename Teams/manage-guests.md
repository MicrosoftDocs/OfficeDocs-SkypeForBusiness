Guest access is included with all Office 365 Business Premium, Office 365 Enterprise, and Office 365 Education subscriptions. No additional Office 365 license is necessary.
  
    
    
Teams guest access is a tenant-level setting and is turned off by default. IT admins can add guests at the tenant level, set and manage guest user policies and permissions, determine which users can invite guests, and pull reports on guest user activity. These controls are available through the Office 365 admin center. Guest user content and activities are under the same compliance and auditing protection as the rest of Office 365.
  
    
    

> [!NOTE]
> The Teams guest access tenant setting only prevents guest sign-in. Team owners will be able to invite new guests and add existing directory guest users to their respective teams. As a reminder, Teams always honors Azure Active Directory external settings to allow or prevent guest user addition to the tenant. 
  
    
    

In addition, you can use the Azure Active Directory portal to manage guests and their access to Office 365 and Teams resources. Teams guest access makes use of Azure Active Directory business-to-business (B2B) collaboration capabilities as the underlying infrastructure to store security principles information such as identity properties, memberships, and multi-factor authentication settings. To learn more about Azure Active Directory B2B, see [What is Azure AD B2B collaboration?](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=853011) and [Azure Active Directory B2B collaboration FAQs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=853020).
