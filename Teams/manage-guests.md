Manage guest access in Microsoft Teams
======================================

**Guest** is a user/license type in Microsoft Teams that is included with all Office 365 Business Premium, Office 365 Enterprise, and Office 365 Education subscriptions. No additional Office 365 license is necessary. Teams guest access is a tenant-level setting and is turned off by default. For details about how to enable guest access, see [Turn on or off guest access to Microsoft Teams](set-up-guests.md).

After the **Guest** user/license type is turned on, you can configure settings for guests via the controls described in [Manage Microsoft Teams features in your Office 365 organization](enable-features-office-365.md) and [Manage Teams during the transition to the new Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business Admin Center](manage-teams-skypeforbusiness-admin-center.md).     
    
IT admins can add guests at the tenant level, set and manage guest user policies and permissions, and pull reports on guest user activity. These controls are available through the Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business Admin Center. Guest user content and activities are under the same compliance and auditing protection as the rest of Office 365.

Team owners can invite new guests and add existing directory guest users to their teams. Team owners can identify guest users via **Teams** > **Manage teams**, and set channel-related capabilities for guests via **Org-wide settings** > **Guest access**, including allowing guests to create, update, and delete channels, as shown in the following screenshot.

You can use the Azure Active Directory portal to manage guests and their access to Office 365 and Teams resources. Teams guest access makes use of Azure Active Directory business-to-business (B2B) collaboration capabilities as the underlying infrastructure to store security principles information such as identity properties, memberships, and multi-factor authentication settings. To learn more about Azure Active Directory B2B, see [What is Azure AD B2B collaboration?](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=853011) and [Azure Active Directory B2B collaboration FAQs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=853020).

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Teams always honors Azure Active Directory external settings to allow or prevent guest user additions to the tenant. For more details, see [Authorize guest access in Microsoft Teams](Teams-dependencies.md).
  
## Review guest access periodically

In Teams, you can add 5 guests for each licensed user. Because of this limitation, or because you want to keep your tenant up to date, you should review guest access periodically to identify users who have access that they don't need anymore. You can use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to create an access review for group members or users assigned to an application. Creating recurring access reviews can save you time. If you need to routinely review users who have access to an application or are members of a group, you can define the frequency of those reviews. 

You can perform a guest access review yourself, ask guests to review their own membership, or ask an application owner or business decision maker to perform the access review. You use the Azure portal to perform guest access reviews. For more information, see [Manage guest access with Azure AD access reviews](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/governance/manage-guest-access-with-access-reviews).

###  Prerequisites

Access reviews are available with the Premium P2 edition of Azure AD, which is included in Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security, E5. For more information, see "Choose an edition" in [Azure Active Directory editions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis). Each user who interacts with this feature by creating a review, filling out a review, or confirming their access, must have a license. 

If you plan to ask guest users to review their own access, read about guest user licensing. For more information, see [Azure AD B2B collaboration licensing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/b2b/licensing-guidance).

## Guest access latencies

The guest settings are set in Azure Active Directory. It takes 2 hours to 24 hours for the changes to be effective across your Office 365 organization. If a user sees the message "Contact your administrator" when they try to add a guest to their team, it's likely that either the guest feature hasn't been enabled or the settings aren't effective yet.

## More information

For information about using PowerShell to manage guest access, see [Use PowerShell to control guest access to a team](guest-access-powershell.md).
