# Configure external meetings and chat with Skype for Business Server

If you're using Skype for Business Server by itself or in a hybrid configuration with Teams in Microsoft 365, you can configure chat and meetings with people in other Microsoft 365 organizations and chat and calling with Skype users.

> [!NOTE]
> Chat with unmanaged Teams users (those not connected to an organization) is not supported for on-premises only organizations. To configure this for Teams in Microsoft 365, see [Manage external meetings and chat with people and organizations using Microsoft identities](trusted-organizations-external-meetings-chat.md).

## Configure external meetings and chat with other Microsoft 365 organizations

To allow chatting and meetings with other Microsoft 365 organizations, configure your Skype for Business Server environment as follows:
- Ensure federation is enabled in `CsAccessEdgeConfiguration`.
- Ensure federation for the user is enabled through `ExternalAccessPolicy` (either through the global policy, site policy, or user assigned policy).
- If you are not using open federation, ensure the target domain is listed in `AllowedDomains`.

If you are using Microsoft 365 with Skype for Business Server in a hybrid configuration, configure external meetings and chat in Microsoft 365 as described in [Manage external meetings and chat with people and organizations using Microsoft identities](trusted-organizations-external-meetings-chat.md). Note that organizations that you're communicating with must also trust your organization.

## Configure external chat and calling with Skype users

To allow chatting and calls with Skype users, configure your Skype for Business Server environment as follows:
- Ensure Skype is enabled as a federated partner.
- Ensure `EnablePublicCloudAccess=true` for the user through `ExternalAccessPolicy` (either via global policy, site policy, or user assigned policy).

If you are using Microsoft 365 with Skype for Business Server in a hybrid configuration, configure external chat and calling with Skype users in Microsoft 365 as described in [Manage external meetings and chat with people and organizations using Microsoft identities](/microsoftteams/trusted-organizations-external-meetings-chat#manage-chat-and-calls-with-skype-users).
