# Customize meeting invitations (IT admins)

You can customize Teams meeting invitations to meet your organization's needs. You can add your organization's logo and include helpful information, such as links to your support website and legal disclaimer, and a text-only footer.

> [!NOTE]
> Logos added to a meeting theme override the logos you upload to meeting invitations. To learn more about meeting themes, see [Create and manage meeting themes for Teams meetings](meeting-themes.md).

## Tips for creating a logo for meeting invitations

1. Create an image that's no more than 188 pixels wide by 30 pixels tall (it's small).
2. Save the image in JPG or PNG format.
3. Store the image in a location that everyone receiving the invitation can access, such as a public website.

Now that you have your logo, you can customize your meeting invitations.

## Customize your meeting invitations using the Teams admin center

1. Navigate to the Teams admin center
2. In the left navigation, go to **Meetings** > **Meeting settings**.
3. Under **Email invitation**, do the following:

    - **Logo URL** Enter the URL where your logo is stored.
    - **Privacy and security URL** If your organization has a legal website that you want people to go to for any legal concerns, enter the URL here.
    - **Help URL** If your organization has a support website that you want people to go to if they run into issues, enter the URL here.
    - **Footer** Enter text that you want to include as a footer.
4. Select **Preview invite** to see a preview of your meeting invitation.
5. When you're done, select **Save**.
6. Wait an hour or so for the changes to propagate and schedule a Teams meeting to see what the meeting invitation looks like.
