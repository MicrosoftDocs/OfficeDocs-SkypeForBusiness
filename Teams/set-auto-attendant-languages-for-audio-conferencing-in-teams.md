# Set auto attendant languages for Audio Conferencing in Microsoft Teams

The Audio Conferencing auto attendant for Microsoft Teams can greet audio callers in different languages when they join a meeting.
  
As an admin, you can choose one default and up to four alternate languages. The auto attendant uses your chosen default language first, followed by the alternate languages in the order that you picked.
  
> [!NOTE]
> You only have the option to change the languages of Dedicated audio conferencing numbers. You can't change the languages for Shared audio conferencing numbers.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [updating-admin-interfaces](includes/updating-admin-interfaces.md)]
  
## Set the conferencing auto attendant languages

Using the Microsoft Teams admin center:

1. Navigate to **Meetings** > **Conference Bridges**.

2. Select a **Dedicated** audio conferencing phone number from the list, and at the top of the page, select **Edit**. The **Edit** option is only shown when a Dedicated audio conferencing number is selected.

3. In the pane on the right, choose the default language you want and any alternate languages.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The supported default and alternate languages are listed. The order of alternate languages that you choose in the dropdowns is the order of the languages presented to callers.

4. Select **Save**.
