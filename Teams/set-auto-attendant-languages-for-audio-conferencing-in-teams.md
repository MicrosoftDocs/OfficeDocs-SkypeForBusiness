# Set auto attendant languages for Audio Conferencing in Microsoft Teams

The Audio Conferencing auto attendant for Microsoft Teams can greet audio callers in a number of different languages when they join a meeting.
  
Choose one primary language and up to four secondary languages. The primary language that you set will be used first and the secondary languages will be used by the auto-attendant in order that you select. 
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can only change the languages of audio conferencing numbers that are of the Dedicated category. The languages of Shared audio conferencing number can't be changed.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [updating-admin-interfaces](includes/updating-admin-interfaces.md)]
