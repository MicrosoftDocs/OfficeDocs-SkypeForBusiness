# Use Microsoft Teams administrator roles to manage Teams

Using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you can designate administrators who need different levels of access for managing Microsoft Teams. Administrators can manage the entire Teams workload, or they can have delegated permissions for troubleshooting call quality problems or managing your organization's telephony needs. 

## Teams roles and capabilities

There are four Teams admin roles available: Teams service administrator, Teams communications administrator, Teams communications support specialist, and Teams communications support engineer. Review the following table to understand what each role can do and which tools the admin can use in the Microsoft Teams admin center and PowerShell.

## Assign users to each role

You can assign users to these roles in Azure AD. To learn how to assign administrative roles to a user in Azure AD, see [Assign a user to administrator roles in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal).

## Cmdlets available for each role

Most of the PowerShell tools for these admin roles live in the Skype for Business PowerShell module, and it's important to note that some of the cmdlets that these admin roles have access to control shared settings that are also used for Skype for Business Online. The Skype for Business admin role also has access to all the cmdlets in the Skype for Business PowerShell module.

To view the full list of cmdlets currently available to a given role in the Skype for Business PowerShell module, follow these steps:

1. Assign that role to a user (and make sure that the user has no other roles).
2. Connect to the Skype for Business PowerShell module:<br>
   a. $session = new-csonlinesession<br>
   b. Import-pssession $session<br>
   c. Use **Get-Module** to identify the name of the imported session (it will be a randomly generated name).<br>
3. Use **Get-Command -Module** <*name from above*> to identify all available cmdlets
