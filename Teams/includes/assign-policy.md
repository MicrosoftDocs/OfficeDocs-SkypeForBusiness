You can assign a policy directly to users, either individually or at scale through a batch assignment (if supported for the policy type), or to a group that the users are members of (if supported for the policy type). 

To learn about the different ways that you can assign policies to users, see [Assign policies to your users in Teams](../policy-assignment-overview.md).
