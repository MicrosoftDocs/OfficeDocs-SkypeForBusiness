In the next step you'll create a resource account for your Teams Rooms console. Before you do that, you need to purchase a license because each resource account you want to associate with a Teams Rooms console needs a Teams Rooms license.

Follow the steps below to purchase a Teams Room Basic or Teams Rooms Pro license that you can assign to a resource account in a later step. For a comparison between the Teams Rooms Basic and Teams Rooms Pro licenses, see [Teams Meeting Room Licensing Update](../rooms/rooms-licensing.md).
