The new Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business Admin Center is here! Starting in March 2018, we've been gradually migrating settings to it from both the current Skype for Business admin center and the Microsoft Teams experience in the Office 365 admin center. If a setting has been migrated, you'll see a notification and then be directed to the setting's location in the new Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business Admin Center. For more information, see [Manage Teams during the transition to the new Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business Admin Center](../manage-teams-skypeforbusiness-admin-center.md).
