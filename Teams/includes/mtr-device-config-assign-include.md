After you create the resource account, you need to assign a license to it. The resource account needs a Microsoft Teams Rooms Basic or Teams Rooms Pro license to sign into a Microsoft Teams Rooms device. For more information, see [Microsoft Teams Rooms licenses](../rooms/rooms-licensing.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Teams Rooms Basic and Microsoft Teams Rooms Pro are the two available SKUs for shared meeting room devices, including Teams Rooms. A meeting room license is required for Teams displays with hot-desking. For more information, see [Teams meeting room licensing](/microsoftteams/rooms/rooms-licensing).

To assign licenses using the Microsoft 365 admin center, do the following:

1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center.
1. Provide the admin credentials for your Microsoft 365 tenant.
1. Go to **Users** > **Active users**.
1. Select the resource account you created in the previous step.
1. In the right pane, select **Licenses and Apps**.
1. Expand the **Licenses** section, select the license you purchased in [Step 1 - Purchase a Teams Rooms license](../hybrid-meetings-device-config-license.md), then select **Save changes**.
