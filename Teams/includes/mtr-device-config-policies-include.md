You may need to apply custom network, bandwidth, or meeting policies to this account. For more information on network and bandwidth policies, see [Meeting policy settings for audio & video](/microsoftteams/meeting-policies-audio-and-video). For Teams Rooms, we recommend you set the meeting policy bandwidth to 10 Mbps.

For collaboration purposes, turn on PowerPoint Live, Whiteboard, and shared notes. It is recommended that you enable the meeting policy setting "Meet now in private meetings". You may want to create a meeting policy to adjust participants and guest settings for Teams Rooms. For example, review the lobby settings such as which attendees to automatically admit to meetings. For more information on Teams meeting policies, see [Manage meeting policies in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/meeting-policies-overview).
