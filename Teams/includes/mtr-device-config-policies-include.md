We recommend you enable the meeting policy setting "Meet now in private meetings" to ensure the "Meet now" functionality on the Teams Rooms console functions. For more information on Teams meeting policies, see [Manage meeting policies in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/meeting-policies-overview).

Teams Rooms devices include a Net Promotor Score (NPS) survey, this survey can be controlled with Teams feedback policies. For more information, see [Manage feedback policies in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/manage-feedback-policies-in-teams).

Teams public preview can be enabled on Teams devices to see Teams features earlier than general availability. For more information, see [Microsoft Teams Public preview](/microsoftteams/public-preview-doc-updates?tabs=new-teams-client) on how to enable public preview.
