It is also recommended that you enable the meeting policy setting "Meet now in private meetings" to ensure the "Meet now" functionality on the Teams Rooms console functions. For more information on Teams meeting policies, see [Manage meeting policies in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/meeting-policies-overview).
