> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft 365 resource accounts aren't the same as Teams resource accounts. Teams resource accounts can be used with call queues and auto attendants to accept phone calls from external phone numbers. Microsoft 365 resource accounts are tied to an Exchange Online mailbox and enable booking of shared resources, such as rooms, projectors, and so on.
