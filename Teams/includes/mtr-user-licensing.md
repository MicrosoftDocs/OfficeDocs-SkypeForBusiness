> User licenses aren't supported for use with meeting devices. User licenses that have been assigned to teams meeting devices need to be replaced by a Teams Rooms Basic or Teams Rooms Pro license prior to July 1, 2023. Meeting devices that have a user license after July 1, 2023 will be blocked from signing in until a Teams Rooms license is assigned.
