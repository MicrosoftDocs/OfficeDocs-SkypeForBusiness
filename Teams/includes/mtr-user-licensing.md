> User licenses aren't supported for use with meeting devices. User licenses that have been assigned to Teams Rooms devices need to be replaced by an approved Teams Rooms license. As of September 30, 2023, Meeting devices that do not have a Team Rooms license will be blocked from signing in until a Teams Rooms license is assigned.
>
> Also, **Microsoft Teams Shared Devices** licenses aren't supported on and won't work with Teams Rooms devices. Teams Rooms devices should only be assigned Teams Rooms Basic or Teams Rooms Pro licenses (Teams Rooms legacy licenses are also valid).
