You can improve your Teams Rooms meeting experience by customizing how the resource account responds to, and processes, meeting invitations. Using Exchange Online PowerShell, you can set the following resource account properties:

- **AutomateProcessing: `AutoAccept`** Meeting organizers receive the room reservation decision directly without human intervention.

- **AddOrganizerToSubject: `$false`** The meeting organizer isn't added to the subject of the meeting request.

- **DeleteComments: `$false`** Keep any text in the message body of incoming meeting requests. This is required to process external Teams and third-party meetings to provide One Touch Join experience.

- **DeleteSubject: `$false`** Keep the subject of incoming meeting requests.

- **ProcessExternalMeetingMessages: `$true`** Specifies whether to process meeting requests that originate outside the Exchange organization. Required for external Teams meetings and [third-party meetings](/microsoftteams/rooms/third-party-join).

- **RemovePrivateProperty: `$false`** Ensures the private flag that was sent by the meeting organizer in the original meeting request remains as specified.

- **AddAdditionalResponse: `$true`** The text specified by the AdditionalResponse parameter is added to meeting requests.

- **AdditionalResponse: "This is a Microsoft Teams Meeting room!"** The additional text to add to the meeting acceptance response.

To configure these properties, you need to connect to Exchange Online PowerShell. For more information, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true).

After you've connected to Exchange Online PowerShell, you can configure the mailbox properties on a resource account by using the [Set-CalendarProcessing](/powershell/module/exchange/mailboxes/set-calendarprocessing) cmdlet.

The following example sets the properties for the `ConferenceRoom01` resource account:

``` PowerShell
Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity "ConferenceRoom01" -AutomateProcessing AutoAccept -AddOrganizerToSubject $false -DeleteComments $false -DeleteSubject $false -ProcessExternalMeetingMessages $true -RemovePrivateProperty $false -AddAdditionalResponse $true -AdditionalResponse "This is a Microsoft Teams Meeting room!"
```
