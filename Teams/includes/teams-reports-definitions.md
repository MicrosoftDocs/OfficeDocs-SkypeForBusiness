## Definitions

The Teams reports show data for active users and active channels. For example, if a user in your organization isn't active in Teams during the date range that you specified for a report, data for that user isn't included in that report.  Some users will show in this report even when they have a value of zero for 1:1 calls, chat messages, replies, posts, channel messages, and meetings. This is due to other activity not counted as one of those metrics. An example is when a user clicks within the Teams client and reads a channel message but doesn't replyto it.
