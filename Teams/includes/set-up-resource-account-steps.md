In Microsoft Teams, a resource account is required for each auto attendant or call queue. Resource accounts may also be assigned telephone numbers. This is how you assign phone numbers to auto attendants and call queues allowing callers from outside Teams to reach the auto attendant or call queue.

This article covers how to create resource accounts and ready them for use with auto attendants and call queues.

Before you start the procedures in this article, ensure you've done the following steps:

- [Obtain Microsoft Teams Phone Resource Account licenses](#obtain-microsoft-teams-phone-resource-account-licenses)
- [Obtain phone numbers](#obtain-phone-numbers)

> [!NOTE]
> Resource accounts used for auto attendants and call queues are disabled for sign in and must remain so. Chat and presence are not available for these accounts.

### Obtain Microsoft Teams Phone Resource Account licenses

Each resource account requires a license in order to work with auto attendants and call queues, known as a **Microsoft Teams Phone Resource Account** license. Subscriptions with Teams Phone have access to a zero-cost allocation of **Microsoft Teams Phone Resource Account** licenses, and if more are needed, extra **Microsoft Teams Phone Resource Account** licenses can be purchased at a cost. For details on how to obtain these licenses, see [Microsoft Teams Phone Resource Account licenses](../teams-add-on-licensing/virtual-user.md).

We cover how to [assign the license to a resource account later in this article](#assign-a-license).

If you purchased **Teams Phone Standard**, **Teams Phone with Calling Plan**, or **Teams Shared Devices** licenses, you still need to complete the purchasing process for your allocation of **Teams Phone Resource Account** licenses, but your allotment of licenses will be zero cost at checkout.

To see if you already have **Teams Phone Resource Account** licenses in your tenant, sign into the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339) using an account with Global admin permissions. Then, go to [Billing > Your products](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/subscriptions). If you have **Teams Phone Resource Account** licenses, they'll appear as **Microsoft Teams Phone Resource Account**.

1. Open the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339) and sign in with a user that is a Global admin. This is usually the account you used to sign up for Microsoft 365.
1. In the left navigation pane, go to [**Billing** > **Purchase services**](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/catalog) > **Add-ons**.
1. Scroll to find the **Microsoft Teams Phone Resource Account** license.
1. Select the **Details** button.
1. Choose the number of licenses you want to purchase and a billing frequency.
    1. You need one license for each auto attendant and call queue you plan to set up. We recommend selecting at least five licenses so you can easily set up more auto attendants and call queues in the future without having to purchase more licenses right away.
1. Select the **Buy** button.
1. Fill in the purchasing details.
1. Confirm your order details, and then select the **Place order** button.

There's zero cost for your allotment of licenses, but you still need to follow these steps to acquire the licenses.

### Obtain phone numbers

Phone numbers are optional for auto attendants and call queues. For any auto attendant or call queue that you want to be reachable directly by a phone number, you must have a resource account with an associated phone number.

Resource accounts can use either toll or toll-free phone numbers. You can request new numbers or port existing numbers from another carrier.

Acceptable phone numbers that can be applied to resource accounts include:

- **Calling Plans service numbers:** To acquire service numbers with Calling Plans, see [Getting service phone numbers](../getting-service-phone-numbers.md).
- **Direct Routing numbers:** To acquire Direct Routing numbers, see [Enable users for Direct Routing](/microsoftteams/direct-routing-enable-users#configure-the-phone-number-and-enable-enterprise-voice).
- **Operator Connect numbers:** To acquire Operator Connect numbers, see [Configure Operator Connect](/microsoftteams/operator-connect-configure#set-up-phone-numbers).

To port a number from another carrier, see [Transfer phone numbers to Teams](../phone-number-calling-plans/transfer-phone-numbers-to-teams.md).
