<sup>1</sup> To [give and take control of shared content during sharing](../meeting-who-present-request-control.md), both parties must be using the Teams desktop client. Control isn't supported when either party is running Teams in a browser. This is due to a technical limitation that we're planning to fix.

<sup>2</sup> Teams meetings on browsers are limited to a single stream; either incoming video feed of the current speaker or screen sharing.

<sup>3</sup> Edge RS2 or later doesn't support sending real-time audio and video traffic through HTTP proxies.

<sup>4</sup> Classic Teams users may experience delayed chat messages, including one-on-one chats, group chats, or channel posts while using Safari Browser.

> [!NOTE]
> Running Teams in a browser is supported on PCs and Macs that meet the minimum [Hardware requirements for Microsoft Teams](../hardware-requirements-for-the-teams-app.md). For example, running Firefox on the Linux operating system is an option for using Teams.
>
> On mobile devices we recommend that you use the Teams app. The Teams app is available from the Android and iOS stores.
