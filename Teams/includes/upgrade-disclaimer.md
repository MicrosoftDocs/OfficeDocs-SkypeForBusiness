If you’re an admin on your Office 365 tenant, you may soon start seeing upgrade options in the Microsoft Teams admin message center. Having the option to upgrade doesn’t necessarily mean your organization is ready for this change. For the best user experience, confirm that Teams meets your collaboration and communication requirements, make sure that your network is ready to support Teams, and implement your user readiness plan before upgrading users to Teams.
