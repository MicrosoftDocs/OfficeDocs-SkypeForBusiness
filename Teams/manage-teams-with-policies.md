# Manage Teams with policies

Policies are an important part of managing Teams. Use this article to navigate how to use policies to benefit your organization.

## What you use policies for

Policies are used to accomplish many tasks in your organization across different areas such as messaging, meetings, and applications. Some of the things you can do include allowing users to schedule meetings in a teams channel, enabling users to edit sent messages, and controlling whether users can pin apps to the Teams app bar.

## How to assign policies

Policies can be assigned in several different ways depending on what your organization is trying to accomplish. You can make and view assignments in the Teams admin center.

Learn more about assigning policies [here](policy-assignment-overview.md).

## How to manage policies

Policies are managed with the Microsoft Teams admin center or [using PowerShell](./teams-powershell-managing-teams.md#manage-policies-via-powershell).

For example, an app setup policy can allow you to enable users to upload custom apps, install apps on behalf of your users, and pin apps to the Teams app bar. These policies are configured in the Teams admin center.

Additionally, a meeting policy can be used to control audio and video settings in Teams meetings such as transcriptions, cloud recordings, and IP audio/video.
