# Enable or disable sending emails when Audio Conferencing settings change in Microsoft Teams

Users are automatically notified by email when they're enabled for Audio Conferencing. There may be times, however, when you want to reduce the number of emails that are sent to Microsoft Teams users. In such cases, you can disable sending email.
  
If you disable sending emails, Audio Conferencing emails won't be sent to your users, including emails for when users are enabled or disabled for audio conferencing, when their PIN is reset, and when the conference ID and the default conferencing phone number changes.
  
Here's an example of the email that is sent to users when they're enabled for Audio Conferencing:

## When are emails being sent to your users?

- There are several emails that are sent to users in your organization after they're enabled for audio conferencing:

  - When an **Audio Conferencing** license is assigned to them.

  - When you manually reset the user's audio conferencing PIN.

  - When you manually reset the user's conference ID.

  - When the **Audio Conferencing** license is removed from them.

  - When the audio conferencing provider of a user is changed from Microsoft to another provider or **None**.

  - When the audio conferencing provider of a user is changed to Microsoft.

## Enable or disable email from being sent to users

You can use Microsoft Teams or Windows PowerShell to enable or disable email sent to users.

### Using the Microsoft Teams admin center

1. In the left navigation, go to **Meetings** > **Conference Bridges**.

2. At the top of the **Conference Bridges** page, select **Bridge settings**.

3. In the **Bridge settings** pane, enable or disable **Automatically send emails to users if their dial-in settings change**.

4. Select **Save**.

### Using Windows PowerShell

You can also use the Microsoft Teams PowerShell module and run:

```PowerShell
Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingTenantSettings -AutomaticallySendEmailsToUsers $true|$false
```

You can use the [Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingTenantSettings](/powershell/module/skype/set-csonlinedialinconferencingtenantsettings) to manage other settings for your organization, including email.

See the [Microsoft Teams PowerShell reference](/powershell/module/teams/?view=teams-ps) for more information.

Windows PowerShell is all about managing users and what users are allowed or not allowed to do. With Windows PowerShell, you can manage Microsoft 365 or Office 365 using a single point of administration that can simplify your daily work when you have multiple tasks to do.
