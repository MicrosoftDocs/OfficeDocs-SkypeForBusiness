# Enable or disable sending emails when Audio Conferencing settings change in Microsoft Teams

Users are automatically notified by email when they are enabled for Audio Conferencing. There may be times, however, when you want to reduce the number of emails that are sent to Microsoft Teams users. In such cases, you can disable sending email.
  
If you disable sending emails, Audio Conferencing emails won't be sent to your users, including emails for when users are enabled or disabled for audio conferencing, when their PIN is reset, and when the conference ID and the default conferencing phone number changes.
  
Here is an example of the email that is sent to users when they are enabled for Audio Conferencing:

## When are emails being sent to your users?

- There are several emails that are sent to users in your organization after they are enabled for audio conferencing:
    
  - When an **Audio Conferencing** license is assigned to them.
    
  - When you manually reset the user's audio conferencing PIN.
    
  - When you manually reset the user's conference ID.
    
  - When the **Audio Conferencing** license is removed from them.
    
  - When the audio conferencing provider of a user is changed from Microsoft to another provider or **None**.
    
  - When the audio conferencing provider of a user is changed to Microsoft.


## Enable or disable email from being sent to users
