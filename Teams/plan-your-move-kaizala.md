# Planning for a successful move from Kaizala to Microsoft Teams

> [!Important]
> Microsoft Kaizala has retired on August 31, 2023. We recommend using Microsoft Teams for continued connection, sharing, and collaboration.

As you embark on your move from Kaizala to Microsoft Teams, it's important to take the time to [plan](/microsoftteams/deploy-enterprise-setup?tabs=ChatTeamsChannels#plan-your-deployment) for a successful transition. A solid transition plan gives you structure for your move and ensures that all stakeholders are working towards a common goal. Using a proven framework to implement the change can help you get started on your transition today.

## Framework for your move

![Screenshot that depicts move guidance.](media/plan-for-successful-transition.png)

We’ve outlined our recommended approach to a successful transition (in the following sections which are phases) and encourage you to follow the phases in order, as each step in the framework builds upon the step prior.

- Envisioning teamwork for your organization

- Identifying champions and critical stakeholders

- Defining your project scope

- Piloting Microsoft Teams

Before getting started, ensure that:

- [Teams is installed](/microsoftteams/get-clients) and [licenses are assigned](/office365/servicedescriptions/teams-service-description) in your environment. At least minimum licenses should be assigned to your core team and to the early adopters who will participate in this initial project phase.

- You've downloaded the desktop and mobile applications.

### Envision teamwork for your organization

A healthy technical environment, sustained user adoption, and the realization of your business goals all begin with proper planning. A solid plan gives you a framework for your upgrade project and ensures that all stakeholders are working towards the same goals. Take time to list the current scenarios in which Kaizala is used. Next, envision usage scenarios above and beyond in modern workplace with Microsoft Teams. To get started with defining usage scenarios, see [Define usage scenarios for Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/teams-adoption-define-usage-scenarios).

### Identify champions and critical stakeholders

Begin by bringing together the right stakeholders and define your upgrade plan. A proper plan should include your scope, goals, and a clear timeline for transition. With an agreed plan in place, confirm that your technical environment and your end users are ready for Teams. Identify people who are interested in new technology and in helping others. Create a [champion program](/microsoftteams/teams-adoption-create-champions-program) to drive excitement, awareness, and adoption across your transition. We’ve created a Champions Program Guide to kickstart this program in your organization; for more information, see [Build a champion program](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://fto365dev.blob.core.windows.net:443/media/Default/DocResources/Adoption/Build_Champions_Program_Guide.pptx).

### Define your project scope

As you plan for your move to Microsoft Teams, it's critical to define what success looks like for your business. The project scope defines the focus of your project at this time and serves to keep your project team focused on their current tasks, enabling you to realize your long-term vision.

For more information about our recommended strategy for defining outcomes and success, see [Define outcomes and success for adopting Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/teams-adoption-define-outcomes).

### Pilot Microsoft Teams

Once you’ve defined your project scope and vision, it’s time to pilot Microsoft Teams. Identify a user group of [early adopters](/microsoftteams/teams-adoption-onboard-early-adopters) to participate in an initial experiment with Teams. Conducting your pilot includes communicating with your users, monitoring your network and usage to ensure your network performance and call quality remain healthy, gathering feedback from participants, and reviewing help desk tickets for questions related to Teams.

## Prepare your organization

After following the recommended framework for planning a successful transition from Kaizala, prepare your organization for a successful transition of Microsoft Teams.

### Get ready

 1. Ensure that there are Teams licenses for everybody. Check out [Teams plans](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/compare-microsoft-teams-options?activetab=pivot%3aprimaryr1) and [Microsoft Teams service description](/office365/servicedescriptions/teams-service-description).

 2. Use [Microsoft Teams Adoption](https://adoption.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/#get-started) guidance to roll out Teams across your organization.

 3. Prepare administrators, champions, and your greater organization to embrace communication with Teams through skilling and adoption resources.  

 4. Use the following training resources to help users in your organization learn and get the most out of Teams:

    - **IT Admin readiness**: For more information, see [Admin training resources](/microsoftteams/itadmin-readiness).
