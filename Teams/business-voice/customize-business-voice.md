# Customize Microsoft 365 Teams Phone with Calling Plan

The [Teams Phone with Calling Plan setup guide](set-up-overview.md) sets up Teams Phone with Calling Plan with basic options so you can use it right away. Those options might be enough if you're a small business just starting out or if you're running a pilot in your larger organization. You get the basics with new phone numbers and a call menu.

But you'll likely want to customize Teams Phone with Calling Plan to better meet your business needs. For example, you'll probably want to move your existing phone numbers (called number porting) to Teams Phone with Calling Plan.
