# Customize Teams Phone System with Calling Plan

The [Teams Phone System with Calling Plan setup guide](set-up-overview.md) gets the Phone System with Calling Plan bundle started with basic options so you can use it right away. Those options might be enough if you're a small business just starting out or if you're running a pilot in your larger organization. You get the basics with new phone numbers and a call menu.

But you'll likely want to customize Phone System with Calling Plan to better meet your business needs. For example, you'll probably want to move your existing phone numbers (called number porting) to Phone System with Calling Plan.

| Task        | Description       |
|-------------|-------------------|
| [Move phone numbers to Phone System with Calling Plan](port-phone-numbers.md) | Bring your existing phone numbers to Phone System with Calling Plan. |
| [Set up calling policies](set-up-policies.md) | Control whether users can do things like make private calls, use call forwarding, and delegate calls. |
| [Create additional users](create-users.md) | Add more users and assign new or existing phone numbers to them. |
| [Set up call queues](./create-a-phone-system-call-queue-smb.md) | Create a queue where callers can wait for the next available agent. |
