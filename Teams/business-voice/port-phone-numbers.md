Earlier in this setup guide, you acquired phone numbers for the main company line and for any users that you've assigned a Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle license to. **If you're a new business and don't have any existing phone numbers that you want to bring to Phone System with Calling Plan, you can skip this step.**

If you already have phone numbers that you want to keep when you move to Phone System with Calling Plan, you can bring them with you by using a process called phone number porting to bring them over to Phone System with Calling Plan. After you port your phone numbers to Phone System with Calling Plan, you assign them to users and services. The old numbers replace the temporary numbers that you acquired earlier in this setup guide.

Before you move numbers to Phone System with Calling Plan, take a look at [Transferring phone numbers common questions](../phone-number-calling-plans/port-order-overview.md). This article includes answers to questions including what countries and regions are supported, what numbers can and can't be transferred, and what information you'll need.

When you're ready to move your phone numbers to Phone System with Calling Plan, follow the steps in [Transfer phone numbers to Microsoft Teams](../phone-number-calling-plans/transfer-phone-numbers-to-teams.md) to create a port order. The order includes the information that's needed to move your numbers from your current phone service carrier to Phone System with Calling Plan.

After your phone numbers have been moved to Phone System with Calling Plan, you need to assign them to people. To do that, follow the steps in [Change a phone number for a user](../assign-change-or-remove-a-phone-number-for-a-user.md#change-a-phone-number-for-a-user). When you follow these steps, you'll replace the phone number that was temporarily assigned to the user with their original phone number that you ported over.
