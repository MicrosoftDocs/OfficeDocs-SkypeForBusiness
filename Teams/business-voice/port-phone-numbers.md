# Move (port) phone numbers to Business Voice

When the Getting Started wizard helps you set up Business Voice, it assigns phone numbers for the main company line and for any users that you've assigned a Business Voice license to. If you want to keep using your pre-existing phone numbers, you can use *phone number porting* to bring them over to Business voice. After "port" your phone numbers to Business Voice, you assign them to users and services. The old numbers replace the temporary numbers that the Getting Started wizard assigned.

Before you move numbers to Business Voice, take a look at [Transferring phone numbers common questions](../transferring-phone-numbers-common-questions.md). This article provides fundamental information like what countries and regions are supported, what numbers can and can't be transferred, and what information you'll need.

When you're ready to move your phone numbers to Business Voice, follow the steps in [Transfer phone numbers to Office 365](../transfer-phone-numbers-to-office-365.md) to create a port order. The order includes the information that's needed to move your numbers from your current phone service carrier to Business Voice.

After your phone numbers have been moved to Business Voice, you reassign them to people. To do that, follow the steps in [Change a phone number for a user](../assign-change-or-remove-a-phone-number-for-a-user.md#change-a-phone-number-for-a-user). This procedure replaces the phone number that was temporarily assigned to the user with their original phone number that you ported over.

If you need help porting your numbers to Business Voice, send us a request. Be sure to include the following information:
- Your organization ID (such as ***contoso***.onmicrosoft.com)

- The authorizing person on your account
- A description of the issue or question that you have
