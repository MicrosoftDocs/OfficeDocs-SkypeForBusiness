## Before you start

If you already have phone numbers that you want to keep when you move to Phone System with Calling Plan, you can bring them with you by using a process called phone number porting to bring them over to Phone System with Calling Plan. After you port your phone numbers to Phone System with Calling Plan, you assign them to users and services. The old numbers replace the temporary numbers that you acquired earlier in this setup guide.
