# Set up the Teams Phone System with Calling Plan bundle for small to medium businesses

The Teams Phone System with Calling Plan bundle is a complete phone system that can replace your existing telephony provider. Whether you're a new business setting up phone numbers for the first time or an established business moving from a legacy on-premises telephony provider, the steps in these articles can help you get up and running with the Phone System with Calling Plan bundle. When you're finished setting up:

* You'll be able to receive toll or toll-free phone calls on a main company phone line. You can even set up a call menu if you want.
* Users set up with a Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle license will have their own direct-dial phone numbers that they can use to make and receive phone calls from any device with Teams installed.
* Meeting participants will be able to call in to meetings using a regular phone if they're unable to join from a Teams client.
* If you have existing phone numbers, you'll be able to continue using them after they're moved to Phone System with Calling Plan.
