# What's the difference between Business Voice and Enterprise Voice?

Microsoft 365 Business Voice and Enterprise Voice in Microsoft Teams provide the same services to both small business and Enterprise users. Both services provide cloud-based phone systems with Phone System, domestic and international calling options, and audio conferencing.

While Business Voice and Enterprise Voice offer the same services, there are a few important differences:

- **Maximum number of licenses** - You can purchase up to 300 Business Voice licenses. With Enterprise Voice, you can purchase an unlimited number of licenses.
- **Simplicity** - Business Voice gives you everything you need to get Phone System up and running; you don't need to worry about which licenses each user needs. With Enterprise Voice, however, you can be more selective about which users are assigned licenses like audio conferencing.

Business Voice licenses are available for the first 300 users in your organization. If your organization grows beyond 300 users, you need to purchase Enterprise Voice licenses for those additional users. You don't need to switch your original 300 users from Business Voice to Enterprise Voice. Both licenses can exist in an organization at the same time. However, only one license, either Business Voice or Enterprise Voice, can be assigned to an individual user. You can't assign both licenses to a single user.
