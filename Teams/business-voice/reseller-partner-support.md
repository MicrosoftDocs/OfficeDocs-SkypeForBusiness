# Get help from a Microsoft reseller or partner

You can set up Teams Phone System yourself or use a Microsoft partner or seller.

You can find a Microsoft reseller or partner by visiting the [Connect with partners](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/partner-dir) page.

A Microsoft partner or reseller can:

- Obtain the correct Teams Phone licenses for your tenant and phone users
- Help you understand the technical requirements for setting up Phone System
- Coordinate with your telephone provider to make sure your phone numbers are properly set up for use with Phone System
- Set up communication between your on-premises telephony hardware and Microsoft 365
- Help you set up Phone System capabilities like Call Queues, Auto Attendant, Voice Mail, and more

When contacting a Microsoft partner or reseller about setting up Teams Phone System, you'll need to provide them with information such as:

- How many users, phones, and other devices, will need to make and receive calls to and from external phone numbers
- Details about your existing phone system
- Details about your connection between your Teams Phone System and your PSTN provider
- Your Internet connection
- Unique design considerations about your organization such as the need to support call centers, phone system call menus (for example, press 1 for Sales, press 2 for Technical Support), conference rooms, phone kiosks, and so on.
- How many locations your existing phone system supports and how connectivity is set up between them
