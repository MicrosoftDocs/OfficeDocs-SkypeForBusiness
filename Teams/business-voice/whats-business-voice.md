## Who in my organization needs to be assigned Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle licenses?

You need to assign Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle license to any user who needs to make or receive phone calls to external phone numbers.

Users who don't need to make or receive phone calls to or from external phone numbers just need a Teams license.

For example, you might have ten factory employees and five office employees. The factory employees may only need to call other employees within your company. In addition to calling other employees, office workers need to make and receive phone calls to and from suppliers, partners, and customers. In this case, only the five office workers need Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle licenses.
