# What is Microsoft 365 Business Voice?

Microsoft 365 Business Voice turns Microsoft Teams into a powerful, flexible telephone system for small and medium-sized organizations. It's a replacement for traditional telephony providers and in-house phone systems, which can be difficult and costly to manage. With Business Voice, you can set up toll and toll-free numbers, menus to direct callers to the right department, audio conferencing to host meetings, and more. You can also give your staff their own phone numbers so they can get calls directly.

Business Voice does all of this by wrapping Microsoft 365 Phone System features into an easy-to-manage bundle. You don't need to worry about choosing the right plan or feature; they're all there and set up for you. Because the phone system is a part of Teams, you can turn any PC, Mac, or mobile device into a phone that can use your Business Voice phone number.

Business Voice is right for you if your organization has 300 or fewer people and you have one the following Microsoft 365 subscriptions:

* Office 365 Business Essentials
* Office 365 Business Premium
* Office 365 E1
* Office 365 E3
* Office 365 F1
* Microsoft 365 A1
* Microsoft 365 A3
* Microsoft 365 E3
* Microsoft 365 Business

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Business Voice is currently available in Canada and the United Kingdom. More countries and regions will become available in 2020.
>
> Microsoft Teams and Business Voice only work when your users' mailboxes are located in Microsoft 365.  They don't support mailboxes located on on-premises Exchange Server.

When you buy Business Voice, you get the following features and more:
