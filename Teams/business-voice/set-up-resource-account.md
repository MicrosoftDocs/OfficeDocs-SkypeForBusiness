# Step 4: Set up a Teams Phone System resource account

Resource accounts aren't assigned to any specific user. Instead, resource accounts, which use a free virtual user license, are used by devices and services in Microsoft 365. In Microsoft Teams, resource accounts are assigned phone numbers and are then associated with auto attendants and call queues.

By associating resource accounts to auto attendants and call queues, you can add one or more toll or toll-free phone numbers to them. For example, you could associate one resource account with a toll number to an auto attendant for local callers. For long distance calls, you could associate another resource account with a toll-free number to the same auto attendant.

The sections in this article show you how to set up a resource account and then assign a phone number to it. Later on, you'll associate the resource account with an auto attendant.

## Obtain virtual user licenses

Resource accounts require a license in order to work with auto attendants and call queues. You can use a free *Microsoft Teams Phone Standard - Virtual User* license.

> [!NOTE]
> You should only need to perform the following steps if you've signed up for a Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle license trial period. If you purchased Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle licenses, virtual licenses should already be applied to your account.
>
> To see if you already have virtual licenses, log into Microsoft 365 using an account with Global admin permissions. Then go to Billing > [Your products](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/subscriptions). If you have virtual licenses, they'll appear as **Microsoft Teams Phone Standard - Virtual User**.

1. Open the Microsoft 365 admin center and log in with a user that is a Global admin. This is usually the account you used to sign up for Microsoft 365.
2. In the left navigation pane, go to <a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/catalog" target="_blank">**Billing** > **Purchase services**</a> > **Add-ons** > **See all Add-ons products**.
3. Scroll to the end to find the **Microsoft Teams Phone Standard â€“ Virtual User** license. Select **Details**, then **Buy**.
4. On the license purchase page, select the number of virtual user licenses you want. You need one virtual license for each auto attendant and call queue you plan to set up. We recommend selecting at least five licenses so you can easily set up more auto attendants and call queues in the future without having to purchase more licenses right away.
5. Uncheck **Automatically assign to all of your users with no licenses**.
6. Select **Check out now**.
7. Confirm your order, select **Next**, and then **Place order**.

> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind you must still  **Buy** the license even though it has a cost of zero.

## Create a resource account

After you've received your *Microsoft Teams Phone Standard - Virtual User* license, you can create your resource account.

1. Open the Microsoft Teams admin center and log in with a user that is a Global admin (this is usually the account you used to sign up for Microsoft 365).
2. In the left navigation pane, go to <a href="https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/company-wide-settings/resource-accounts" target="_blank">**Voice** > **Resource accounts**</a>.
3. Select **Add**.
4. In the **Add resource account** pane, fill out **Display name**, and then **Username**. Choose a descriptive display name such as "Main line auto attendant" to describe the purpose of the resource account.
5. In **Resource account type**, select **Auto attendant**.
6. Select **Save**.

## Assign a license

After you've created your resource account, you need to assign a *Microsoft Teams Phone Standard - Virtual User* license or *Teams Phone Standard* license.

1. Open the Microsoft 365 admin center and log in with a user that is a Global admin. This is usually the account you used to sign up for Microsoft 365.
1. In the left navigation pane, go to <a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/users" target="_blank">**Users** > **Active users**</a>.
1. Select your resource account.
