# Upgrade users from the Teams Exploratory trial

This article provides an overview of how to upgrade your users from a Teams Exploratory trial to paid Teams licenses.

- [Step 1: When to upgrade](#step-1-when-to-upgrade)

- [Step 2: Choose an upgrade path](#step-2-choose-an-upgrade-path)

- [Step 3: Assign paid licenses](#step-3-assign-paid-licenses)

## Step 1: When to upgrade  

To check when your organization’s Teams Exploratory trial is expiring and how many active users it has, go to **Billing >** <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank"><b>Your products</b></a> in the Microsoft 365 admin center. You’ll also be notified before the Teams Exploratory trial expires.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should make a plan to upgrade your users to paid licenses before the expiration date, so users don’t lose access to Teams.
>
> Users will lose access to Teams 30 days after the trial's expiration date. As long as users are assigned a paid license within 60 days of the expiration date, they can regain access to Teams and all content still exists. However, after 60 days, the users’ data is deleted. After a new license is assigned to the users to enable Teams functionality, if they are added within the grace period time frame, all content remains. For more information, see <a href="/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/what-if-my-subscription-expires?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank">What happens to my data and access when my subscription ends?</a>

## Step 2: Choose an upgrade path

> [!TIP]
> We recommend Teams Essentials as the primary option for customers looking to upgrade their expiring Teams Exploratory trials. For more information, see [Compare Microsoft Teams Essentials to other plans](get-started-with-teams-essentials.md#how-does-microsoft-teams-essentials-compare-to-other-microsoft-teams-plans).

Depending on the subscriptions your organization currently has, there are three ways to upgrade from a Microsoft Teams Exploratory trial to a paid license:

- **Upgrade an existing Microsoft 365 subscription.** Use this option if your organization has subscriptions to other Office products that don’t include Teams. For more information, see <a href="/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/upgrade-to-different-plan?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank">Upgrade to a different business plan</a>. To see active users for an existing subscription, go to **Users >** <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834822" target="_blank"><b>Active users</b></a> in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

- **Add users to an existing Microsoft 365 subscription.** Use this option if your organization doesn’t have enough paid Teams licenses to cover the Teams Exploratory users. For more information, see <a href="/microsoft-365/commerce/licenses/buy-licenses?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank">Buy or remove licenses</a>. To add users to an existing subscription that already has enough available licenses, see <a href="/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/move-users-different-subscription?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank">Move users to a different subscription</a>. To see active users for an existing subscription, go to **Users >** <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834822" target="_blank"><b>Active users</b></a> in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

- **Buy a new Microsoft 365 subscription.** Use this option if your organization doesn’t have any existing subscriptions to Office products, or if your organization wants to buy a subscription that’s different from their existing subscription to cover Teams Exploratory users.  For more information, see <a href="/microsoft-365/commerce/try-or-buy-microsoft-365?view=o365-worldwide%22%20\#buy-a-different-subscription" target="_blank">Buy a different Microsoft 365 for business subscription</a>.

If you’re not sure which Microsoft 365 subscription to upgrade to, see <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business#coreui-heading-hiatrep" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 for Business</a>. If you need additional help choosing a subscription, or if your organization needs more than 300 licenses, contact your <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/solution-providers/home" target="_blank">Microsoft partner</a> or Microsoft account representative.

## Step 3: Assign paid licenses

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you unassign any Teams Exploratory licenses, assign the new licenses to all the users you’re upgrading. Otherwise, they lose access to Teams until you assign a paid license.  

To assign your newly acquired licenses, see <a href="/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users?view=o365-worldwide&viewFallbackFrom=o365-worldwide%22%20%5C" target="_blank">Assign licenses to users</a>.  

After you assign the new licenses, unassign the Teams Exploratory licenses. See <a href="/microsoft-365/admin/manage/remove-licenses-from-users?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank">Unassign licenses from users</a>, for more information.

### Auto-claim policies

Next time you upgrade, use auto-claim policies to create policies for your organization to automatically assign licenses from paid subscriptions to new users who haven’t acquired a Teams license. For more information, see <a href="/microsoft-365/commerce/licenses/manage-auto-claim-policies?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank">Manage auto-claim policies</a>.
