# See a list of telephone numbers 

There are different types of telephone numbers that you can assign to users or voice applications like [Audio Conferencing](deploy-audio-conferencing-teams-landing-page.md) or [Call Queues](plan-auto-attendant-call-queue.md). For more information, see [Manage telephone numbers for your organization](/microsoftteams/manage-phone-numbers-landing-page).

This article applies to Calling Plans, Operator Connect, and Teams Phone Mobile. For information about Direct Routing, see [Configure the telephone number and enable enterprise voice](direct-routing-enable-users.md#configure-the-phone-number-and-enable-enterprise-voice).
  
## To see telephone numbers in your organization

To see the telephone numbers in your organization:

1. Go to the **Microsoft Teams admin center**.

2. In the left navigation, go to **Voice** > **Phone numbers**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > For you to see the **Voice** option in the left navigation in the Microsoft Teams admin center, you must first buy at least one **Enterprise E5 license**, one **Teams Phone** add-on license, or one **Audio Conferencing** add-on license.

3. To view the assignment status of a number, see the **Assignment Status** column, which also shows what type of service the number is assigned to. You can click the filter icon to filter by:

   - **Assigned to user**
   - **Assigned to conference bridge** 
   - **Assigned to Voice app (Auto Attendant/Call Queue)**
   - **Unassigned**

4. On the **Filter** pane, you can use the drop-down list to filter your view by:

   - **Number range** that you set. You can search by lowest number or highest number.
   - Numbers that start with a number that you specify.
   - Number **activation state**.
   - Number **type**.
   - Phone number **status**.



## To see the activation status for number assignments

After you've gotten your telephone numbers and assigned them to users, you might want to see the activation status of the number assignments:
  
1. Go to the **Microsoft Teams admin center**.

2. In the left navigation, go to **Voice** > **Phone numbers**.

3. Click the filter icon to filter your view by **Activation state**. You can filter by:

   - **Activated**
   - **Assignment pending**
   - **Assignment failed**
   - **Update pending**
   - **Update failed**

## Using the Teams PowerShell module

You can also use the Teams PowerShell module version 1.1.6 or later to see the phone numbers in your organizaation. For more information about PowerShell, see [Microsoft Teams PowerShell Overview](teams-powershell-overview.md).

To see a list of all telephone numbers that you have for your organization, use the [Get-CsPhoneNumberAssignment](/powershell/module/teams/get-csphonenumberassignment) cmdlet. For example, to see each telephone number, its type, and its state, run the following command:

```PowerShell
Get-CsPhoneNumberAssignment | ft TelephoneNumber,ActivationState,NumberType
```

To see all of the telephone numbers that are assigned to users, use the [Get-CsOnlineUser](/powershell/module/skype/get-csonlineuser) cmdlet. For example, to see all users with a telephone number assigned, run the following command:

```PowerShell
Get-CsOnlineUser | Where-Object  { $_.LineURI -notlike $null } | ft DisplayName,UserPrincipalName,LineURI
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, the [Get-CsPhoneNumberAssignment](/powershell/module/teams/get-csphonenumberassignment) cmdlet returns the first 500 results.
