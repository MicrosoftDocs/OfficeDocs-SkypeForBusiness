# Upgrading your users from Skype for Business Online to Microsoft Teams

> [!Note]
> The commands described in this article are designed to be used as part of the [Upgrade Basic](https://aka.ms/UpgradeBasic) checklist.

The technical migration aspects of your upgrade entail notifying your users that Skype for Business will be upgrading to Teams and then moving them to a **Teams only** mode. These steps can be accomplished via a Skype for Business remote Windows PowerShell session or through the Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business Admin Center. 
 
We're actively rolling out upgrade tooling in the [Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business Admin Center](manage-teams-skypeforbusiness-admin-center.md), and it should be available soon on your tenant. As soon as it's available, you can find information about migrating your users in [Setting your coexistence and upgrade settings](https://aka.ms/SkypeToTeams-SetCoexistence). 
 
If you're ready to upgrade today, you can use the [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/enterprise/powershell/manage-office-365-with-office-365-powershell) commands listed in the following table.
