# IT Admins - Microsoft Teams deployment overview

> [!TIP]
> Are you looking for information on how to install the Teams client on your PC or mobile device? Go here: [Download Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app).

There are several options for setting up Teams. To help you find the information you need, we've split up some articles into two audiences: [**Small business**](deploy-small-business.md) (fewer than 50 users) and [**Medium/large business**](deploy-enterprise-overview.md) (more than 50 users).

> [!TIP]
> As a companion to this article, we recommend using the [Microsoft Teams automated setup guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224815) when signed in to the Microsoft 365 admin center. This guide will customize your experience based on your environment. To review best practices without signing in and activating automated setup features, go to the [Microsoft 365 setup portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2222975).

## Start with a pilot rollout

If you're a larger organization, pilot Teams with a small group of early adopters so you can learn about Teams and start planning your org-wide deployment. Later, use the guidance on the [Microsoft Teams Adoption](https://adoption.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams) site to help you roll out Teams across your organization.

We recommend rolling out Teams in stages, workload by workload, as your organization is ready. You don't have to wait until you've completed one step before you move to the next. Some organizations might want to roll out all Teams features at once, while others might prefer a phased approach. Here are the Teams workloads, in the order we recommend rolling them out:

- [Chat, teams, channels, & apps](deploy-chat-teams-channels-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md)
- [Meetings, webinars, and town halls](overview-meetings-webinars-town-halls.md)
- [Audio conferencing](audio-conferencing-in-office-365.md)
- [Cloud voice](cloud-voice-landing-page.md)

If you have a medium or large organization, [use Advisor for Teams to help you roll out Microsoft Teams](use-advisor-teams-roll-out.md) to help you plan the rollout of these workloads across your organization. The Advisor uses Teams itself to create planning tasks and assign them to owners, share documents, and enable discussions amongst your deployment team.

## Upgrade or migrate from Skype for Business Server

If you're coming to Teams from Skype for Business Server, or if you need a hybrid configuration, you still want to follow the recommended path above for a Teams deployment, but first you need to do some extra planning. Start by reviewing the guidance in the table below that applies to your organization's profile.

|Your organization's profile|Guidance  |
|---------|---------|
|My organization is running Skype for Business Server, and I want to roll out Teams. |For a full-scale Teams rollout, first you need to configure hybrid connectivity between your on-premises environment and Microsoft 365. Start by reading [Plan hybrid connectivity between Skype for Business Server and Microsoft 365 or Office 365](/skypeforbusiness/hybrid/plan-hybrid-connectivity). <br><br>You should also review [Upgrade to Teams](upgrade-start-here.md).   |
|I don't have Skype for Business Server, but I do have an on-premises Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) solution. I want to roll out Teams, but I want to keep my on-premises PSTN solution. |Roll out Teams following  the suggestions in this article.<br><br>Then read [Plan Direct Routing](direct-routing-plan.md) to learn about using Phone System Direct Routing to hook up your on-premises PSTN solution with Teams.|
