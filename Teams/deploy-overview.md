# Microsoft Teams deployment overview

> [!TIP]

Hi! Thanks for choosing Microsoft Teams. Whether you're a five-person law firm, or a large multi-national distributor, Teams can help bring your organization together via chats, voice calling, video conferences, file sharing, and more. And no matter whether you're just getting into collaboration tools for the first time, or if you're upgrading to Teams from Microsoft Skype for Business, we can help you get up and running.

Because Teams supports such a wide array of organization types and starting points, there are several options for setting it up. To help you find the information you need, we've split up some articles into two audiences: **Small business** (fewer than 50 users) and **Medium/large business** (more than 50 users). When reading an article, choose the audience tab that best matches your organization. Here are what the tabs look like:

The following is a list of sections you can choose from in the **Get started** section and a short description of each.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have an existing Skype for Business Online or on-premises Skype for Business deployment, check out the following topics in addition to those in the **Get started** section.

|---------|---------|
|[Quick start](get-started-with-teams-quick-start.md)     | The **Quick start** section introduces you to Teams in your own organization. You can start using features like teams, chats, file sharing, and more. <br>If you're a small business, this might be all you need to roll out Teams to your employees. <br>For larger businesses, use this section to start a pilot amongst your information technology group so you can get familiar with Teams.        |
|[Small business setup](deploy-small-business.md)| The **Small business setup** section guides smaller businesses through setting up Teams.

|[Enterprise setup](deploy-enterprise-overview.md)     | The **Enterprise setup** section guides larger business through setting up Teams in situations where network planning, lifecycle management, and wide-scale adoption, are critical factors to successful deployment. This section also helps you understand the requirements for audio and video conferencing, and configuring Phone System and PSTN connectivity.         |
|[Deploy Team clients](get-clients.md)     | The **Deploy Teams clients** section provides instructions for setting up the Teams client on PC, mobile, and other devices. It also includes information on how larger business can deploy Teams across your organization and what URLs and IP addresses should be opened on your firewalls.       |
|[Teams training](training-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md)     | The **Teams training** section provides training materials for end-users who use the Teams clients, and also for organization admins who need to manage Teams across your organization.        |
