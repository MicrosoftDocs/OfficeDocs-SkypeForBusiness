# Configure Quality of Service (QoS) settings in the Teams admin center

<a name="bknetwork"> </a>

This article is for administrators and IT professionals who are configuring Quality of Service for Microsoft Teams. This article describes how to enable QoS in the Teams admin center.

**Before reading this article, be sure to read [Implement Quality of Service in Microsoft Teams](qos-in-teams.md)**, which describes everything you need to know to successfully use QoS with Microsoft Teams:

- QoS concepts, such as QoS queues, DSCP, DSCP markers and tagging, and so on
- Network readiness considerations
- Choosing a QoS implementation method
- Choosing port ranges
- Validating your implementation

Note: If you enable QoS or change settings in the Microsoft Teams admin center for the Teams service, you'll also need to [apply matching settings to all user devices](QoS-in-Teams-clients.md) and all internal network devices to fully implement the changes to QoS in Teams.

## Manage QoS markers in the Microsoft Teams admin center

1. Go to the [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com).
2. In the left navigation, go to **Meetings** > **Meeting settings**.
3. Under **Network**, do the following:

    - To enable QoS, turn on **Quality of Service (QoS) markers for real-time media traffic**. You can specify whether or not to use markers, but you can't set custom markers for each traffic type. For more information about DSCP markers, see [Select a QoS implementation method](QoS-in-Teams.md#step-2-select-a-qos-implementation-method).

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > Enabling QoS is performed only on the endpoints for tagging packets leaving the client. We recommend applying matching QoS rules on all internal network devices for incoming traffic.

    - If you've enabled Quality of Service, you must manage your port settings. 
    
      To specify port ranges, next to **Select a port range for each type of real-time media traffic**, select  **Specify port ranges**, and then enter the starting and ending ports for audio, video, and screen sharing. 
      
      Selecting a port range that is too narrow will lead to dropped calls and poor call quality. For more information about choosing port ranges, see [Choose initial port ranges](qos-in-teams.md#step-3-choose-initial-port-ranges-for-each-media-type).

      The port ranges you assign can't overlap and should be adjacent to each other.

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > Do not select **Automatically use any available ports** unless you aren't implementing QoS. If you select this option, available ports between 1024 and 65535 are used. 

After using QoS for a while, you can use use [Call Quality Dashboard](cqd-what-is-call-quality-dashboard.md) to determine if changes are required to your QoS configuration.
