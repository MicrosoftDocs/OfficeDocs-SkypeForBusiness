# About the upgrade framework

To help take the guesswork out of your upgrade journey, we’ve employed a proven framework for implementing change. As illustrated below, each step in the framework builds on the step prior and, for optimal results, we recommend following the steps in order.  

Begin by bringing together the right stakeholders and defining your upgrade plan (eg. scope, goals and timeline). With a plan in place, confirm your technical environment and your end-users are ready for Teams. Then, implement your upgrade in stages, moving from a pilot to an organization-wide upgrade when ready. Once your organization is on Teams, establish an operational plan that monitors for quality and accelerates user adoption.

Confirm both technical and user readiness. Execute your rollout plan. Maintain momentum to maximize results.")

Look for this framework graphic on related pages to identify where you are in the upgrade process.

## Sample upgrade timeline

Your upgrade journey begins when you start planning for the change. Leveraging the success framework as a guideline, below is a sample timeline that take you from the pre-upgrade phase where you will plan and prepare for your upgrade, through the upgrade and into the post-upgrade operational phase, designed to sustain and amplify your outcomes. 

> [!NOTE]
> We understand that your journey to Teams might involve leveraging multiple [modes](https://aka.ms/skypetoteams-coexist) and upgrading groups of users at different times, which will enable you to control the user upgrade experience while maintaining momentum with Teams.  

To help demonstrate how your upgrade journey might unfold, we’ve provided a sample plan below that defines a journey going from Skype for Business Online to Islands mode to Teams only. In addition, the sample plan outlines an organization that has divided their users into four upgrade groups, or cohorts. Using this as a template, customize the plan to encompass your specific journey to Teams, incorporating the various [modes](https://aka.ms/skypetoteams-coexist) you’ll use and the number of upgrade groups you’ll segment your users into. 

## Pre-upgrade

**Prepare your organization for Teams**. To help ensure a successful upgrade to Teams, it’s important to allocate adequate time for preparation. Not only will your organization be able to quickly start realizing the value of Teams, you’ll be able to accelerate your upgrade from Skype for Business as soon as Teams is ready for you. If you’ve already enabled Teams alongside Skype for Business, use these pre-upgrade activities as a checkpoint to validate your organization’s readiness before you upgrade users to Teams. 

> [!TIP]
> Download the [Upgrade Success Kit](https://aka.ms/UpgradeSuccessKit) for template user readiness materials, such as communications and user surveys, in addition to a sample upgrade project plan and pilot test plan. Items that are available in the kit are marked with an asterisk (*) in the lists below.

## Upgrade 

**Make the official move to Teams**. When you upgrade your users, you move them into Teams only  mode. Teams becomes their primary app for chat, meetings, calling, and collaboration, and access to the Skype for Business app is disabled. Although the technical aspects of this phase are quite simple, consider the effect the change might have on user experience and allow time for users to officially transition their activities from Skype for Business to Teams. To reduce users’ having different experiences with different clients, try to limit the end-to-end upgrade window to 45 days or so.
