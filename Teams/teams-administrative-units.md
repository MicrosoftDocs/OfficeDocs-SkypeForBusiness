# Administrative units for Microsoft Teams

This article describes the highlights of Administrative Units for Teams administration using the Teams admin center and the Teams PowerShell module. Administrative Units are a way to delegate administrative tasks to a subset of users, groups, or devices using the Microsoft Entra Admin Portal.

You could previously manage Devices via Administrative Units, but only for the Teams Administrator role, as outlined in this article: [Manage devices with administrative units](administrative-unit.md).

With more capabilities enabled to be managed via Administrative Units, there's a need to cover the following usages:

## Set up Administrative Units

### Scenario One: Creation of Administrative Units in the Microsoft Entra admin center (AAD)

Full details on how to create Administrative Units can be found here (Administrative Unit administrators need a Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 license): [Create or delete Administrative Units - Entra ID](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/admin-units-manage?tabs=ms-powershell).

### Scenario Two: Assignment and unassignment of RBAC roles to Administrative Units in the Microsoft Entra admin center (AAD)

Global Administrators can assign any of the following RBAC roles using the method in the adjacent column:

|RBAC Role                              |Assignment method                                           |Documentation |

The role assignments listed in the table can also be applied directly to the intended users or groups. Learn more at [Use Microsoft Entra groups to manage role assignments - Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/groups-concept).

## Individual feature areas

### Device management

As a scoped administrator with the Teams device admin or Teams administrator role, you can:

- Access the Devices section in Teams admin center and view the list of devices assigned to the users in the Administrative unit
- Filter, sort, and search the devices by various criteria.
- Select a device and view its details, configuration, and status.
- Perform actions on the device, such as restart, reset, update, or assign to a user.

> [!NOTE]
> Export of devices isn’t available for scoped admin roles, you need to have tenant-wide permissions to export devices.

To learn more, see [Manage devices with administrative units](administrative-unit.md).

- Perform real-time or past meetings troubleshooting for a user in your Administrative Unit.

> [!NOTE]
> Export of users isn’t available for scoped admin roles, you need to have tenant-wide permissions to export users.

### Policy management

- Access the Policy sections in the Teams admin center and view the list of policies available in the tenant.
- Assign or unassign policies to a user or a group in your Administrative Unit.
- View the policy assignments and the effective policy for a user or a group in your Administrative Unit. Batch policy assignments are also enabled.

- Filter, sort, and export the reports by various criteria.
- Access the Call Quality Dashboard section in the Teams admin center and view the call quality data for the users in your Administrative Unit.

## Limitations for Administrative Units

Tasks that aren't available in this phase for a scoped administrator (regardless of the RBAC role), in either the Teams admin center or through the Teams PowerShell module:

- Teams and channel settings
- Audio conferencing, voice, and voicemail settings
- Guest access
- External access
- Calling plan and Operator Connect numbers 
- Emergency addresses
- Teams apps
- Tenant level settings and conference bridges
- Policy packages
- Emergency addresses, network topology, networks, and locations
- Frontline teams and apps
- Teams advisor and network planner
- Rules

## Teams PowerShell and Administrative Units

The functionality outlined in this article is available for the RBAC roles using Teams PowerShell. The differences in PowerShell are:

- An admin assigned with multiple Admin units is able to manage all the users across each admin unit simultaneously.
- In the Teams admin center, the scoped admin would have to select the particular Administrative Unit and manage those users within the Administrative Unit at any given time.

An example of using Teams PowerShell and Administrative Units is:

- An organization has three branches: North, South, and East. North and South branches are assigned to a single admin, and East is assigned to another admin.
- The scoped admin assigned with North and South branches is able to manage all the users across both North and South simultaneously using Teams PowerShell.
- In the Teams admin center, the scoped admin can either manage the North or South branch in turn, but not both at the same time.
