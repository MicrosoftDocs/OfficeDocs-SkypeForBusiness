![Stages of the upgrade journey, with emphasis on the User Readiness stage](media/upgrade-banner-user-readiness.png "Stages of the upgrade journey, with emphasis on the User Readiness stage")

This article is part of the User Readiness stage of your upgrade journey, an activity you complete in parallel with the Technical Readiness stage. Before proceeding, confirm that you’ve completed these activities from previous stages:

-   [Enlisted your project stakeholders](upgrade-enlist-stakeholders.md)
-   [Defined your project scope](https://aka.ms/SkypetoTeams-Scope)
-   [Understood coexistence and interoperability of Skype for Business and Teams](https://aka.ms/SkypeToTeams-Coexist)
-   [Chosen your upgrade journey](upgrade-and-coexistence-of-skypeforbusiness-and-teams.md)

# Assess organizational change readiness

After you’ve secured your project team and defined your vision, scope, and goals, the next step on your upgrade journey is to ensure that your organization and users are ready for Teams—an activity that you complete in parallel with ensuring your technical readiness. To realize value from Teams, users must actually use it. Simply enabling Teams doesn’t guarantee that you achieve your goal.  Users have different use cases and varying learning styles, and they adapt to new technology at different speeds. The good news is that managing change isn’t all that complicated, but it does take a focused effort. The guided discussions below are designed to help you understand your user base so that you can prepare the right level of education to facilitate and accelerate user adoption. There are three ways you should look at your user base:

-   **Organizational change readiness**: Understanding how quickly (or not) users typically react to change. This information will help inform the amount of awareness, training, and value-selling you might need to do to drive user adoption.
-   **Use cases**: Evaluating how the new technology will improve user productivity. This information will make the change relevant for users based on how they work.
-   **Personas**: Assessing which individuals or groups  might require personalized attention. This information will enable you to target training and awareness for those who expect or need more focused attention (for example, executives).

> [!Note]
> You can adapt the assessment activities given below to any change initiative in your organization. Simply address the questions based on the scope of your project. In the following discussions, “new solution” can apply to audio calling, audio conferencing, or your upgrade from Skype for Business to Teams.

| ![](media/audio_conferencing_image9.png)<br/>Next steps|<ul><li>Use the following guidance and associated activities to capture your organization’s user readiness profile.</li></ul>|

## Organizational change readiness

By assessing your organization’s readiness, you can determine how receptive (or not) your users are likely to be to changing the way they work and adopting new technology. Understanding how users react to change empowers your organization to proactively address concerns, adjust your rollout plan to get optimal buy-in, and identify users who can actually help you facilitate the change with their peers.

### Activity

Use the following conversation starters to conduct an organizational readiness assessment and document the culture of your organization when it comes to change. This information can help inform how much awareness and training you might need to implement for your project. Don’t worry about exact numbers. This exercise represents a general understanding of your organizational culture. If you need help getting started, simply evaluate a past rollout; this can help you anticipate how users might react to change and help you proactively address the reactions you expect.

#### What percentage of users fall into each bucket?

<!--
| **Type of user**                                               | **%** |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| *Early adopters* request the solution before it’s available.   |       |
| *Informed users* accept the solution as soon as its value is demonstrated.    |       |
| *Laggards* reject the solution, even when pushed into change. |       |
-->

| Early adopters  | Informed users  | Laggards |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| These users request the solution before it’s available. | These users accept the solution as soon as its value is demonstrated. | These users reject the solution, even when pushed into change. |


> [!Tip]
> Enlist your early adopters for your pilot testing in addition to serving as peer champions. Champions help evangelize new technology and lead by example to show their peers how to realize value. To learn more about creating a formal champions program, see the [Office adoption guide](https://fto365dev.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/DocResources/en-us/Office_365_Adoption_Guide.pdf). Your laggards might need more convincing before they adopt a new technology. If more than 20 percent of your organization falls into this bucket, spend more time communicating the value messaging and delivering tailored training. In addition, support them through the change by opening a feedback loop to better understand and address their hesitations.

#### What percentage of users fall into each competency?

<!--
| **Type of learner**                                                        | **%** |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| *Self-motivated* learners seek out resources, learn by doing.                      |       |
| *Team-players* enjoy group and interactive training; they’ll go along with coworkers. |       |
| *Hand-holding* seekers expect “white glove” or one-on-one assistance.      |       |
-->

| Self-motivated  | Team players  | Hand-holding seekers |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| These learners seek out resources, learn by doing. | These users enjoy group and interactive training; they’ll go along with coworkers. | These users expect “white glove” or one-on-one assistance. |

> [!Tip]
> Not everyone learns the same way. For those who are self-motivated, point to Microsoft’s online videos and training articles. If 20 percent or more are team players, enlist your training team or a partner to deliver live, interactive training (in person or online). Typically, you’ll find executives or targeted roles in the hand-holding category. This is a critical group who would benefit from personalized, short training sessions. Enlist your champions to help deliver training to these users, for an optimal experience.

## Use cases

Articulating specific use cases in your awareness and training plan makes users feel that you truly understand the way they work. There are universal use cases (scenarios that apply to everyone in your organization regardless of role) in addition to targeted use cases based on user profiles. For each, it’s important to identify the challenges of the current process and explain how the new technology can optimize the user experience. Then, use that information in your communication plan to help showcase the value of the new technology and generate a desire in users to give it a try.

### Activity

 Document five to seven universal and targeted use cases for your organization. Here are some conversation starters to review with your project team, followed by examples you can customize for your organization.

-   What is the use case/scenario?

-   What are core characteristics that define this scenario today? What apps are being used?

-   What are the challenges faced today with this use case?

-   How can Teams optimize the user experience?

-   Which would be the best use cases to highlight in your communications?

The following table shows examples of universal use cases for teamwork and collaboration.

## Personas

By doing people-level analysis, you gain understanding of your user personas and use cases. Taking time to understand who your users are and how they work, you‘ll help ensure they have what they need to be successful as they implement the change. This can include targeted messaging, training, or even devices such as headsets and webcams. For example, an executive might expect one-on-one training while a traveling field rep might benefit from a training video they can watch at their leisure. In addition, your people-level analysis can help identify who can move to Teams today versus who might be best served by waiting until later.

Begin by segmenting your user base into persona/cohort groups (for example, executives, “road warriors,” collaborative workers, or retail). For manageability, keep your list to no more than eight groups.

### Activity

Identify targeted user profiles that require specific technical or user readiness assistance. See below for a sample persona assessment for an Executive profile.

<table>
<tr><th colspan="2">Persona/Profile: Executive</th></tr>
<tr><td>What core characteristics define this persona (that is, who are they, what do they do)</td><td><ul><li>Voice/brand of the organization internally and externally</li><li>Relationship-focused</li><li>Fast-paced, dynamic schedules</li><li>Use mobile devices to stay connected</li><li>Rely on delegates as their “eyes and ears”</li><li>Spend most of their day in meetings or on the phone</li></ul></td></tr>
<tr><td>What are common use cases for this persona?<br><ital>Apply the universal use cases above to this persona, then elaborate on specific scenarios.</ital></td><td><ul><li>Personal productivity<ul><li>Customer and rapport-building calls</li></ul></li><li>Meetings<ul><li>C-level/stakeholder reviews</li><li>One-to-many: All-hands</li></ul></li><li>Project collaboration</li></ul></td></tr>
<tr><td>What functionality is required?</td><td><ul><li>Delegate synchronization</li><li>Contact management (internal and external)</li><li>Audio calling (PC and PSTN)</li><li>Video calling</li><li>Multiple device support</li><li>Application sharing</li></ul></td></tr>
