# Use Advisor for Teams to help you roll out Microsoft Teams

Advisor for Teams walks you through your Microsoft Teams rollout. It assesses your Microsoft 365 organization environment and identifies the most common configurations that you may need to update or modify before you can successfully roll out Teams. Then, Advisor for Teams creates a Deployment team (in Teams), with channels for each workload you want to roll out. Each workload in the Deployment team comes with a comprehensive Planner plan that includes all the rollout tasks for each workload.  Using this Planner plan, you'll assign tasks to the people responsible for each phase of the rollout - including the project manager, Teams admins, support people, and your adoption and user readiness team. Each rollout task contains all the guidance and resources you need to successfully complete the task.

Advisor for Teams is part of the [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com). At a minimum, you'll need a Microsoft 365 Business Basic license so you can take advantage of the Advisor for Teams integration with Forms and Planner. To begin using Advisor for Teams, click the **Start** button in the **Deploying Teams workload** widget on the Dashboard. Or go to **Planning** > **Teams Advisor**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Advisor for Teams isn't available for Microsoft 365 Government (GCC High or DoD) deployments.

For a guided overview of the Advisor for Teams experience, check out the [Deploy & Configure Microsoft Teams](https://youtu.be/o2mlsUubIO4?t=50) Microsoft Mechanics video.

## Using Advisor for Teams

**Teams, Forms, and Planner licenses are required to use Advisor for Teams.** However, you don't have to be a Teams admin to use Advisor for Teams - anybody in your organization can use it. We've set up special permissions so non-admin users can get to Advisor for Teams, even though it's in the Teams admin center. You DO have to be a Teams admin, Teams Administrator, or Global Administrator to open the tenant readiness assessments (this is because the special non-admin roles don't have access to the Microsoft Graph APIs underlying the assessments).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If **Teams Advisor** is missing under **Planning** in the Teams admin center, it means the user isn't licensed for Teams.

The first time you use Advisor for Teams, it will create a Deployment team for you in Teams. It adds a channel for each workload you select.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a Deployment team has already been created and a different user tries to create it, they'll get an error telling them to contact their support team. This prevents Teams from unintentionally disclosing information about the existing team and its members. Ask the owner of the Deployment team to add you, or contact your support person for help.

When you're done deploying that workload, go back to Advisor for Teams and select **Add channel** to start the next workload.



## Tenant assessment

Each plan includes a tenant readiness assessment that you can use to quickly identify aspects of your environment that may need remediation before you roll out Teams. The assessments include prerequisites and best practices. Each assessment test will have a green check mark or an orange warning triangle.

- <sub><img src="media/use-advisor-teams-roll-out-image2.png" alt="Green check mark"/></img></sub>A green check mark means your tenant passed the specific test.
- <sub><img src="media/use-advisor-teams-roll-out-image1.png" alt="Yellow alert mark"/></img></sub>An orange warning triangle means that we suggest you follow up to determine if any action is needed (for example, a Microsoft 365 Group expiration policy is recommended but not required).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once a user with an Administrative role starts Advisor for Teams, all assessments run in the background. If you update or remediate something, it may not be reflected in your assessments for up to 24 hours.

The sections below describe each assessment, including whether something is a prerequisite or best practices, what each assessment checks is doing and why, and guidance for remediation as needed.

### Assessment tests for all workloads

|Assessment test  |What it tells you  |
|---------|---------|
|Vanity domain configured     |Whether there's a non-@onmicrosoft.com domain configured for your tenant (for example, @contoso.onmicrosoft.com). You can use the @onmicrosoft.com domain, of course, or you can configure a vanity domain - your choice. For more information, read [Add a domain to Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/admin/setup/add-domain). |
|Teams licenses     |This is a prerequisite - you **must have** Teams licenses in order to roll out Teams. Queries the Microsoft Graph to see whether you have Teams licenses (with at least one license available to assign). For more information, read [Microsoft Teams service description](/office365/servicedescriptions/teams-service-description).    |
|Exchange Online licenses     |Whether you have an active subscription with available Exchange Online licenses. While Exchange isn't required for basic Teams functionality, integration with Exchange provides an optimal Teams experience. Queries the Microsoft Graph to analyze the subscriptions associated with your tenant and validate whether you have subscriptions with an eligible Exchange Online license (with at least one license available to assign). For more information, read [How Exchange and Teams interact](exchange-teams-interact.md).    |
|SharePoint Online licenses     |Whether you have an active subscription with available SharePoint Online licenses. We recommend per-user SharePoint Online licenses to provide OneDrive for Business for file storage in chats. Queries the Microsoft Graph to see whether you have SharePoint Online licenses (with at least one license available to assign). For more information, read [How SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business interact with Teams](./sharepoint-onedrive-interact.md).    |
|Guest access enabled     |Whether [guest access](guest-access.md) is turned on. Guest access lets you invite external users to your join your teams. See [Collaborate with guests in a team](/microsoft-365/solutions/collaborate-as-team) to walk through turning on guest access in Teams; the checklist includes the required Microsoft Entra configurations. |
|External access configured     |Whether [external access](manage-external-access.md) is turned on. By default, it's turned on, with open federation. |

### Assessments for chat, teams, channels, and apps

In addition to the [Assessment tests for all workloads](#assessment-tests-for-all-workloads), the following additional assessments are run for the chat, teams, channels, and apps workload:

|Assessment test  |What it tells you  |
|---------|---------|
|Microsoft 365 Group naming policy configured     |Whether naming standards have been configured for Microsoft 365 Groups. Microsoft 365 Groups naming policy enables your organization to apply a consistent naming strategy to user-created teams and also applies to other Groups workloads (including Outlook, SharePoint, Planner, and Viva Engage). This test queries Microsoft Entra ID via the Microsoft Graph to check for the existence of naming policies that apply to Microsoft 365 Groups. For more information, read [Groups naming policy](/microsoft-365/admin/create-groups/groups-naming-policy).    |
|Microsoft 365 Group Expiration Policy configured     |Whether a Group Expiration Policy has been defined for Microsoft 365 Groups. This enables your organization to automatically remove inactive Teams. It's turned off by default. This test queries Microsoft Entra ID via the Microsoft Graph and reports whether the value has been modified from the default. For more information, read [Microsoft 365 group expiration policy](/microsoft-365/admin/create-groups/office-365-groups-expiration-policy).    |

### Assessments for meetings and conferencing

In addition to the [Assessment tests for all workloads](#assessment-tests-for-all-workloads), the following additional assessments are run for the meetings and conferencing workload:

|Assessment test  |What it tells you  |
|---------|---------|
|Audio Conferencing licenses    |Whether you have an active subscription with Audio conferencing licenses. This is a prerequisite if you're deploying Audio conferencing bridges. Queries the Microsoft Graph to see whether you have Audio Conferencing licenses (with at least one license available to assign) For more information, read [Teams add-on licensing](./teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md).    |
|Stream licenses     |Whether you have an active subscription with Microsoft Stream licenses. This is a prerequisite if you want to turn on Meeting Recording.

## Advisor for Teams and Microsoft 365 learning pathways

[Microsoft 365 learning pathways](/office365/customlearning/) is an on-demand learning solution that you can customize to train your users, and increase usage and adoption of Teams in your organization. Use learning pathways together with Advisor for Teams to get your users up and running quickly and drive adoption.

Learning pathways gives you a SharePoint Online site template and the ability to easily build a learning site for your users. You can customize the learning pathways training portal to include training and support content specific to your users' needs. Use the Teams playlists from the Microsoft online catalog and add your own.

You can build a learning site in learning pathways, and then add it as a tab to a channel in teams for quick and easy access by users.

For example, use Advisor for Teams together with learning pathways to train your help desk and Champions, and then let learning pathways support training your end users. Build a learning site to help onboard your help desk and Champions to Teams, and then add it as a tab to each workload channel that you're rolling out. Your help desk and Champions can then create a support page on the learning pathways training portal with links and custom playlists to support your users on Teams. This support page can be added to a channel in any team to help train your end users.

The following is an overview of how you can use Advisor for Teams together with learning pathways.

### Get started in learning pathways

To get started with learning pathways, check out [Get started with learning pathways](/office365/customlearning/).

To set up a new learning pathways solution in your environment, see [Provision a new learning pathways solution](/office365/customlearning/custom_provision).

### Create a learning plan

#### Plan your learning content

Before you build your site in learning pathways, take some time to review and collect the learning resources and capabilities available to you. With learning pathways, you can use content from the Microsoft 365 training page and add content that you create to tailor the site to your unique needs.

To learn more, see [Plan your learning pathways content](/office365/customlearning/custom_plancontent) and [Resources for supporting your remote workforce](/office365/customlearning/custom_plancontent_remoteresources).

#### Explore Teams content in learning pathways

Learning pathways provides a SharePoint site with a web part that's connected to an online catalog. The Microsoft 365 training page, which hosts the web part, shows all the training available in learning pathways. Have a look around to get familiar with what's available and how content is organized.

[Go to your learning pathways site](/office365/customlearning/custom_goto), select **Microsoft 365 training**, and then select **Microsoft Teams** to see all the Teams training playlists in the online catalog. Select a playlist and then select the **Next** and **Previous** buttons to navigate through it. You can also click the down arrow to view the contents of the playlist and go to a specific topic.

#### Take an inventory of Teams learning resources in your organization

Review the Teams learning content that's already available in your organization. For example, you may have already developed custom onboarding, training, or support content for Teams. Your existing SharePoint assets can be mixed with Microsoft content in a playlist to build a targeted playlist for your organization.

#### Build your site in learning pathways

The [Admin Success Center](/office365/customlearning/custom_successcenter) in learning pathways provides guidance and resources to help you plan and customize learning pathways in your organization. Learn how to [customize the site](/office365/customlearning/custom_overview), show and hide content, build custom playlists, and more.

To access the Admin Success Center, on the learning pathways Home page, select **Admin Success Center**.

#### Add your site to Teams

When your site is ready, add it to a channel in any team for quick and easy access.

1. In Teams, go to the team, and then select a channel.
2. At the top of the channel page, select **+** (**Add a tab**).
3. Select **SharePoint Pages**, and then select **Add a page from any SharePoint site**.
4. Paste the URL of your learning pathways site, and then select **Save**.

To learn more, see [Add a SharePoint page or list to a channel in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-a-sharepoint-page-or-list-to-a-channel-in-teams-131edef1-455f-4c67-a8ce-efa2ebf25f0b).

### Train your support team

Use the resources in your learning pathways site to onboard your help desk and Champions to Teams. Get them ready with the tools and information they need to support your users on Teams.

For guidance and resources on preparing your help desk and Champions for Teams, see [Train your org](https://adoption.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/#train-your-org) and [Build Champions](https://adoption.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/#build-champions).

As the go-to contact for your users for “how to” questions, your help desk and Champions can use the learning pathways site to train users and as an alternative to creating support tickets. Encourage your help desk and Champions to [customize your learning pathways site](/office365/customlearning/) by building a training and support page, and then [add it  as a tab to a channel](#add-your-site-to-teams) in a team for users to self-serve.

### Drive adoption

After you have customized your site and put together your learning plans, consider how you'll drive awareness with your users to encourage them to use learning pathways for ongoing learning.

Use your communication channels to promote the site and generate awareness. For example, include a standard tagline such as “Check out our training and support site for how to get productive with Teams” in communications to your users.

Engage your users by highlighting the ways they can collaborate in Teams, and then direct them to the learning pathways site to learn how.

Check out these resources, which include guidance, adoption kits, best practices, and more, to help you implement a successful rollout and adoption plan.
