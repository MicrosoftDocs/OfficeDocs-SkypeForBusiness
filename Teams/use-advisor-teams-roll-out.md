# Use Advisor for Teams to help you roll out Microsoft Teams

Advisor for Teams walks you through your Microsoft Teams rollout. It assesses your Microsoft 365 organization environment and identifies the most common configurations that you may need to update or modify before you can successfully roll out Teams. Then, Advisor for Teams creates a Deployment team (in Teams), with channels for each workload you want to roll out. Each workload in the Deployment team comes with a comprehensive Planner plan that includes all the rollout tasks for each workload.  Using this Planner plan, you'll assign tasks to the people responsible for each phase of the rollout - including the project manager, Teams service admins, support people, and your adoption and user readiness team. Each rollout task contains all the guidance and resources you need to successfully complete the task.

Advisor for Teams is part of the [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com). At a minimum, you'll need a Microsoft 365 Business Basic license so you can take advantage of the Advisor for Teams integration with Forms and Planner. To begin using Advisor for Teams, click the **Start** button in the **Deploying Teams workload** widget on the Dashboard. Or go to **Planning** > **Teams Advisor**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Advisor for Teams isn't available for Microsoft 365 Government (GCC High or DoD) deployments.

For a guided overview of the Advisor for Teams experience, check out the [Deploy & Configure Microsoft Teams](https://youtu.be/o2mlsUubIO4?t=50) Microsoft Mechanics video.

## Using Advisor for Teams

**Teams, Forms, and Planner licenses are required to use Advisor for Teams.** However, you don't have to be a Teams admin to use Advisor for Teams - anybody in your organization can use it. We've set up special permissions so non-admin users can get to Advisor for Teams, even though it's in the Teams admin center. You DO have to be a Teams admin, Teams Service Administrator, or Global Administrator to open the tenant readiness assessments (this is because the special non-admin roles don't have access to the Microsoft Graph APIs underlying the assessments).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If **Teams Advisor** is missing under **Planning** in the Teams admin center, it means the user isn't licensed for Teams.

The first time you use Advisor for Teams, it'll create a Deployment team for you in Teams. It adds a channel for each workload you select.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a Deployment team has already been created and a different user tries to create it, they'll get an error telling them to contact their support team. This prevents Teams from unintentionally disclosing information about the existing team and its members. Ask the owner of the Deployment team to add you, or contact your support person for help.

## Available Advisor for Teams plans

Advisor for Teams currently provides the following plans:

1. Chat, teams, channels, and apps
    - Tenant assessment
    - Planner plan, including adoption tasks
    - Forms user survey
    - Advisor for Teams bot
1. Meetings and conferencing
    - Tenant assessment
    - Planner plan, including adoption tasks

    - Advisor for Teams bot
1. Skype for Business upgrade
    - Tenant assessment
    - Planner plan, including adoption tasks
    - Forms user survey
    - Advisor for Teams bot
    - Designed for customers who are currently using Skype for Business Online or Skype for Business on-premises environments, the Skype for Business upgrade plan will help you take the guesswork out of your upgrade journey. Leveraging a proven success framework for implementing change, the plan will guide you through the step-by-step process whether youâ€™re just getting started with Teams, already using Teams alongside Skype for Business, or ready to upgrade. The plan will also connect you to [online guidance and best practices](https://aka.ms/SkypeToTeams),  [downloadable assets](https://aka.ms/UpgradeSuccessKit), [live 1:many planning workshops](https://aka.ms/UpgradeWorkshops), and additional resources to support your success.

We recommend that you start with the Chat, teams, channels, and apps plan. When you're done deploying that workload, go back to Advisor for Teams and click **Add channel** to start the next workload.

## Tenant assessment
Each plan includes a tenant readiness assessment that you can use to quickly identify aspects of your environment that may need remediation before you roll out Teams. The assessments include prerequisites and best practices. Each assessment test will have a green check mark or an orange warning triangle. 

- <sub><img src="media/use-advisor-teams-roll-out-image2.png" alt="Green check mark"/></img></sub>A green check mark means your tenant passed the specific test. 
- <sub><img src="media/use-advisor-teams-roll-out-image1.png" alt="Yellow alert mark"/></img></sub>An orange warning triangle means that we suggest you follow up to determine if any action is needed (for example, a Microsoft 365 Group expiration policy is recommended but not required).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once a user with an Administrative role starts Advisor for Teams, all assessments run in the background. If you update or remediate something, it may not be reflected in your assessments for up to 24 hours.

The sections below describe each assessment, including whether something is a prerequisite or best practices, what each assessment checks is doing and why, and guidance for remediation as needed.

### Assessment tests for all workloads

|Assessment test  |What it tells you  |
|---------|---------|
|Vanity domain configured     |Whether there's a non-@onmicrosoft.com domain configured for your tenant (for example, @contoso.onmicrosoft.com). You can use the @onmicrosoft.com domain, of course, or you can configure a vanity domain - your choice. For more information, read [Add a domain to Microsoft 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/setup/add-domain). |
|Teams licenses     |This is a prerequisite - you **must have** Teams licenses in order to roll out Teams. Queries the Microsoft Graph to see whether you have Teams licenses (with at least one license available to assign). For more information, read [Microsoft Teams service description](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/teams-service-description).    |
|Exchange Online licenses     |Whether you have an active subscription with available Exchange Online licenses. While Exchange isn't required for basic Teams functionality, integration with Exchange provides an optimal Teams experience. Queries the Microsoft Graph to analyze the subscriptions associated with your tenant and validate whether you have subscriptions with an eligible Exchange Online license (with at least one license available to assign). For more information, read [How Exchange and Teams interact](exchange-teams-interact.md).    |
|SharePoint Online licenses     |Whether you have an active subscription with available SharePoint Online licenses. We recommend per-user SharePoint Online licenses to provide OneDrive for Business for file storage in chats. Queries the Microsoft Graph to see whether you have SharePoint Online licenses (with at least one license available to assign). For more information, read [How SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business interact with Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/sharepoint-onedrive-interact).    |
|Guest access enabled     |Whether [guest access](guest-access.md) is turned on. Guest access lets you invite external users to your join your teams. See [Collaborate with guests in a team](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/solutions/collaborate-as-team) to walk through turning on guest access in Teams; the checklist includes the required Azure AD configurations. |
|External access configured     |Whether [external access](manage-external-access.md) is turned on. By default, it's turned on, with open federation. |

### Assessments for chat, teams, channels, and apps

In addition to the [Assessment tests for all workloads](#assessment-tests-for-all-workloads), the following additional assessments are run for the chat, teams, channels, and apps workload:

|Assessment test  |What it tells you  |
|---------|---------|
|Microsoft 365 Group naming policy configured     |Whether naming standards have been configured for Microsoft 365 Groups. Microsoft 365 Groups naming policy enables your organization to apply a consistent naming strategy to user-created teams and also applies to other Groups workloads (including Outlook, SharePoint, Planner, and Yammer). This test queries Azure AD via the Microsoft Graph to check for the existence of naming policies that apply to Microsoft 365 Groups. For more information, read [Groups naming policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/create-groups/groups-naming-policy).    |
|Microsoft 365 Group Expiration Policy configured     |Whether a Group Expiration Policy has been defined for Microsoft 365 Groups. This enables your organization to automatically remove inactive Teams. It's turned off by default. This test queries Azure AD via the Microsoft Graph and reports whether the value has been modified from the default. For more information, read [Microsoft 365 group expiration policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/create-groups/office-365-groups-expiration-policy).    |

### Assessments for meetings and conferencing

In addition to the [Assessment tests for all workloads](#assessment-tests-for-all-workloads), the following additional assessments are run for the meetings and conferencing workload:

|Assessment test  |What it tells you  |
|---------|---------|
|Audio Conferencing licenses    |Whether you have an active subscription with Audio conferencing licenses. This is a prerequisite if you're deploying Audio conferencing bridges. Queries the Microsoft Graph to see whether you have Audio Conferencing licenses (with at least one license available to assign) For more information, read [Teams add-on licensing](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing).    |
|Stream licenses     |Whether you have an active subscription with Microsoft Stream licenses. This is a prerequisite if you want to turn on Meeting Recording.
