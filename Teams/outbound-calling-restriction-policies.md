# Outbound calling restriction policies for Audio Conferencing and user PSTN calls

As an administrator, you can use outbound call controls to restrict the type of audio conferencing and end user PSTN calls that can be made by users in your organization. 

Outbound call controls can be applied on a per-user basis and provide the following two controls to independently restrict each type of outbound calls. By default, both controls are set to allow international and domestic outbound calls. 

|Control|Description|Control options|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Audio Conferencing PSTN calls|Restricts the type of outbound </br>calls that are allowed from within </br>meetings organized by a user.|Any destination (default)</br>In the same country or region as the organizor </br> </br>Zone A countries or regions only </br>Don't allow|
|End user PSTN calls|Restricts the type of calls </br>that can be made by a user.|International and Domestic (default)</br>Domestic</br>None|

To find out which countries/regions are considered Zone A, see [Zone A countries/regions](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/calling-plans-for-office-365).

   > [!NOTE]
   > A call is considered domestic if the number dialed is in the same country where Microsoft 365 or Office 365 has been set up for the organizer of the meeting (in the case of audio conferencing), or the end user (in the case of end user PSTN calls).

**Using PowerShell**

Outbound call restrictions are controlled by a single policy called OnlineDialOutPolicy which has a restriction attribute for each. The policy cannot be customized, rather there are pre-defined policy instances for each combination of the settings. 

You can use the Get-CSOnlineDialOutPolicy cmdlet to view the outbound calling policies and assign them to users by using the Grant-CSDialOutPolicy cmdlet. (Please note that the Grant cmdlet doesn't contain the word "Online" as the Get cmdlet does.) 

The following table provides an overview of each policy.
