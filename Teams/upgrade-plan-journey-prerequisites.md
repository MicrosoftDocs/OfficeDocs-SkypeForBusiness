# Prerequisites and environmental dependencies for Teams

Teams combines multiple Office 365 services, and is therefore dependent on the correct implementation and operation of these services. These services include—but aren’t limited to—SharePoint Online, Exchange Online, and OneDrive for Business.

Although not all services are required, we highly recommend that you implement all of them. If you choose not to implement certain services, it will affect the functionality that Teams can offer your organization. For example, though you don’t have to implement SharePoint Online, Teams does rely on SharePoint Online for certain functionality such as file sharing in group conversations, so not implementing this service will reduce the functionality offered through the client.

See the following articles to learn about prerequisites and how Teams interacts with other technologies:

-   If your organization hasn’t deployed any Office 365 workloads, see [Getting Started with Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/article/Get-started-with-Office-365-for-Business-d6466f0d-5d13-464a-adcb-00906ae87029).

-   If your organization hasn’t added or configured a verified domain for Office 365, see [Verify your Office 365 domain](https://support.office.com/article/Verify-your-Office-365-domain-to-prove-ownership-nonprofit-or-education-status-or-to-activate-Yammer-87d1844e-aa47-4dc0-a61b-1b773fd4e590).

-   If your organization hasn’t synchronized identities to Azure Active Directory, see [Identity models and authentication in Microsoft Teams](identify-models-authentication.md).

-   If your organization doesn¹t have Exchange Online, see [Understand how Exchange and Microsoft Teams interact](Exchange-Teams-interact.md).

-   If your organization doesn’t have SharePoint Online, see [Understand how SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business interact with Microsoft Teams](SharePoint-OneDrive-interact.md).

-   Learn how [Office 365 groups and Microsoft Teams interact](Office-365-groups.md).

-   If your organization is an educational institution and you use a Student Information System, [deploy School Data Sync](https://docs.microsoft.com/schooldatasync) before deploying Microsoft Teams.
																		   

After you’ve verified that your environment meets all applicable prerequisites, [evaluate your current environment for Teams](upgrade-plan-journey-evaluate-environment.md).
