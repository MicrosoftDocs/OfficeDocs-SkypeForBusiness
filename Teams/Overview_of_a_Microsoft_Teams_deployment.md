Overview of a Microsoft Teams deployment
========================================

A typical Microsoft Teams journey may take the following form:

1.  Technical and legal assessment in the early stages to identify and define what controls are required to implement Microsoft Teams in your organization.

2.  Undertake a Network assessment and prepare for the rollout. At this point you can start to create the adoption and change management strategy and key user stories that drive user engagement during and after the rollout.

3.  Test these change management and adoption strategies with an IT Pilot.

4.  Refine and run a business pilot in one or two business units leveraging these strategies.

5.  Refine and leverage the strategy and learnings for a wider rollout.

During the journey, one of the first uses of Microsoft Teams in your environment is the IT Pilot. Consider leveraging this pilot to help your team engage to plan, deliver, and operate Microsoft Teams and outreach to the business users.

Here’s an example of how you could set up a team / channel structure to help drive towards your goal of delighting your end users through the delivery of Microsoft Teams. To get your business units thinking of how to set up their own teams and channels, you could share how you set up your first team / channels to help them and perhaps encourage users to create a simple table like the one below to drive the conversation.

This setup would look like this in Microsoft Teams:
