# Audio Conferencing pay-per-minute

In addition to the standard Audio Conferencing per-user license, Volume and Licensing organizations can also choose a pay-per-minute offer to enable Audio Conferencing capabilities for their organizations.
  

You can find out if your [country/region is supported](country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md) for Audio Conferencing.

  
> [!NOTE]
> Because this offer is only available to Volume and Licensing customers, you will need to work with your account representative to acquire licenses. 
  
## Need some details?

Whereas the Audio Conferencing per-user license offer includes dial-in usage and some dial-out usage, Audio Conferencing pay-per-minute **allows you to pay for all of your Audio Conferencing usage on a per-minute basis without paying for a per-user monthly license**. With this, all dial-in and dial-out calls will be charged on a per-minute basis, including:
  
- Inbound calls to toll Audio Conferencing numbers of your organization.
    
- Inbound calls to toll-free Audio Conferencing numbers of your organization.
    
- Outbound calls placed to external phone numbers from within a meeting of your organization.
    
> [!NOTE]
> You can find the dial-in and dial-out rates associated to these types of calls by reviewing the **See rates for where you want to call section** in [Audio Conferencing](https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/online-meeting-solutions#Rates).
  
Pay-per-minute requires your organization to have [Communications Credits](what-are-communications-credits.md) enabled with a license assigned to each user in order for Audio Conferencing to work. If you want more details, see [Set up Communications Credits for your organization](set-up-communications-credits-for-your-organization.md) and/or [Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](/SkypeForBusiness/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing).
