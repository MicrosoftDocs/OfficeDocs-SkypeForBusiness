# Audio Conferencing pay-per-minute

In addition to the standard Audio Conferencing per-user license, Volume and Licensing organizations can also choose a pay-per-minute offer to enable Audio Conferencing capabilities for their organizations.
  

You can find out if your [country/region is supported](country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md) for Audio Conferencing.

  
> [!NOTE]
> Because this offer is only available to Volume and Licensing customers, you will need to work with your account representative to acquire licenses. 
  
## Need some details?

Whereas the Audio Conferencing per-user license offer includes dial-in usage and some dial-out usage, Audio Conferencing pay-per-minute **allows you to pay for all of your Audio Conferencing usage on a per-minute basis without paying for a per-user monthly license**. With this, all dial-in and dial-out calls will be charged on a per-minute basis, including:
  
- Inbound calls to toll Audio Conferencing numbers of your organization.
    
- Inbound calls to toll-free Audio Conferencing numbers of your organization.
    
- Outbound calls placed to external phone numbers from within a meeting of your organization.
    
> [!NOTE]
> You can find the dial-in and dial-out rates associated to these types of calls by reviewing the **See rates for where you want to call section** in [Audio Conferencing](https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/online-meeting-solutions#Rates).
  
Pay-per-minute requires your organization to have [Communications Credits](what-are-communications-credits.md) enabled with a license assigned to each user in order for Audio Conferencing to work. If you want more details, see [Set up Communications Credits for your organization](set-up-communications-credits-for-your-organization.md) and/or [Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md).
  
To enable Audio Conferencing pay-per-minute for users in your organization, see [Try or purchase Audio Conferencing in Office 365](try-or-purchase-audio-conferencing-in-office-365-for-teams.md).

## Why is it best for you?

- Pay per-minute will only be charged on a per-minute basis for each inbound or outbound call placed by each attendee during a scheduled meeting (rates vary for toll or toll-free call and by destination) instead of using Skype for Business or Teams application in a mobile device or PC.

- Capability to manage cost since admins can control to restrict the types of dial-outs (international and domestic) that can be done from the meetings of an organizer. See [Outbound calling restriction policies for Audio Conferencing and user PSTN calls](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/audio-conferencing-in-office-365/outbound-calling-restriction-policies)

- If you have Audio Conferencing pay-per-minute licenses, you don't have to assign Communications Credits licenses separately to each user specifically for Audio Conferencing usage (you might still need to assign them for other services).

- Control and monitor pay-per minute charges by using Communications Credits.

- More flexibility in pricing for customers who don't need all users on a subscription basis. 

- Enable Audio Conferencing pay-per-minute along with a monthly subscription of E5 or a standalone Audio Conferencing subscription, both services will continue to work the same way. Changes will have no effect on the operations of Audio Conferencing or Communications Credits.
