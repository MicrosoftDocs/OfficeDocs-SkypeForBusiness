# Meeting policy settings for audio & video

<a name="bkaudioandvideo"> </a>
<a name="ndi"> </a>

This article describes the meeting policy settings specific to audio and video. These include the following:

- [Allow transcription](#allow-transcription)
- [Allow cloud recording](#allow-cloud-recording)
- [Mode for IP audio](#mode-for-ip-audio) 
- [Mode for IP video](#mode-for-ip-video) 
- [Allow IP video](#allow-ip-video)
- [Media bit rate (Kbs)](#media-bit-rate-kbs)
- [Video vilters mode](#video-filters-mode)

### Allow transcription

This is a combination of a per-organizer and per-user policy. This setting controls whether captions and transcription features are available during playback of meeting recordings. If you turn this off, the **Search** and **CC** options won't be available during playback of a meeting recording. The person who started the recording needs this setting turned on so that the recording also includes transcription.

Note that transcription for recorded meetings is currently only supported for users who have the language in Teams set to English and when English is spoken in the meeting.

### Allow cloud recording

This is a combination of a per-organizer and per-user policy. This setting controls whether this user's meetings can be recorded. The recording can be started by the meeting organizer or by another meeting participant if the policy setting is turned on for the participant and if they're an authenticated user from the same organization.

People outside your organization, such as federated and anonymous users, can't start the recording. Guest users can't start or stop the recording.

Let's look at the following example.

|User |Meeting policy  |Allow cloud recording |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Daniela | Global   | Off |
|Amanda | Location1MeetingPolicy | On|
|John (external user) | Not applicable | Not applicable|

Meetings organized by Daniela can't be recorded and Amanda, who has the policy setting enabled, can't record meetings organized by Daniela. Meetings organized by Amanda can be recorded, however,  Daniela, who has the policy setting disabled and John who is an external user, can't record meetings organized by Amanda.

To learn more about cloud meeting recording, see [Teams cloud meeting recording](cloud-recording.md).

### Mode for IP audio

This is a per-user policy. This setting controls whether audio can be turned on in meetings and group calls. Here are the values for this setting.

|Setting value |Behavior  |
|---------|---------|
|**Outgoing and incoming audio enabled**    |Outgoing and incoming audio is allowed in the meeting. This is the default setting. |
|**Disabled**     |Outgoing and incoming audio is turned off in the meeting.     |

If set to **Disabled** for a user, that user can still schedule and organize meetings but they can't use audio. To join a meeting, they have to dial in through the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or have the meeting call and join them by phone. Meeting participants who don't have any policies assigned (for example, anonymous participants) have this set to **Outgoing and incoming audio enabled** by default. On Teams mobile clients, if this setting is disabled, the user has to dial in to the meeting through the PSTN.

This setting doesn't apply to 1:1 calls. To restrict 1:1 calls, configure a Teams [calling policy](teams-calling-policy.md) and turn off the **Make private calls** setting. This setting also doesn't apply to conference room devices such as Surface Hub and Microsoft Teams Rooms devices.

This setting isn't yet available for Microsoft 365 Government Community Cloud (GCC), GCC High, or Department of Defense (DoD) environments.

To learn more, see [Manage audio/video for meeting participants](#manage-audiovideo-for-meeting-participants).

### Mode for IP video

This is a per-user policy. This setting controls whether video can be turned on in meetings and group calls. Here are the values for this setting.

|Setting value |Behavior  |
|---------|---------|
|**Outgoing and incoming video enabled**    | Outgoing and incoming video is allowed in the meeting. This is the default setting. |
|**Disabled**     | Outgoing and incoming video is turned off in the meeting. On Teams mobile clients, users can't share videos or photos in the meeting. <br><br>Note that if **Mode for IP audio** is disabled, then **Mode for IP video** will also remain disabled.  |

If set to **Disabled** for a  user, that user can't turn on video or view videos shared by other meeting participants. Meeting participants who don't have any policies assigned (for example, anonymous participants) have this set to **Outgoing and incoming video enabled** by default.

This setting doesn't apply to conference room devices such as Surface Hub and Microsoft Teams Rooms devices. 

This setting isn't yet available for Microsoft 365 Government Community Cloud (GCC), GCC High, or Department of Defense (DoD) environments.

> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind that this setting controls both outgoing and incoming video whereas the **Allow IP video** setting controls outgoing video. To learn more, see [Which IP video policy setting takes precedence?](#which-ip-video-policy-setting-takes-precedence) and [Manage audio/video for meeting participants](#manage-audiovideo-for-meeting-participants).

To learn more, see [Manage audio/video for meeting participants](#manage-audiovideo-for-meeting-participants).

### Allow IP video

This is a combination of a per-organizer and per-user policy. Video is a key component to meetings. In some organizations, admins might want more control over which users' meetings have video. This setting controls whether video can be turned on in meetings hosted by a user and in 1:1 and group calls started by a user. On Teams mobile clients, this setting controls whether users can share photos and videos in a meeting. 

Meetings organized by a user who has this policy setting enabled, allow video sharing in the meeting by the meeting participants, if the participants also have the policy setting enabled. Meeting participants who don't have any policies assigned (for example, anonymous and federated participants) inherit the policy of the meeting organizer.

> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind that this setting controls outgoing video whereas the **Mode for IP video** setting controls both outgoing and incoming video. To learn more, see [Which IP video policy setting takes precedence?](#which-ip-video-policy-setting-takes-precedence) and [Manage audio/video for meeting participants](#manage-audiovideo-for-meeting-participants).

| Teams desktop and web client |Teams mobile client  |
|:-------:|:-------:|
|![Screenshot showing meeting join with audio/video settings on desktop](media/meeting-policies-audio-video-settings.png)    |![Screenshot showing meeting join sreen with audio/video settings on mobile](media/meeting-policies-mobile-join.png)          |

Let's look at the following example.

|User |Meeting policy  |Allow IP video |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Daniela   | Global   | On       |
|Amanda    | Location1MeetingPolicy        | Off      |

Meetings hosted by Daniela allow video to be turned on. Daniela can join the meeting and turn on video. Amanda can't turn on video in Daniela's meeting because Amanda's policy is set to not allow video. Amanda can see videos shared by other participants in the meeting.

In meetings hosted by Amanda, no one can turn on video, regardless of the video policy assigned to them. This means Daniela can't turn on video in Amanda's meetings.  

If Daniela calls Amanda with video on, Amanda can answer the call with audio only.  When the call is connected, Amanda can see Daniela's video, but can't turn on video. If Amanda calls Daniela, Daniela can answer the call with video and audio. When the call is connected, Daniela can turn on or turn off her video, as needed.

To learn more, see [Manage audio/video for meeting participants](#manage-audiovideo-for-meeting-participants).

#### Which IP video policy setting takes precedence?

For a user, the most restrictive policy setting for video takes precedence. Here's some examples.

|Allow IP video|Mode for IP video|Meeting experience|
|---------|---------|---------|
|Organizer: **On**<br><br>Participant: **On** |Participant: **Disabled**        |The **Mode for IP video** setting takes precedence. The participant who is assigned this policy can't turn on or view videos shared by others.|
|Organizer: **On**<br><br>Participant: **On** |Participant: **Outgoing and incoming video enabled**          |The participant who is assigned this policy can turn on or view videos shared by others.         |
|Organizer: **On**<br><br>Participant: **Off** |Participant: **Outgoing and incoming video enabled**         |The **Allow IP video** setting takes precedence. Participants can only see incoming video and can't send outgoing video.         |
|Organizer: **On**<br><br>Participant: **Off** |Participant: **Disabled**         |The **Mode for IP video** setting takes precedence. The participant can't see incoming or outgoing video.|
|Organizer: **Off**    |       |The **Allow IP video** setting takes precedence because it's turned off for the organizer. No one can turn on video in meetings organized by the user who is assigned this policy.         |

### Manage audio/video for meeting participants

|If you want to...  |Set the following policy settings  |
|---------|---------|
|Disable audio and video for participants in meetings  |Mode for IP audio: **Disabled**<br> Mode for IP video: **Disabled**<br>Allow IP video: N/A       |
|Enable only incoming video and audio for participants in meetings  |Mode for IP audio: **Outgoing and incoming audio enabled**<br> Mode for IP video: **Outgoing and incoming video enabled**<br>Allow IP video: **Off**       |
|Disable video for participants in meetings (participants have audio only)|  Mode for IP audio: **Enable outgoing and incoming audio**<br> Mode for IP video: **Disabled**<br>Allow IP video: N/A        
|Enable audio and video for participants in meetings    |Mode for IP audio: **Outgoing and incoming audio enabled** (default)<br> Mode for IP video: **Outgoing and incoming video enabled** (default)<br>Allow IP video: **On** (default)    |

The most restrictive policy between the meeting organizer’s policy and the user’s policy applies. For example, if an organizer has a policy that restricts video and a user’s policy doesn't restrict video, meeting participants inherit the policy of the meeting organizer and don't have access to video in meetings. This means that they can join the meeting with audio only.

> [!NOTE]
> When a user starts a group call to join by phone, the **Use phone for audio** screen doesn't appear. This is a known issue that we're working to resolve. To work around this issue, select **Phone audio** under **Other join options**.  

#### Teams mobile clients

For users on Teams mobile clients, the ability to share photos and videos during a meeting is also determined by the **Allow IP video** or **IP video mode** setting. Depending on which policy setting takes precedence, the ability to share videos and photos won't be available. This doesn't affect screen sharing, which you configure using a separate [Screen sharing mode](meeting-policies-content-sharing.md#screen-sharing-mode) setting. Additionally, you can set a [Teams mobility policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/new-csteamsmobilitypolicy) to prevent mobile users from using IP video over a cellular connection, which means they must use a WiFi connection.

### Media bit rate (Kbs)

This is a per-user policy. This setting determines the media bit rate for audio, video, and video-based app sharing transmissions in calls and meetings for the user. It's applied to both the uplink and downlink media traversal for users in the call or meeting. This setting gives you granular control over managing bandwidth in your organization. Depending on the meetings scenarios required by users, we recommend having enough bandwidth in place for a good quality experience. The minimum value is 30 Kbps and the maximum value depends on the meeting scenario. To learn more about the minimum recommended bandwidth for good quality meetings, calls, and live events in Teams, see [Bandwidth requirements](prepare-network.md#bandwidth-requirements).

If there isn't enough bandwidth for a meeting, participants see a message that indicates poor network quality.

For meetings that need the highest-quality video experience, such as CEO board meetings and Teams live events, we recommend you set the bandwidth to 10 Mbps. Even when the maximum experience is set, the Teams media stack adapts to low-bandwidth conditions when certain network conditions are detected, depending on the scenario.

## Video filters mode

<a name="bkvideofilters"> </a>

This is a per-user policy. This setting controls whether users can customize their video background in a meeting.

Currently, you can only use PowerShell to set this policy. You can edit an existing Teams meeting policy by using the [Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamsmeetingpolicy) cmdlet. Or, create a new Teams meeting policy by using the [New-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/new-csteamsmeetingpolicy) cmdlet, and then assign the policy to users.

To specify whether users can customize their video background in a meeting, set the **VideoFiltersMode** parameter as follows:

|Setting value in PowerShell |Behavior  |
|---------|---------|
|**NoFilters**     |User can't customize their video background.|
|**BlurOnly**     |User has the option to blur their video background. |
|**BlurandDefaultBackgrounds**     |User has the option to blur their video background or choose from the default set of images to use as their background. |
|**AllFilters**     |Use has the option to blur their video background, choose from the default set of images, or upload custom images to use as their background. |

> [!NOTE]
> Images uploaded by users aren't screened by Teams. When you use the **AllFilters** setting, you should have internal organization policies to prevent users from uploading offensive or inappropriate images, or images your organization don't have rights to use for Teams meeting backgrounds.
