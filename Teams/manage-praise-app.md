# Manage the Praise app in the Microsoft Teams admin center

## Overview of Praise

The Praise app in Microsoft Teams helps users show appreciation to members of your organization or classroom. The badges in Praise are designed to help recognize the effort that goes into the wide range of work that Teams users do, from educators to frontline workers. To learn more, check out [Send Praise to people](https://support.microsoft.com/office/send-praise-to-people-50f26b47-565f-40fe-8642-5ca2a5ed261e).

Admins must have a Teams license to access this feature. If you try to access this feature without a Teams license, you'll get an error message.

> [!NOTE]
> The Praise app is available for GCC or GCC High cloud environments, but not for DoD.

## Enable or disable Praise in your organization

Praise is enabled by default for all Teams users in your organization. You can turn off or turn on the app at the org level on the [Manage apps](manage-apps.md) page in the Microsoft Teams admin center.

:::image type="content" source="media/manage-praise-app-admin-center.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Praise app details page in the Teams admin center, showing the Status toggle.":::

1. In the left pane of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Teams apps** > **Manage apps**.
2. In the list of apps, search for the Praise app, select it, and then switch the **Status** toggle to **Blocked** or **Allowed**.

Keep in mind that this setting affects both the Praise app and the Praise feature in the Viva Insights app in Teams.

If you set the status to **Blocked**, the Praise app is blocked within a few minutes for Teams. However, Praise in Viva Insights can take up to 15 days to be blocked.

## Enable or disable Praise for specific users in your organization

To allow or block specific users in your organization from using Praise, make sure Praise is turned on for your organization on the [Manage apps](manage-apps.md) page. Then create a custom policy for app permissions and assign it to those users. To learn more, see [Manage app permission policies in Teams](teams-app-permission-policies.md).

## Composer

Teams users in your organization can use the praise composer to recognize their peers for going above and beyond with their work. While crafting their message, they can pick from 14 titles&mdash;like **Courage**, **Optimism**, **Kind heart**, and **Creative**&mdash;to recognize their colleaguesâ€™ contributions.

## User data in Praise

Praise uses Viva Insights to process and store data. See the [Personal insights FAQ](/viva/insights/personal/overview/mya-faq) to learn more about how Viva Insights processes and stores user data.

## Give feedback or report an issue

To send feedback, select the **Help** option at bottom of the Teams left navigation bar, and then select **Report a Problem**. Select **Other**, and then enter your feedback or details about the issue you're experiencing. Indicate at the beginning of your feedback report that you're sending feedback about "Praise" so we can easily identify Praise issues.
