Best practices for user feedback methods in Microsoft Teams
===========================================================

The adoption of a new collaboration experience is about changing the behavior of your users. Human change requires training, encouragement and positive examples. It is also critical for people to feel heard during the transition. If you have previously established successful feedback methods in your organization, consider expanding them to include your Teams implementation. If you have not done this before, consider one of the following approaches:

-   Creating a public team within Microsoft Teams that any user can join to provide feedback on their experience (keeping in mind that public groups is limited to 5000 users).

-   Using Yammer to provide an open community for best practices and support for the experience.

Community-driven feedback methods require champions and service owners to be engaged. We recommend creating a monitoring schedule that rotates amongst these members. One best practices, is to create a separate team within Microsoft Teams as a place where these champions can collaborate, share resources, and best practices before sharing these with the broader team. The champions perform an advisory role to users adopting the new service, provide a friendly, human face to the change and collaborate with other members of your deployment team to raise and resolve issues.

Showcases
---------

As you continue along this journey, you will find showcases in your own environment of employees whose creativity with Microsoft Teams will surprise and delight you. We recommend that you share these showcases broadly. This will encourage others to be innovative, educate users who may be earlier in the adoption curve and reward those who’ve taken the time to think through how to best use Microsoft Teams in their environment. Setting a measurable goal of identifying a set number of showcases each quarter is helpful in maintaining your adoption momentum.
