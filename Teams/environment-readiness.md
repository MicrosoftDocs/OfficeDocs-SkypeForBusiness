Check your environment’s readiness for Microsoft Teams
===========================================

The transition to the cloud will vary by each organization, and current state may have an impact on how Teams will function.

Educational institutions are strongly encouraged to [deploy School Data Sync](https://docs.microsoft.com/schooldatasync/) before deploying Microsoft Teams. School Data Sync uses your school’s SIS roster data to automatically create classes and groups for Microsoft Teams and other applications.

To get the best experience on Teams, your organization must have deployed Exchange Online and SharePoint Online. You must also ensure that your current environment is ready for Teams.  Refer to these links for help:

-   If your organization has not deployed any Office 365 workloads, see [Getting Started with Office 365 for business.](https://support.office.com/article/Get-started-with-Office-365-for-Business-d6466f0d-5d13-464a-adcb-00906ae87029)

-   If your organization has not added or configured a verified domain for Office 365, see [Verify your Office 365 domain](https://support.office.com/article/Verify-your-Office-365-domain-to-prove-ownership-nonprofit-or-education-status-or-to-activate-Yammer-87d1844e-aa47-4dc0-a61b-1b773fd4e590).

-   If your organization has not synchronized identities to Azure Active Directory, see [Identity models and authentication in Microsoft Teams](identify-models-authentication.md).

-   If your organization does not have Exchange Online, see [Understand how Exchange and Microsoft Teams interact](Exchange-Teams-interact.md).

-   If your organization does not have SharePoint Online, see [Understand how SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business interact with Microsoft Teams](SharePoint-OneDrive-interact.md).

- If your organization is an educational institution and you use a Student Information System (SIS), [deploy School Data Sync](https://docs.microsoft.com/schooldatasync/) before deploying Microsoft Teams.

- If your organization has an existing on-premises Skype for Business Server (or Lync Server) deployment, you must configure Azure AD Connect to synchronize your on-premises directory with Office 365.  For more information, see [Configure Azure AD Connect for Teams and Skype for Business](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/hybrid/configure-azure-ad-connect).
