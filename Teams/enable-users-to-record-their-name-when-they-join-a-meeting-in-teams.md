# Enable users to record their name when they join a meeting in Microsoft Teams

When you are setting up Audio Conferencing in Microsoft 365 or Office 365, you will receive phone numbers and what is called an audio conferencing bridge. A conferencing bridge can contain one or more phone numbers that can be a dedicated or shared phone number.
  
The conferencing bridge answers a call for a user who is dialing in to a meeting using a phone. The conferencing bridge answers the caller with voice prompts from an auto attendant, and then, depending on their settings, can play notifications, ask callers to record their name, and set up the PIN security for meeting organizers. PINs are given to meeting organizers to allow them to start a meeting. However, you can set it up so a PIN isn't required to start a meeting.

## Set whether callers should record their name

Using the Microsoft Teams admin center:

1. In the left navigation, go to **Meetings** > **Conference Bridges**.

2. At the top of the **Conference Bridges** page, click **Bridge settings**.

3. Enable or disable **Meeting entry and exit notifications**.

4. If enabling notifications, choose **Names or phone numbers** under **Entry/exit announcement type**, and then turn on **Ask callers to record their name before joining a meeting.**

5. Click **Save**.

## Want to know more about Windows PowerShell?

Windows PowerShell is all about managing users and what users are allowed or not allowed to do. With Windows PowerShell, you can manage Microsoft 365 or Office 365 using a single point of administration that can simplify your daily work when you have multiple tasks to do. To get started with Windows PowerShell, see these topics:

- [Why you need to use Office 365 PowerShell](/microsoft-365/enterprise/why-you-need-to-use-microsoft-365-powershell)

- [Best ways to manage Office 365 with Windows PowerShell](/previous-versions//dn568025(v=technet.10))

For more information about Windows PowerShell, see the [Microsoft Teams PowerShell reference](/powershell/module/teams/?view=teams-ps) for more information.
