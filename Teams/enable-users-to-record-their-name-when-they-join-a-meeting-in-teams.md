# Enable users to record their name when they join a meeting in Microsoft Teams

When you are setting up Audio Conferencing in Office 365, you will receive phone numbers and what is called an audio conferencing bridge. A conferencing bridge can contain one or more phone numbers that can be a dedicated or shared phone number.
  
The conferencing bridge answers a call for a user who is dialing in to a meeting using a phone. The conferencing bridge answers the caller with voice prompts from an auto attendant, and then, depending on their settings, can play notifications, ask callers to record their name, and set up the PIN security for meeting organizers. PINs are given to meeting organizers to allow them to start a meeting. However, you can set it up so a PIN isn't required to start a meeting.

  
## Set whether callers should record their name

3. Enable or disable **Meeting entry and exit notifications**.

4. If enabling notifications, choose **Names or phone numbers** under **Entry/exit announcement type**, and then turn on **Ask callers to record their name before joining a meeting.**
