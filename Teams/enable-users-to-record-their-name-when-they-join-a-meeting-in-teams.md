# Enable users to record their name when they join a meeting in Microsoft Teams

When you set up Audio Conferencing in Microsoft 365 or Office 365, you get phone numbers for your users through an audio conferencing bridge. A conferencing bridge can have one or more phone numbers that are included at the bottom of the meeting invite. These phone numbers allow users to join Microsoft Teams meetings by dialing in.

As an admin, you can manage whether callers who dial in can record their name before joining a meeting.

## Manage whether callers can record their name in the Teams admin center

Using the Microsoft Teams admin center:

1. Navigate to **Meetings** > **Conference Bridges**.

2. At the top of the **Conference Bridges** page, select **Bridge settings**.

3. Enable or disable **Meeting entry and exit notifications**.

4. If enabling entry and exit notifications, choose **Names or phone numbers** for **Entry/exit announcement type**, and then toggle **Ask callers to record their name before joining a meeting** to **On**.

5. Select **Save**.

## Turn on or off entry and exit announcements with PowerShell

To turn entry and exit announcements on or off with PowerShell, use the **`-EnableNameRecording`** parameter within the PowerShell CsOnlineDialInConferencingTenantSettings cmdlet.

For CsOnlineDialInConferencingBridge script examples, see [Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingBridge](/powershell/module/teams/Set-csonlinedialinconferencingtenantsettings).
