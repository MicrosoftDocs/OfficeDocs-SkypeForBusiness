# Define my success

This article gives an overview of the requirements for defining success for the deployment of Audio Conferencing for your organization. By properly defining what success looks like, you can measure your results as you progress through your deployment and verify that the outcomes you achieve are the ones you wanted.

## Define business use cases for Audio Conferencing

Audio Conferencing provides organizations with additional entry points to any meetings (ad hoc or scheduled) by allowing meeting participants to join via public switched telephone network (PSTN) by dialing in using traditional landline, PBX, or mobile phones.

This is useful when the organizer or participants aren’t in front of a computer, or when data connections are unavailable or too unreliable to support voice communications—such as in a remote area with spotty mobile data coverage, or connected to a free, public Wi-Fi service with limited bandwidth, or when meeting participants prefer to dial in to the meeting by using a telephony endpoint that’s readily accessible to them.

To begin with, core project stakeholders need to define business use cases that support the implementation of Audio Conferencing.

Business use cases are meant to define and document expected and measurable business outcomes, and include the following:

-   Description of the current business process

-   Challenges with the existing business process

-   How technology can help overcome these challenges

-   The expected and measurable business outcomes if these challenges are overcome

> [!TIP]
> The following is an example of a completed business use case:
> 
> |         |
> |---------|
> |**Description of current business process**<br>Contoso currently relies on PSTN conferencing services provided by the incumbent local telephony provider chargeable by meeting minutes for internal meetings and meetings involving external parties.|
> |**Challenges with existing business process**<br>Contoso spends roughly USD 1 million per year for the current PSTN conferencing service, with 75% of the cost incurred for internal meetings. The use of traditional telephony endpoints to join the meetings hosted by the PSTN conferencing service isn’t aligned with the plan for the organization to adopt Teams as a modern communications and collaboration platform.|
> |**How technology can overcome these challenges**<br>With the adoption of Microsoft Teams as a modern communications and collaboration platform, internal users are expected to primarily join meetings by using their PCs equipped with optimized headsets and meeting-room devices. The Audio Conferencing service will be available to support external participants or to support situations where the use of PC audio isn’t favorable for the internal participants.|
> |**Expected, measurable, business outcomes**<br>The move to Teams as a modern communications and collaboration platform, combined with the Audio Conferencing service, will greatly reduce the cost to deliver the PSTN conferencing service.|

In addition to defining your business use cases, to set the project boundaries you should aim to drive clarity around:

-   **Organizational scope:** The implementation of Audio Conferencing might encompass the whole organization or just specific business units.

-   **Project timeline:** The specific timeline the project will run.

## Identify key stakeholders

The business use cases defined in the previous step include an organizational scope for the Audio Conferencing implementation, and based on that, you can complete the comprehensive stakeholder matrix to include the right people to involve in the project.

## Define OKRs, KSIs, and risks

With the project stakeholders assembled, you can translate business use cases, organizational scope, and project timelines into objectives and key results (OKRs), and the measures of project success can be defined as a list of key success indicators (KSIs).

Full participation from project stakeholders in defining OKRs and KSIs is essential to help ensure they feel a sense of ownership and align these measures of success to organizational business requirements.

OKRs contain the objectives you set in the beginning of the project, and you define measurable key results on a quarterly basis. You review key results monthly to track the status of the overall project, and—based on progress—you adjust quarterly plans as needed.

> [!TIP]
> Example of OKRs relevant to Audio Conferencing implementation can be referenced below:
> <br>
> 
> **Vision: Increase productivity by maximizing Office 365 investments**
> 
> |Objectives  |Key Results  |To Do  |
> |---------|---------|---------|
> |Deploy Audio Conferencing in Teams by end of fiscal year 2018|FY18Q1: Deploy Audio Conferencing in Teams globally|Envision<ul><li>Create success plan</li><li>Create detailed technical implementation plan</li></ul><p>Onboard<ul><li>Execute success plan</li><li>Execute technical implementation plan</li></ul>|
> |Decommission legacy PSTN Conferencing service globally by mid of fiscal year 2018|FY18Q2: Decommission legacy PSTN Conferencing service globally|Drive Value<ul><li>Boost user engagement and drive adoption</li><li>Manage and prepare change</li><li>Measure, share success, and iterate</li>|

KSIs measure quality and success of the key results, and complement the binary nature of OKRs (achieved or not achieved) by detailing good and/or bad results.

When defining KSIs, we recommend that you use “specific, measurable, assignable, realistic, time-related” (SMART) criteria:

-   Specific: target a specific area for improvement

-   Measurable: quantify, or at least suggest an indicator of, progress

-   Assignable: specify who will do it

-   Realistic: state what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources

-   Time-related: specify when the results can be achieved

> [!TIP]
> The following is an example of KSI relevant to this project:
> 
> |Type  |KSI question & criteria  |How measured  |Success criteria  |Measured  |Responsible  |
> |---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
> |Usage/adoption|Call quality is equal to or better than the previous solution|Survey|80% of users agree or strongly agree|After enablement and quarterly|Information Technology team|
> |Usage/adoption|Microsoft Teams made the communication process easier|Survey|80% of users agree or strongly agree|After enablement and quarterly|Change Management team|
> |Usage/adoption|Users actively use the solution|Office 365 reports, Call Quality Dashboard|80% of users are active daily users|Daily|Change Management team|
> |Usage/quality|Percentage of poor calls/conferences should be minimal|Call Quality Dashboard|< 5% of poor calls per month|Daily|Information Technology team|
> |Usage/support|I know how to get technical support|Survey|90% of users agree or strongly agree|After enablement and quarterly|Change Management team|
> |Usage/support|I am satisfied with the quality of technical support|Survey|80% of users agree or strongly agree|After each incident|Information Technology team|
> |Financial|Reduction of legacy conferencing minutes|Financial system|Meet defined ROI|Based on ROI|Change Management team|

You need to identify business risks as part of this exercise, and define a mitigation plan for each identified risk. This information can be captured into a risks register.

> [!TIP]
> Your risk register can be documented as the example below:
> 
> |Risk  |Likelihood  |Impact  |Overall  |Mitigation plan  |
> |---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
> |Upcoming merger will add up to 1,000 people|High|High|High|<ul><li>For merged companies, create a separate OKR that applies to their own project phases (Envision, Onboard, Drive Value)</li><li>Don’t include these OKRs in existing OKRs</li></ul>|
> |Telephone number porting will delay project completion|High|High|High|<ul><li>Prepare all the information required to support telephone number porting ahead of time (customer service record, billing details, Letter of Authorization)</li><li>Adjust the project timeline to accommodate the turnaround time of telephone number porting execution</li><li>Communicate the use of new dial-in conferencing numbers to external participants</li></ul>|
> |Planned network redesign|High|Medium|Medium|<ul><li>Before implementing Teams as a modern communications and collaboration platform, conduct a network readiness assessment for sites in scope of the project</li></ul>|

## Establish a steering committee

A steering committee is a governing group of key stakeholders and project leaders who have been brought together to guide a project or program toward its defined business outcomes. The steering committee isn’t directly responsible for *how* the project is delivered, but rather *what* the project delivers to the business.

Every project requires an agreed-on vision and charter. To deliver the outcomes you want from the project, the vision must be clearly defined, and it needs to be monitored and maintained. This becomes the responsibility of the steering committee: to drive decisions, advise, provide strategic oversight, to serve as advocates to the organization for the project’s initiatives, and—when necessary—remove blockers.

Your organization should put significant thought into the formation of the steering committee. The committee must ensure that the project achieves the business objectives you’ve defined for driving change throughout the organization, meet periodically to discuss the current pulse of the project, and help unblock any obstacles that are encountered along the way.

The committee should define its charter to include some key objectives:

-   Keep a strong alignment between the project team and the executive sponsor or executive leadership.

-   Provide insight into the status of the project to the executive sponsor or executive leadership.

-   Allow the executive sponsor or executive leadership team to provide direction and input to the project and ensure that it aligns with overarching business goals, by adjusting project plans, objective key results (OKRs), and other project activities.

The steering committee meets at a recurring interval throughout the lifetime of a project to ensure alignment between the organizational leadership and the project team. This critical meeting ensures that the direction of the project has leadership’s full support and incorporates any feedback provided by leadership into the project to drive success. The committee uses these meetings to gain insight into project status, and to:

-   Agree on business outcomes that align to the business case, and to ensure the project is driving towards delivery of these outcomes.

-   Check and approve the project for accuracy and compliance with the business case.

-   Review and verify changes made to the business case that could affect any defined outcomes.

-   Make strategic decisions regarding the prioritization of project deliverables, and approve interim deliverables.

-   Identify, manage, and mitigate gaps, risks, and issues where additional influence is required from the committee.

-   Gather support from the executive sponsor or executive leadership team for issues that require escalation, prioritizing and resolving any conflicts between stakeholder business units. 

-   Provide formal feedback and recommendations to executive leadership, the change advisory board, or other business and IT stakeholders, as applicable.
