# Optimize feedback and reporting for your Microsoft Teams adoption

Ensure that you are getting signals back from your service and your employees by following our best practices for user feedback and service health reporting.  In some cases, you may need administrator rights to access certain service usage and health reports. If you are not the Microsoft 365 or Office 365 administrator for your organization, work with that individual to be granted the report reader role in the Microsoft 365 admin center to access some of this data.

## Incorporating feedback 

Throughout your experiment phase you will be capturing information about how people have used the product and their experience. Use this information now to adjust your awareness and training programs as you plan to expand its use across your business units. Some common example questions might be:

- When do I use this new tool alongside my existing technology?
- Who is approved to use this tool with me?
- Is it safe for highly confidential information? 
- Who do I speak with to learn more about Microsoft Teams?
- Something's not working. How do I get help?

## Invest in your champions

As you prepare to scale your usage of Microsoft Teams, recruit additional champions in each business unit or group you are expanding to. Enroll these enthusiastic people in your service training program, and standardize how and when you meet with them.
 
Be clear in your champions program design what your employees will get and what they are expected to give if they become champions. Common program requirements are scheduled office hours, participation in monthly community calls, and participation in internal online communities to support your transition to these new experiences.  

Best Practice: Hold a monthly Teams meeting for your internal champions. Split your agenda between teaching new features, addressing feedback, and providing self service tools for your employee community.

Best Practice: Have representatives from your internal support department or IT Helpdesk join your champions community to stay up to date on new information about your Teams usage. 

## Service reporting

There are three types of reporting you should review as you deploy and adopt Microsoft Teams:

- [Service health](https://status.office365.com/) – from Microsoft 365, Office 365, and your internal IT support department.
- [Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/activity-reports) – from Microsoft 365 or Office 365 view [Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Microsoft Teams user activity](/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/activity-reports). You may also use information from other systems within your organization.
- Service satisfaction – Gathered from internal community forums and surveys on specific experiences
