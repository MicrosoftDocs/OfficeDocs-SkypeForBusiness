# Office 365 ProPlus

If you have already purchased the [Office 365 ProPlus](https://products.office.com/en/business/office-365-proplus-business-software) plan, here are the add-on licenses you need to buy to get more Teams features.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although Audio Conferencing, Phone System, and Calling Plans can be purchased to enable voice calling features, we recommend that you evaluate an Enterprise E5 plan to see if it is more cost effective.
