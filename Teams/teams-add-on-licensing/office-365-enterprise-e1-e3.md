# Office 365 Enterprise E1 and E3

If you have already purchased the [Office 365 Enterprise E1](https://products.office.com/en-us/business/office-365-enterprise-e1-business-software) or [E3](https://products.office.com/en-us/business/office-365-enterprise-e3-business-software) plan, here are the add-on licenses you need to buy to get more Microsoft Teams features.

|To add this feature|Here's what you need to do|
|:------------------|:--------------------------|
|Audio Conferencing <br/> <br/> |Buy the **Audio Conferencing add-on**. <br/>Buy 1 Audio Conferencing license for each person who is going to schedule or host a dial-in meeting. Attendees do not need licenses.<br/> Once you buy the license, Microsoft will be your audio conferencing provider. |
|Toll-free numbers for dial-in access to your meetings, and the ability to dial out from a meeting to add someone by calling any telephone number in the world<br/> | Buy [Communications Credits](../add-funds-and-manage-communications-credits.md).|
|Phone System <br/> |<ol><li>Buy the Office 365 Phone System add-on. </li><li>Buy a [Calling Plan](../calling-plans-for-office-365.md) for Office 365.</li></ul>Or, use the [telephone service from your existing provider](microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md#bkmk_existing).  <br/> |
|Cloud Voicemail<br/> |For E1 plans, buy Exchange Online Plan 2. <br/>Or, switch to an Office Suite that comes with Exchange Online Plan 2, such as Office 365 E3. |
|Calling Plans<br/> |<ol><li>Buy the Phone System add-on.</li><li>Buy a [Calling Plan](../calling-plans-for-office-365.md): you can only buy this after you buy the **Phone System** add-on.</li></ol> <br/> |
   
  
## E1 and E3 customers: How to see prices and buy
<a name="bkmk_buypremium"> </a>

1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center.

2. Go to **Billing** > **Purchase services** > **Add-on subscriptions**

3. You'll see the Phone System add-on. Select **Buy now**. 

After you buy a Phone System license, you'll see the price and option to buy a Calling Plan.

### Partners: How to see prices and buy
<a name="bkmk_partners"> </a>

The E3 plan is part of your Action Pack. To buy the Phone System and Audio Conferencing add-ons:

1. Buy one seat of E3 from our [marketing website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=24393). Choose the option to add the seat to your existing tenant.

2. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center and go to **Billing** > **Purchase services** > **Add-on subscriptions**.

    Now you'll see the prices and option to buy the Phone System and Audio Conferencing add-ons.

## Why don't I see the option to buy add-ons?
<a name="bkmk_how"> </a>

In a few situations, you won't see the option to buy Microsoft Teams add-ons in the Microsoft 365 admin center:

- **You purchased Office 365 Business Premium through GoDaddy**. In this case, you can't buy Microsoft Teams add-ons. You need to switch to the E3 plan (which GoDaddy doesn't sell), and then you can buy them.

- **You have a monthly commitment instead of an annual commitment**. In some cases, customers who have a monthly commitment can't buy the add-ons (this is different from the payment method, which can be monthly). This is a known issue that we are fixing.
