# Assign Teams add-on licenses to users

Add-on licenses are licenses for specific Teams capabilities like Audio Conferencing, Phone System, and Calling Plans. This article describes how to assign add-on licenses to individual users and large sets of users in bulk.

> [!NOTE]
> See [Teams add-on licensing](./microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md) for Teams capabilities that are available with add-on licenses. You'll also find information about which licenses you need to buy and how to buy them, depending on your plan. After you decide which capabilities you want for your users, assign the licenses to them.

You can use the Microsoft 365 admin center or PowerShell to assign licenses to users in your organization. You must be a Global admin or User management admin to manage licenses.

## What you need to know before you assign Phone System, Calling Plan, and Communication Credits licenses

Before you get started, review the following requirements:

- If you're using on-premises Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) connectivity for users, you only need to assign a Teams Phone Standard license. Do NOT assign a Calling Plan license.

- After assigning a Microsoft Calling Plan to a user, it can take up to 24 hours before they'll see the dial pad in their Teams client. If the dial pad isn't shown in 24 hours, check your [dial pad configuration](../dial-pad-configuration.md). If necessary, you can also [contact support](https://support.office.com/article/32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b).

- You'll get an error message if you haven't purchased the correct number of licenses. If you need to buy more Calling Plan licenses, choose the option to buy more.

- Even if your users are assigned Enterprise E5 licenses, you still need to connect them to the PSTN. You have several [PSTN connectivity options](../pstn-connectivity.md), including Microsoft Teams Calling Plans, Direct Routing, or Operator Connect.

- After you assign Calling Plan or Communication Credits licenses to your users, you'll need to get phone numbers for your organization, and then assign those numbers to users. For step-by-step instructions, see [Set up Calling Plans](../set-up-calling-plans.md).

## Using the Microsoft 365 admin center

Use the Microsoft 365 admin center to assign licenses to individual users or small sets of users at a time.

You assign licenses on the **Licenses** page (for up to 20 users at a time) or the **Active users** page (for up to 40 users at a time). The method you choose depends on whether you want to manage product licenses for specific users or manage user licenses for specific products.

For step-by-step instructions, see [Assign licenses to users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users).

If you need to assign licenses for a large number of users, such as hundreds or thousands of users, use PowerShell or [group-based licensing in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/licensing-groups-assign).

## Using PowerShell

Use PowerShell to assign licenses to users in bulk. To learn more, see [Assign licenses to user accounts with PowerShell](/office365/enterprise/powershell/assign-licenses-to-user-accounts-with-office-365-powershell).

### Example script

Here's an example of how to use a script to assign licenses to your users.

1. [Install the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell](/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-msonlinev1).
2. At the Windows PowerShell command prompt, run the following script to assign licenses to your users, where `CompanyName:License` is your organization name and the identifier for the license that you want to assign. For example, `litwareinc:MCOMEETADV`.

    The identifier is different than the friendly name of the license. For example, the identifier for Audio Conferencing is `MCOMEETADV`. To learn more, see [Product names and SKU identifiers for licensing](#product-names-and-sku-identifiers-for-licensing).

    ```powershell
    #Create a text file with a single column that lists the user principal names (UPNs) of users to assign licenses to. The MSOL service uses the UPN to license user accounts.
    #Example of text file:''
    #user1@domain.com
    #user2@domain.com

    #Import Module
    ipmo MSOnline

    #Authenticate to MSOLservice
    Connect-MSOLService
    #File prompt to select the userlist txt file
    [System.Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName("System.windows.forms") | Out-Null
      $OFD = New-Object System.Windows.Forms.OpenFileDialog
      $OFD.filter = "text files (*.*)| *.txt"
      $OFD.ShowDialog() | Out-Null
      $OFD.filename

    If ($OFD.filename -eq '')
    {
    Write-Host "You did not choose a file. Try again" -ForegroundColor White -BackgroundColor Red
    }

    #Create a variable of all users
    $users = Get-Content $OFD.filename

    #License each user in the $users variable
    foreach ($user in $users)
        {
        Write-host "Assigning License: $user"
        Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName $user -AddLicenses "<CompanyName:License>" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
        Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName $user -AddLicenses "<CompanyName:License>" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
        }
    ```

    For example, to assign Microsoft 365 Enterprise E1 and Audio Conferencing licenses, use the following syntax in the script:

      ```powershell
      Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName $user -AddLicenses "litwareinc:ENTERPRISEPACK" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
      Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName $user -AddLicenses "litwareinc:MCOMEETADV" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
      ```

    To assign a Teams Phone with Calling Plan license, use the following syntax in the script:

      ```powershell
      Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName $user -AddLicenses "litwareinc:MCOTEAMS_ESSENTIALS" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
      ```

## Product names and SKU identifiers for licensing
