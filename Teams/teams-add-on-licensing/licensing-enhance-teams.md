## Are there previous Teams features that moved to Teams Premium?

With the general release of Teams Premium on February 1, 2023, the following Teams features moved from Teams to Teams Premium.

- Live translation of meeting captions.
- PPT live chapters.
- Timeline markers in Teams meeting recordings for when a user left or joined meetings.
- Custom organization Together mode scenes.
- Virtual Appointments: SMS notifications.
- Virtual Appointments: Organizational analytics in the Teams admin center.
- Virtual Appointments: Scheduled queue view.

## What are the requirements to purchase Teams Premium?

At release, Teams Premium will be available to purchase worldwide through all Microsoft purchasing channels, including EA, EAS, CSP, Web Direct, NCE - Customer led, and NCE - Partner led.

Before you can purchase Teams Premium licenses for your users, ensure your tenant and users meet the requirements.

The **tenant requirement** is:

- Must be a commercial, worldwide public sector, EDU, GCC, or non-profit tenant at general release.
  - Teams Premium for GCC became available on March 1, 2023.
  - At general release, Microsoft won't offer an EDU-specific license or EDU discounts for Teams Premium.
  - GCC High and DoD licenses will become available sometime after the general release.

The **user requirement** is:

- An Office 365 or Microsoft 365 subscription with Teams.

### Can I acquire Teams Premium features without the Teams Premium license?

Teams Premium bundles a large set of Teams features under a single license. There are instances where a single Teams Premium feature could be acquired through other licensing scenarios. However, the Teams Premium license is designed to be the most holistic and simplest avenue to enhance your organization's and users' Teams experience.

## Which users should be assigned Teams Premium licenses?

Teams Premium is licensed on a per-user subscription basis and is subject to the [Universal Terms for Online Services](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/ForOnlineServices/all). You should plan to assign a Teams Premium user subscription license to every user you want to provide Teams Premium features for.

> [!NOTE]
> When the organizer of a Teams meeting or live event is licensed for Teams Premium, the *Live translation (for captions)*, *advanced Meetings protection*, and *advanced Webinars* features are extended to all meeting participants, including external and guest users.
>
> External participants in Virtual Appointments don't require a Teams Premium license to benefit from Teams Premium advanced Virtual Appointments.
>
> All meeting participants must be licensed for Teams Premium to benefit from the *Intelligent recap* feature.

## How does Teams Premium differ from Teams Rooms Pro?

Teams Premium licenses are assigned to your organization's users, and Teams Rooms Pro licenses should only be assigned to Microsoft Teams Rooms devices. These two licenses aren't dependent on one another, don't overlap features, and won't cause license enforcement conflicts.

Before the release of Teams Rooms Pro, Microsoft offered a Teams Rooms license called Teams Rooms Premium. Teams Rooms Premium has been retired and isn't related to Teams Premium.

## Can I experience Teams Premium before buying licenses?

Starting in December 2022, organizations can try Teams Premium by purchasing the zero-cost Teams Premium 30-day trial license available in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=868433).

Organizations with a Teams Premium trial license will have 25 licenses to assign to users. Those 25 users can experience and test Teams Premium features as they become available. Also, the admin can manage Teams Premium features for the 25 licensed users.

Most organization segments can purchase and use the Teams Premium trial license, excluding GCC High and DoD tenants.

### What will happen if my users' trial licenses expire?

After the 30-day trial licenses expire, the 25 licensed users will lose all Teams Premium functionality. There's currently no grace period between the expiration of the trial license and the loss of functionality.

For this reason, we recommend organizations plan their Teams Premium trial period, ensuring all necessary test scenarios are thoroughly vetted before the trial period expires.

When the trial licenses expire, the tenant's uploaded Teams Premium assets like custom templates and meeting backgrounds will remain in the tenant but will be grayed out and unusable.

If your organization wishes to keep Teams Premium features after the trial period, you'll need to purchase Teams Premium licenses when they become available and reassign the licenses to your users.

## How do I purchase Teams Premium licenses?

If your tenant and users meet [the requirements for Teams Premium](#what-are-the-requirements-to-purchase-teams-premium), you can purchase Teams Premium add-on licenses through your preferred purchasing channel once Teams Premium becomes generally available.

After you purchase your Teams Premium licenses, you'll assign the licenses to your users in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834822). It can take up to 24 hours before the assignment takes effect.

For instructions on assigning licenses in the Microsoft 365 admin center, see [Assign Microsoft 365 licenses to users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users).

## Is admin configuration required after assigning users licenses?

Many Teams Premium features require an IT admin to configure the feature before users can access the feature.

The following list indicates Teams Premium features that require admin configuration in the [Teams admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2066851) before users can access the feature:

- Using end-to-end encryption on meetings up to 50 participants.
- Adding watermarks to meetings.
- Adding sensitivity labels.
- Preventing copy and paste in meeting chats.
- Using organization customized backgrounds.
- Using organization customized Together mode scenes.
  - Admin must create the custom Together mode scene.
- Being assigned a custom policy package.
- Using organization customized meeting templates.
- Seeing organization customized branding.
- Using eCDN for Live Events.
- Using RTMP-In.
- Customizing Virtual Appointment lobby rooms with branding.
