# Microsoft Teams Premium licensing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Teams Premium licenses *are not* a replacement for Teams licenses. Users must have both a Teams license and a Teams Premium license for Teams and Teams Premium features to work properly. For more information on Teams Premium requirements, see [What are the requirements to purchase Teams Premium?](#what-are-the-requirements-to-purchase-teams-premium).

Microsoft Teams Premium is a Teams add-on license that allows organizations with Microsoft 365 subscriptions to enhance their Teams experience with benefits like:

- More personalized and intelligent meetings, webinars, and town halls.
- Enhanced protection for meetings.
- Advanced management and reporting capabilities for IT.
- Advanced Virtual Appointments.

## How does Teams Premium compare to Teams?

Purchasing the Teams Premium add-on license provides admins and end users with extra features on top Teams along with their Microsoft 365 subscription.

The following tables compare key features between Teams and Teams Premium. Because Teams Premium is an add-on license to Teams, users need Teams and Teams Premium licenses to access all features listed in the following table. Teams Premium licenses don't replace users' standard Teams licenses.

- PPT live chapters.
- Timeline markers in Teams meeting recordings for when a user left or joined meetings.
- Custom organization Together mode scenes.
- Virtual Appointments: SMS notifications.
- Virtual Appointments: Organizational analytics in the Teams admin center.
- Virtual Appointments: Scheduled queue view.

## What are the requirements to purchase Teams Premium?

Teams Premium is available to purchase worldwide through all Microsoft purchasing channels, including EA, EAS, CSP, Web Direct, NCE - Customer led, and NCE - Partner led.

Before you can purchase Teams Premium licenses for your users, ensure your tenant and users meet the requirements.

The **tenant requirement** is:

- Must be a commercial, worldwide public sector, EDU, GCC, GCC High, DoD, or non-profit tenant.
  - Currently, Microsoft doesn't offer an EDU-specific license or EDU discounts for Teams Premium.

The **user requirement** is:

- An Office 365 or Microsoft 365 subscription and a Teams license.
  - For new customers, Teams licenses must be purchased separately from Office 365/Microsoft 365 licenses, but both licenses are still required for Teams Premium.

### Can I acquire Teams Premium features without the Teams Premium license?

Teams Premium bundles a large set of advanced Teams features under a single license. There are instances where a single Teams Premium feature could be acquired through other licensing scenarios. However, the Teams Premium license is designed to be the most holistic and simplest avenue to enhance your organization's and users' Teams experiences.

## Which users should be assigned Teams Premium licenses?

Teams Premium is licensed on a per-user subscription basis and is subject to the [Universal Terms for Online Services](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/ForOnlineServices/all). You should plan to assign a Teams Premium user subscription license to every user you want to provide Teams Premium features for.

### Which features are applied to organizers, attendees/users, or admins?

A user's Teams experience depends on their Teams license and their event role. Teams checks a user’s license and role feature by feature to deliver the appropriate experience.

For example, in a Teams meeting, Teams checks each users’ type of Teams license and whether they're a meeting organizer or attendee. These factors determine a user’s experience and potentially other attendees’ experience during the meeting.

- **Organizer-based features:** Some Teams Premium features are applied at the organizer level. If an event organizer has a Teams Premium license, the organizer-based features are shared and made accessible to the attendees only during the event.

> [!NOTE]
> If an organizer with a Teams Premium license appoints a delegate to create their meetings, the delegate doesn't need a Teams Premium license for organizer-based features to work.

- **Attendee-based features:** Some Teams Premium features are applied at the attendee/user level. These Teams Premium features aren't shared or made accessible to other attendees during the event and only benefit the Teams Premium licensed users.
- **Admin-based features:** Some Teams Premium features primarily benefit an organization's IT admins. These features are only accessible to Teams admins with a Teams Premium license.

The following table shows which Teams Premium features provide primary value to organizers, attendees, or IT admins.

| Premium Value | Features Applied at Organizer Level | Features Applied at Attendee/User Level | Features Applied at the IT Admin Level |
| ------------- | :---------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| **More intelligence** | ✔️ Live translation for captions (40 languages) | ✔️ AI-generated chapters for intelligent meeting recap recordings</br>✔️ Personalized timeline markers in meeting recordings</br> ✔️ Speaker timeline markers</br> ✔️ Intelligent speaker search in the transcript</br> ✔️ AI-generated notes and tasks | ✔️ Advanced collaboration analytics |

## How does Teams Premium differ from Teams Rooms Pro?

Teams Premium licenses are assigned to your organization's users, and Teams Rooms Pro licenses should only be assigned to Microsoft Teams Rooms devices. These two licenses aren't dependent on one another, don't overlap features, and don't cause license enforcement conflicts.

Before the release of Teams Rooms Pro, Microsoft offered a Teams Rooms license called Teams Rooms Premium. Teams Rooms Premium has gone away and isn't related to Teams Premium.

## Can I experience Teams Premium before buying licenses?

Organizations can try Teams Premium by admins purchasing the zero-cost Teams Premium 30-day trial license available in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=868433). Users can also acquire a Teams Premium self-service trial license that lasts for 60 days.

When admins purchase a Teams Premium trial license, they have 25 licenses to assign to users. Those 25 users can experience and test Teams Premium features as they become available.

Admins can manage Teams Premium features for their licensed users, whether they were acquired by the admin or users.

### How does the Teams Premium self-service trial license work?

Microsoft offers users the ability to acquire their own Teams Premium trial licenses, also referred to as self-service trial licenses.

Individuals can sign up for Teams Premium self-service trials on their organization’s existing Microsoft 365 tenants with their business sign-ins. They can try out the full functionality of the product for 60 days before requesting their admins purchase paid licenses. Individuals can start the trial directly from Microsoft Teams (Desktop and Web).

There's no requirement to input payment information when signing up for a trial. Admins maintain full control of paying for subscriptions. Admins can't sign up for self-service trials and should refer to the guidance for admins trials discussed in the following section.

These self-service trials are available worldwide. They aren't available for Government or EDU customers.

#### Can I manage my users' self-service trial licenses?

The self-service trials for Teams Premium don't compromise IT oversight or control. If you're an admin, you can use subscription management capabilities to oversee and manage trial licenses on the **Licenses** page in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842264).

For more information on enabling or disabling self-service trials for your users, see [Manage self-service purchases and trials](/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/manage-self-service-purchases-admins).

### What are the terms and conditions of the Teams Premium self-service trial?

By participating in this free trial (“Trial”) of the Microsoft 365 services, you agree to be bound by our [Product Terms](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2108910) and the following terms (“Trial Terms”), provided that in the event of a conflict the Trial Terms shall govern. The Trial period is for thirty (30) or sixty (60) days from the date you activate the Trial depending on the trial you start. Unless you purchase a subscription to the Microsoft 365 services before the expiration or termination of your Trial period, you no longer have access to (i) any data related to the features of the Trial that you entered into your account, and (ii) configurations or customizations made by you or for you using the features of the Trial. Microsoft reserves the right to terminate or modify the Trial and/or these Trial Terms at any time without prior notice and without liability. Trial offer isn't available for customers in all regions and countries.

### What happens if my users' trial licenses expire?

After the trial licenses expire, the licensed users lose all Teams Premium functionality. There's no grace period between the expiration of the trial license and the loss of functionality.

For this reason, we recommend organizations plan their Teams Premium trial period, ensuring all necessary test scenarios are thoroughly vetted before the trial period expires.

When the trial licenses expire, the tenant's uploaded Teams Premium assets like custom templates and meeting backgrounds remain in the tenant but are grayed out and unusable.

If your organization wishes to keep Teams Premium features after the trial period, you need to purchase Teams Premium licenses and reassign the licenses to your users.

## How do I purchase Teams Premium licenses?

If your tenant and users meet [the requirements for Teams Premium](#what-are-the-requirements-to-purchase-teams-premium), you can purchase Teams Premium add-on licenses through your preferred purchasing channel.

After you purchase your Teams Premium licenses, assign the licenses to your users in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834822). It can take up to 24 hours before the assignment takes effect.

For instructions on assigning licenses in the Microsoft 365 admin center, see [Assign Microsoft 365 licenses to users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users).

## Is admin configuration required after assigning users licenses?

Many Teams Premium features require an IT admin to configure the feature before users can access the feature.

The following list indicates Teams Premium features that require admin configuration in the [Teams admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2066851) before users can access the feature:

- Using end-to-end encryption on meetings up to 200 participants.
- Adding watermarks to meetings.

- Preventing copy and paste in meeting chats.
