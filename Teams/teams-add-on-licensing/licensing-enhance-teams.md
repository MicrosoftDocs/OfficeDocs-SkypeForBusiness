## Are there current Teams features that will move to Teams Premium?

With the general release of Teams Premium, some Teams features will move from Teams licenses to Teams Premium licenses. To allow your users to keep using these features, you'll need to purchase and assign Teams Premium licenses.

The features that are moving to Teams Premium are:

- Live translated captions.
- Timeline markers in Teams meeting recordings for when a user left or joined meetings.
- Custom organization Together mode scenes.
- Virtual Appointments: SMS notifications.
- Virtual Appointments: Organizational analytics in the Teams admin center.
- Virtual Appointments: Scheduled queue view.

### Is there a grace period to switch to Team Premium before my users lose functionality?

When Teams Premium becomes generally available to purchase, there will be a 30-day grace period for admins to purchase Teams Premium.

After the 30-day grace period, users will lose access to features previously available in Teams without the Teams Premium add-on, unless the admin purchases and assigns Teams Premium licenses for their users.

Some tenants may have Teams Premium trial licenses. Once the trial licenses expire, users will immediately lose Teams Premium features. Assets associated with Teams Premium features like custom templates and meeting backgrounds will remain in the tenant but will be grayed out and unusable.

## What are the requirements to purchase Teams Premium?

At release, Teams Premium will be available to purchase worldwide through all Microsoft purchasing channels, including EA, EAS, EES, CSP, Web Direct, NCE – Customer led, and NCE – Partner led.

Before you can purchase Teams Premium licenses for your users, ensure that your tenant and users meet the requirements.

The **tenant requirement** is:

- Must be a commercial, worldwide public sector, EDU, GCC, or non-profit tenant.
  - At general release, Microsoft won’t offer an EDU-specific license or EDU discounts for Teams Premium.
  - GCC High and DoD tenants won’t be able to purchase Teams Premium licenses at general release.

The **user requirement** is:

- An Office 365 or Microsoft 365 subscription with Teams.

## How does Teams Premium differ from Teams Rooms Pro?

Teams Premium licenses are assigned to your organization’s users, and Teams Rooms Pro licenses should only be assigned to Microsoft Teams Rooms devices. These two licenses aren’t dependent on one another, don’t overlap features, and won’t cause license enforcement conflicts.

Before the release of Teams Rooms Pro, Microsoft offered a Teams Rooms license called Teams Rooms Premium. Teams Rooms Premium has been retired and isn’t related to Teams Premium.

## Can I experience Teams Premium before buying licenses?

Starting in December 2022, organizations can try Teams Premium by purchasing the zero-cost Teams Premium 30-day trial license available in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=868433).

Organizations with a Teams Premium trial license will have 25 licenses to assign to users. Those 25 users can experience and test Teams Premium features as they become available. Also, the admin can manage Teams Premium features for the 25 licensed users.

Most organization segments can purchase and use the Teams Premium trial license, excluding GCC High and DoD tenants.

### What will happen if my users’ trial licenses expire?

After the 30-day trial licenses expire, the 25 licensed users will lose all Teams Premium functionality. There’s currently no grace period between the expiration of the trial license and the loss of functionality.

For this reason, we recommend organizations plan their Teams Premium trial period, ensuring all necessary test scenarios are thoroughly vetted before the trial period expires.

When the trial licenses expire, the tenant's uploaded Teams Premium assets like custom templates and meeting backgrounds will remain in the tenant but will be grayed out and unusable.

If your organization wishes to keep Teams Premium features after the trial period, you'll need to purchase Teams Premium licenses when they become available and reassign the licenses to your users.

## How do I purchase Teams Premium licenses?

If your tenant and users meet the requirements for Teams Premium, you can purchase Teams Premium add-on licenses through your preferred purchasing channel once Teams Premium becomes generally available.

After you purchase your Teams Premium licenses, you’ll assign the licenses to your users in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834822).

For instructions on assigning licenses in the Microsoft 365 admin center, see [Assign Microsoft 365 licenses to users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users).
