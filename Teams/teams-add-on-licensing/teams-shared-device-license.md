# Microsoft Teams Shared Devices licensing

Microsoft Teams can support hybrid work scenarios and enable users to work in flexible spaces. The **Microsoft Teams Shared Devices** add-on license allows offices to designate devices as shared devices, including common area phones, Teams displays for hot-desks, Teams panels for meeting spaces, and Android phones through the Teams mobile app. With this license, common area phones have the ability to join audio conferences via a dial-in number provided by the meeting organizer.

For information about other Teams add-on licenses, see [Microsoft Teams add-on licenses](/microsoftteams/teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing).
