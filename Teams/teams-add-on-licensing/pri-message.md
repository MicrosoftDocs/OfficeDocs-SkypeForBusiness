# Premium Messaging add-on licensing

The Premium Messaging SKU is available starting July 1, 2020. Premium Messaging can be added to a paid Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription that includes Microsoft Teams.

Note that Premium Messaging isn't available for US Government Community Cloud (GCC), GCC High, or Department of Defense (DoD) organizations at this time.

## Premium Messaging SKU features and capabilities

Premium Messaging for Teams includes the following features. We'll be adding more features and capabilities in the future.

### Priority notifications

As announced in June 2019, users can mark a Teams message as Urgent when they have access to the [priority notifications](https://support.office.com/article/mark-a-message-as-important-or-urgent-in-teams-ea99d5b6-1317-4550-8d75-86ff14cd4462) feature. Urgent messages sent with priority notifications notify the recipient every two minutes for a period of 20 minutes or until the recipient reads the message, maximizing the likelihood that a message is acted upon in a timely manner.

The availability of priority notifications is as follows:

- **Receive priority notifications**: All Teams users can receive unlimited priority notifications.
- **Send priority notifications**: For the remainder of the priority notifications preview trial period that ends March 31, 2020, all users who have a paid subscription that includes Teams can also send unlimited priority notifications.
Starting July 1, 2020 users who don't have the Premium Messaging add-on SKU can send priority notifications as follows:

|Segment  |Sending up to 5 messages included per user per month |
|---------|---------|
|Enterprise     |Office 365 F1 / Microsoft 365 F1<br> Office 365 E1 | Office 365 E3 / Microsoft 365 E3 <br>Office 365 E5 / Microsoft 365 E5         |
|SMB    |Office 365 Business Essentials<br>Office 365 Business Essentials|Office 365 Business Premium / Microsoft 365 Business         |

Priority notifications is available in the Premium Messaging add-on SKU today for Commercial customers only.

### Tags automatically assigned to users based on active shifts (coming soon)

With this feature, users are automatically assigned tags that match their schedule and shift group name from the Shifts app in Teams. For example:

- When a nurse types CardiologistOnCall in the **To** line in a new chat, the message is sent to all cardiologists who are scheduled in Shifts to work at that specific time.
- If a system engineer includes @FieldEngineers in their channel post, the engineers scheduled in Shifts to work during that time receive a notification about the post.

With tagging by shift, Teams takes the guesswork out of knowing the name of the on-duty staff or responsible individual when you need to quickly relay information. Tagging by shift can also be backed by major workforce management systems like JDA, Kronos, and AMiON by integrating them with Shifts in Teams.

- Be assigned to a shift-based tag: All Teams users can be assigned to a shift-based tag and receive messages as part of a shift-based tag.
- Use a shift-based tag: Only Teams users with Premium Messaging can use a shift-based tag in a chat, channel conversation, or task.
