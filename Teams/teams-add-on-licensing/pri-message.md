# Messaging policies licensing

We're hearing from customers around the globe how the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic has created new challenges as they work to handle drastic shifts in their day-to-day operations. Being able to directly and quickly connect with teammates during fast-changing conditions is essential to maintaining business continuity during the crisis response and as many of us return to the workplace.

Originally announced in June 2019, [priority notifications](https://support.microsoft.com/article/mark-a-message-as-important-or-urgent-in-teams-ea99d5b6-1317-4550-8d75-86ff14cd4462) for Microsoft Teams grants users the ability to continually send notifications that repeat every two minutes for up to 20 minutes on all messages marked as urgent. Priority notifications had been made available as a promotion to all Teams customers until the second half of 2020.

Effective immediately, we have ended this promotion and made priority notifications available to all Teams customers as a basic capability. Users will now be able to send and receive unlimited urgent messages with priority notification. [Learn more about managing priority notifications](../messaging-policies-in-teams.md).
