# Office 365 Business Premium

If you have [Office 365 Business Premium](https://products.office.com/en/business/office-365-business-premium), you can use Microsoft Teams to make calls to other people in your business who are on your subscription. For example, if your business has 10 people, you can use Teams to call and IM each other.

**To make and receive calls from people external to your business, you have three options**:

- **Option 1**. Use the [free Teams app](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/free). If you have a very small business (for example, 1-2 people), using the Teams app is the better way to go. It's less expensive to use for domestic and international calls. You can still make 1:1 and group audio and video calls and share your desktop for presentations. [Compare the features, rates, and payment options](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/free).

     We recommend starting with Teams free to see if it meets your needs. However, if it doesn't you still have two options.

- **Option 2. Keep your plan, and buy a Phone System and a Domestic or Domestic and International Calling Plan**.
    1. Buy the Phone System add-on.
    
    2. Buy a [Calling Plan for Office 365](../calling-plans-for-office-365.md) - You can only buy this after you buy the Phone System add-on.
    
- **Option 3. Upgrade your plan, and buy a Phone System and a Domestic or Domestic and International Calling Plan**.

    1. [Switch to a different Office 365 for business plan](https://support.office.com/article/73318661-8f33-478b-bcc7-fb8d69dbb22a). We recommend that you evaluate an Enterprise E5 plan to see if it is more cost effective.

    2. If you decide to buy an Enterprise E5 license, it includes a Phone System license. If you use an Enterprise E1 or E3 license or an Office 365 Business Essentials or Office 365 Business Premium licsense you will need to buy the Phone System add-on.
    
    3. Buy a [Calling Plan for Office 365](../calling-plans-for-office-365.md): you can only buy this after you buy the Phone System add-on.
