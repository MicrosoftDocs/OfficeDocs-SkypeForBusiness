# Office 365 Business Premium

If you have [Office 365 Business Premium](https://products.office.com/en/business/office-365-business-premium), you can use Microsoft Teams to make calls to other people in your business who are on your subscription. For example, if your business has 10 people, you can use Teams to call and IM each other.


**To make and receive calls from people external to your business, you have these options**:

- **Option 1**. Use the [Teams app within your plan](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/free). If you have a very small business (for example, 1-2 people), using the Teams app is the better way to go. It's free and you are able to communicate 1:1 over chat, also group audio and video calls and share your desktop for presentations. [Compare the features, rates, and payment options](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/free).

- **Option 2. Upgrade your plan, and buy a Phone System and a Domestic or Domestic and International Calling Plan**.

    1. [Switch to a different Office 365 for business plan](https://support.office.com/article/73318661-8f33-478b-bcc7-fb8d69dbb22a). We recommend that you evaluate an Enterprise E5 plan to see if it is more cost effective.

    2. If you decide to buy an Enterprise E5 license, it includes a Phone System license. If you use an Enterprise E1 or E3 license you will need to buy the Phone System add-on.
    
    3. Buy a [Calling Plan for Office 365](../calling-plans-for-office-365.md): you can only buy this after you buy the Phone System add-on.


 >[!IMPORTANT]
 > If you already have an O365 Business Premium license, when you download O365 from the portal, it already brings Teams that you can use to talk with collegues and external people, like old skype for business. You can't receive or make calls from phones at least you get two add-ins licenses:
 >- **Phone System**
 >- **A Domestic calling plan** or **Domestic and International Calling Plan**.
