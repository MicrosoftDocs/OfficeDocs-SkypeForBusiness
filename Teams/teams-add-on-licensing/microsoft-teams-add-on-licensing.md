## Overview of all add-on licenses

The following table provides an overview of the add-on licenses that you can add to your Teams subscription. For example, you might want to add an Audio Conferencing license so that users can dial in to meetings using their phones. Or, your organization might decide to deploy Teams Phone, which provides PBX functionality, with an additional option for connecting to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) for external calling.

|License|Description|
|-------|-----------|
| **Microsoft Teams Premium** | Microsoft Teams Premium is an add-on license to Teams that allows organizations with Microsoft 365 subscriptions and Teams licenses to enhance their Teams experience with added benefits, such as personalized and intelligent meetings, enhanced meeting protection, and advanced management and reporting capabilities. <br/> <br/>For more information about the Teams Premium add-on license, see [Microsoft Teams Premium licensing](licensing-enhance-teams.md). |
| **Audio Conferencing** | Audio Conferencing is an add-on license to Teams that enables people in your organization to use a phone instead of their computer to call in to a Teams meeting. <br/><br/>Note that Audio Conferencing doesn't require a Teams Phone license. <br/><br/>[Audio Conferencing licenses](#audio-conferencing-licenses) are described in more detail later in this article. |
| **Teams Phone Standard** | [Teams Phone Standard](../what-is-phone-system-in-office-365.md) is an add-on license to Teams that provides a hosted telephone service. This service provides Private Branch Exchange (PBX) capabilities, such as cloud voicemail, call forwarding, call transfer, auto attendants, call queues, and caller ID. <br/><br/>If your users need to call phone numbers outside your organization, you can choose from several options for connecting to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), including choosing Microsoft as your PSTN carrier. [Teams Phone and PSTN connectivity options](#teams-phone-with-pstn-connectivity-licenses) are described in more detail later in this article. |
| **Microsoft Teams Calling Plans** | Microsoft Teams Calling Plans is an add-on license to Teams Phone for making calls to the PSTN. With this option, Microsoft is your PSTN carrier. If you already have Teams Phone and if Calling Plans are available in your [country/region](../country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md), you can purchase one of the [Calling Plan options](#teams-phone-with-microsoft-calling-plans), which are described in more detail later in this article. |
| **Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle** | Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle is an add-on license to Teams that provides both Teams Phone and a Microsoft Calling Plan for connectivity to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). With this option, Microsoft is your PSTN provider. <br/><br/>[Calling Plan options](#teams-phone-with-microsoft-calling-plans) are described in more detail later in this article.|
| **Communication Credits** | Communication Credits is an add-on license that provides a monthly pool of minutes that can be used for PSTN phone calls. For example, you might want to purchase Communication Credits if all your Calling Plan minutes get used before the beginning of the next month, or if you want toll-free numbers for Audio Conferencing, Auto attendants, or Call queues. For more information, see [set up Communications Credits](../set-up-communications-credits-for-your-organization.md). |
| **Microsoft Teams Rooms** | Microsoft Teams Rooms is an add-on license to Teams that brings video, audio, and content sharing to conference rooms. <br/> <br/>- Teams Rooms Basic is a free license for up to 25 rooms that delivers core meeting and management functionality for all Teams Rooms devices. <br/> <br/>- Teams Rooms Pro brings enhanced meeting experiences and advanced management and security to help you operate your devices at scale and enable inclusive hybrid meetings. <br/> <br/>For more information, see [Teams Meeting Room Licensing](../rooms/rooms-licensing.md). |
| **Microsoft Teams Shared Devices** | Microsoft Teams Shared Devices is an add-on license to Teams that supports hybrid work by allowing offices to designate devices as shared devices, including common area phones, Teams displays for hot-desks, and Teams panels for meeting spaces. For more information, see [Microsoft Teams Shared Devices licensing](teams-shared-device-license.md). |

[!INCLUDE [EEA Teams licensing notice](../includes/eea-teams-licensing.md)]

## Audio Conferencing licenses

An Audio Conferencing license enables people in your organization to use a phone instead of their computer to call in to a Teams meeting--also called PSTN conferencing for meetings. An Audio Conferencing license isn't the same as a Teams Phone license. For information on Teams Phone licenses, see [Teams Phone with PSTN connectivity licenses](#teams-phone-with-pstn-connectivity-licenses).

To find out whether Audio Conferencing is available in your country or region, see [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](../country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md). For pricing info, see [Pricing for Audio Conferencing](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=799762).

For users who schedule or lead meetings with attendees who need to call in using a phone, you'll need to [set up Audio Conferencing](../set-up-audio-conferencing-in-teams.md).

You can also choose to use a third-party operator for your Audio Conferencing numbers if your current operator is part of the Microsoft Operator Connect program. For more information, see [Plan for Operator Connect Conferencing](../operator-connect-conferencing-plan.md).

After purchasing a Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription, if you select either a Microsoft 365 or Office 365 E1 or E3 subscription, you'll still need to buy a separate Audio Conferencing license. An Audio Conferencing license is already included in the E5 subscription.

The following table displays which Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription to purchase based on your subscription audience.

| Subscription type | Subscription |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
|**Enterprise**| - Office 365 E1<sup>1</sup><br/> - Office 365 E3<sup>1</sup><br/> - Office 365 E5<sup>1,3</sup>|
|**Frontline**| - Microsoft 365 F1<br/> - Microsoft 365 F3<br/> - Office 365 F3<sup>2</sup>|
|**Other**| - Office 365 A1<br/> - Microsoft 365 A3<br/> - Microsoft 365 G3|

*<sup>1</sup> Microsoft 365 E3/E5 and Office 365 E1/E3/E5 suites that include Teams are no longer available for purchase by new customers.*

*<sup>2</sup> Office 365 F3 is available for purchase by new customers through Cloud Solution Providers (CSPs) only.*

*<sup>3</sup> This Teams subscription plan gives your organization the most security and compliance features found in the highest tiers of Microsoft 365 and Office 365 subscriptions.*

The following table displays Audio Conferencing license options.

| License | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Standard Audio Conferencing License** | This license includes:<br/> - Toll phone numbers to dial in meetings for all supported countries.<br/> - Toll phone minutes for all supported countries.<br/> - Operator Connect Conferencing.<br/> - 60 outbound minutes per user per month to [Zone A countries](../audio-conferencing-zones.md). These minutes are pooled at the tenant level, so if there's one tenant with multiple Audio Conferencing users, the minutes are shared among all users. |
| **Free Audio Conferencing License** | For outbound calls to the United States and Canada only. With this exception, this license includes:<br/> - The same capabilities as the *Standard Audio Conferencing License*.<br/> - Toll-free phone numbers. <br/> - Toll-free minutes. |

After the 60 minutes of outbound minutes to Zone A countries have been used, your Audio Conferencing users won't be able to make calls or dial out from online Audio Conferencing meetings.

You can purchase additional licenses and assign them to your users so that they can dial out to non-Zone A countries using the following options:

- *Communication Credits* - Prepaid budget to support outgoing minutes. For more information on Communication Credits, see:
  - [What are Communication Credits](../what-are-communications-credits.md).
  - [Set up Communication Credits for your organization](../set-up-communications-credits-for-your-organization.md).
  - [Add funds and manage Communications Credits](../add-funds-and-manage-communications-credits.md).
- *Pay-As-You-Go* - Dial out and pay per user per minute for all outgoing calls.
- *Pay per minute* - Pay for all of your Audio Conferencing usage on a per-minute basis without paying for a per-user monthly license. This option is only available to Volume and Licensing customers. For more information, see [Audio Conferencing pay-per-minute](../audio-conferencing-pay-per-minute.md).

## Teams Phone with PSTN connectivity licenses

Most Microsoft 365 plans allow Teams users to make peer-to-peer calls within your organization using VoIP technology. However, you might want to add licenses for setting up Teams Phone PBX capabilities and connecting to the PSTN for external calling.

Teams Phone requires a separate add-on license. For Teams Phone only, buy a Teams Phone Standard license. For users to make and receive external calls using the PSTN, you'll need to choose a PSTN connectivity option as well.

For PSTN connectivity, there are multiple options, including:

- Choosing Microsoft as your PSTN carrier by purchasing a [Microsoft Calling Plan license](#teams-phone-with-microsoft-calling-plans).

- [Choosing a separate PSTN carrier](#teams-phone-with-a-separate-pstn-connectivity-option).

This section describes Teams Phone license options. Some PSTN connectivity options require an additional license; some don't. For detailed information about Teams Phone PBX features, see [Teams Phone features](../here-s-what-you-get-with-phone-system.md). For information about which voice solution is best for your organization, see [Plan your voice solution](../cloud-voice-landing-page.md) and [PSTN connectivity options](../pstn-connectivity.md).

If you have a frontline worker subscription, buy a Teams Phone Standard for Frontline Workers license. To access the **Teams Phone for Frontline Workers** license, your tenant must also be licensed with Microsoft 365 Frontline Worker or Office 365 Frontline Worker licenses.
