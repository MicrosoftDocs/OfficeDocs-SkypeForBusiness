# Microsoft Teams add-on licenses

## Which capabilities can I get with add-on licenses?

Add-on licenses are licenses for specific Microsoft Teams capabilities. They give you the flexibility to add capabilities only for users in your organization who need them. To add a capability, buy one add-on license for each user who will use it.

The add-on licensing options available to you depend on the Microsoft 365 plan you have. To see which voice calling and audio conferencing options are available to you, see the [Which Microsoft capabilities are available with my plan?](#which-microsoft-capabilities-are-available-with-my-plan) section of this article.

Here's a list of Teams add-on licenses and their capabilities that you can add to your Teams subscription.

|License|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|**Microsoft 365 Business Voice** <br/> |Business Voice was Microsoft's voice capability bundle for small and medium businesses but will no longer be available to purchase starting on March 1, 2022. Current Business Voice subscribers can renew their Business Voice licenses until June 30, 2022. <br/> <br/> If you're a small or medium-sized business, we recommend purchasing the [Teams Phone with Calling Plan license](../business-voice/whats-business-voice.md), if it's available in your region. <br/> <br/> Alternatively, you can purchase a Teams Phone Standard license that will allow you to connect to your preferred third-party PSTN provider. |
|**Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle** <br/> |The Teams Phone with Calling Plan license bundles Teams Phone System's PBX capabilities and a Domestic Calling Plan for PSTN connectivity. <br/> |
|**Teams Phone Standard** <br/> |[Teams Phone System](../what-is-phone-system-in-office-365.md) is a hosted telephone service that gives you call control and Private Branch Exchange (PBX) capabilities. Teams Phone Standard licenses give you all Teams Phone System capabilities like cloud voicemail, caller ID, call park, call forwarding, auto attendants, call queues, call transfer, and caller ID. <br/> <br/>To learn more about Phone System, see [Here's what you get with Teams Phone System](../here-s-what-you-get-with-phone-system.md). <br/> |
|**Microsoft Teams Calling Plans** <br/> |If you want users to be able to call phone numbers outside your organization, you can purchase [Microsoft Teams Calling Plans](../calling-plans-for-office-365.md) to connect to PSTN phone numbers with Microsoft as your PSTN provider. There are Domestic Calling Plans and International Calling Plans. <br/> <br/> To find out whether Teams Calling Plans is available in your country or region, see [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](../country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md). |
|**Communication Credits** | Communication Credits provide a monthly pool of minutes that can also be used for PSTN phone calls, if all your Calling Plan minutes get used before the beginning of the next month. If you want toll-free numbers for Audio Conferencing, auto attendants, or call queues, you'll need to [set up Communications Credits](../set-up-communications-credits-for-your-organization.md). <br/> |
|**Audio Conferencing** <br/> |Sometimes people in your organization will need to use a phone to call in to a Teams meeting instead of their computer. [Set up Audio Conferencing](../set-up-audio-conferencing-in-teams.md) for users who schedule or lead meetings with attendees who need to call in using a phone. <br/> <br/>To find out whether Audio Conferencing is available in your country or region, see [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](../country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md). For pricing info, see [Pricing for Audio Conferencing](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=799762).  <br/> <br/>Organizations can now use a third-party operator for their Audio Conferencing numbers. For more information, see [Plan for Operator Connect Conferencing](../operator-connect-conferencing-plan.md). <br/>|
|**Microsoft Teams Rooms** <br/> | Microsoft Teams Room is an additional Microsoft Teams product that brings video, audio, and content sharing to conference rooms. Organizations can purchase Microsoft Teams Rooms standalone licenses for these capabilities. For more information, see [Teams Meeting Room Licensing](../rooms/rooms-licensing.md). <br/>|

## Which Microsoft capabilities are available with my plan?

All Microsoft 365 plans allow Teams users to make peer-to-peer calls within your organization using VoIP technology. However, you may want to add on different licenses for capabilities like making calls to PSTN numbers or setting up a PBX.

### Voice and PSTN connectivity

Whether you're a small business, enterprise organization, educational institution, government agency, or nonprofit, you have three ways to get Teams Phone System and PSTN connectivity:

- Buy a Microsoft 365 Business, E1/E3, A1/A3, or G1/G3 plan and add **Teams Phone with Calling Plan** bundle licenses.
  - This model will give you Teams Phone System PBX capabilities and a Microsoft Domestic Calling Plan.
  - Choose this setup if you want all phone number management and billing to be handled by Microsoft.
  - Check to see if the [Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle license is available in your region](../country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md).

- Buy an E1/E3, A1/A3, or G1/G3 plan, add **Teams Phone Standard** licenses, and choose a Microsoft standalone calling plan or third-party PSTN carrier.
  - This model will give you Teams Phone System, but you'll still need to connect to the PSTN.
  - To view all your PSTN connectivity options, see [PSTN connectivity options](../pstn-connectivity.md).
  - To learn about all voice solutions, see [Plan your Teams voice solution](../cloud-voice-landing-page.md).

- Buy an E5/A5/G5 plan and add **Microsoft Calling Plans** or connect to a third-party PSTN connectivity provider.
  - The Microsoft 365 E5, A5, and G5 plans include Teams Phone System, but organizations still need to choose a [PSTN connectivity option](../pstn-connectivity.md).

Here's a summary of which Microsoft voice and calling licenses to purchase, based on Microsoft 365 plan:
