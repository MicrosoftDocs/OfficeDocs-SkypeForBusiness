# Microsoft Teams add-on licenses

## What are add-on licenses?

Add-on licenses are licenses for specific Microsoft Teams features. They give you the flexibility to add features only for users in your organization who need them. To add a feature, buy one add-on license for each user who will use it.

## What features can I get with add-on licenses?

Here's a list of features that you can add with Teams add-on licenses. The add-on licensing options available to you depend on the Microsoft 365 or Office 365 plan you have.

For pricing info, see [Pricing for Audio Conferencing](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=799762).  <br/> |&#x2713;<sup>1</sup>|&#x2713;|
|**Toll free numbers** |If you want toll-free numbers for Audio Conferencing, auto attendants, or call queues, you must [set up Communications Credits](../set-up-communications-credits-for-your-organization.md). <br/> |&#x2713;|&#x2713;|

<sup>1</sup> If you're a small or medium-sized business who has a Microsoft 365 Enterprise plan, you can still buy add-on licenses for these cloud voice features, however, we recommend that you consider a [Microsoft 365 business](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compare-all-microsoft-365-products?&activetab=tab:primaryr2) plan and [Business Voice](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/business-voice).

## What voice features are available with my plan?

See what add-on licenses you need to get voice features in Teams, depending on the plan you have.

Depending on the voice features that you want, we recommend comparing whether it's more cost effective for you to switch to a plan that includes those features. For example, for most large organizations, buying a bundle of software in a Microsoft 365 Enterprise plan will result in lower overall cost. Typically, when you buy several add-on licenses individually instead of as part of a plan, you may end up with a higher combined cost.

#### [**Small business**](#tab/small-business/)

If you're a small or medium-sized business (less than 300 users), you have four ways to get voice features:

- Buy a Microsoft 365 Business plan and Microsoft 365 Business Voice
- Buy an Enterprise E1 or E3 plan and Microsoft 365 Business Voice
- Buy an Enterprise E1 or E3 plan and add voice features individually
- Buy an Enterprise E5 plan, which includes voice features

For Microsoft 365 Business Voice, you have two options to choose from:

- **Microsoft 365 Business Voice with a Calling Plan**: Get this if you want all phone number management and billing to be handled by Microsoft.
- **Microsoft 365 Business Voice without a Calling Plan (Direct Routing)**: Get this if you want all phone number management and billing to be handled by your third-party telephone provider. You'll need to set up and deploy [Direct Routing](../direct-routing-landing-page.md) to connect your on-premises Session Border Controllers (SBCs) to Microsoft 365 or Office 365.

Here's a summary of the add-on options available to small and medium-sized business (less than 300 users) based on licensing plan.

  ![Small business plan options](../media/licensing-small-business-options.png)

If you already have a Microsoft 365 Enterprise or Office 365 Enterprise (or EDU, GOV or Nonprofit) plan, you can still buy add-on licenses for individual voice features. However, you have the option to switch to a [Microsoft 365 Business](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compare-all-microsoft-365-products?&activetab=tab:primaryr2) plan and [Microsoft 365 Business Voice](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/business-voice). In some cases, depending on the features that you want, it might be more cost effective to get a Microsoft 365 Business plan with Microsoft 365 Business Voice.

> [!NOTE]
> These voice features can also be deployed with [Direct Routing](../direct-routing-landing-page.md).

#### [**Enterprise**](#tab/enterprise/)

If you're a large business or enterprise organization (more than 300 users), you have two ways to get voice features:

- [Office 365 E1 Trial](../e1-trial-license.md), which includes Teams, is a free 6-month E1 license for any customer that's managed by a Microsoft account rep. It's for organizations, including nonprofits, who haven't activated any other Office 365 E1 trials in the past.
