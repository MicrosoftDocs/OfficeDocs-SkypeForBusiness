# Microsoft Teams add-on licenses

## What features can I get with add-on licenses?

Add-on licenses are licenses for specific Microsoft Teams features. They give you the flexibility to add features only for users in your organization who need them. To add a feature, buy one add-on license for each user who will use it.

The add-on licensing options available to you depend on the Microsoft 365 or Office 365 plan you have. To see which voice options are available to you, see the [What voice features are available with my plan?](#what-voice-features-are-available-with-my-plan) section of this article.

Here's a list of Teams add-on licenses and their features that you can add to your Teams subscription.

<br/>

|License|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|**Microsoft 365 Business Voice** <br/> | Business Voice was Microsoft's voice feature bundle for small and medium businesses but will be deprecated on March 1, 2022. <br/> <br/> If you're a small or medium-sized business, we recommend purchasing the [Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle](../business-voice/whats-business-voice.md), if it's available in your region. |
|**Teams Phone with Calling Plans bundle** <br/> |Teams Phone with Calling Plans is a telephony solution that bundles Phone System's PBX capabilities and a Domestic Calling Plan for PSTN connectivity. <br/> |
|**Teams Phone** <br/> |[Teams Phone](../what-is-phone-system-in-office-365.md) is a hosted telephone service that gives you call control and Private Branch Exchange (PBX) capabilities, with options for connecting to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). Teams Phone features include cloud voicemail, caller ID, call park, call forwarding, auto attendants, call queues, call transfer, caller ID, and more. <br>To learn more, see [Here's what you get with Teams Phone](../here-s-what-you-get-with-phone-system.md). For pricing info, see [Pricing for Teams Phone](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=799763).  <br/> |
|**Calling Plans** <br/> |If you want users to be able to call phone numbers outside your organization, get a [Calling Plan](../calling-plans-for-office-365.md). There are Domestic Calling Plans and Domestic and International Calling Plans. For pricing info, see [Pricing for Calling Plans](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=799761 ).  <br/> |
|**Communication Credits** |If you want toll-free numbers for Audio Conferencing, auto attendants, or call queues, you must [set up Communications Credits](../set-up-communications-credits-for-your-organization.md). <br/> |
|**Audio Conferencing** <br/> |Sometimes people in your organization will need to use a phone to call in to a Teams meeting instead their computer. Set up [Audio Conferencing](../audio-conferencing-in-office-365.md) for users who schedule or lead meetings. <br/> <br/>To find out whether Audio Conferencing is available in your country or region, see [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](../country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md). For pricing info, see [Pricing for Audio Conferencing](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=799762).  <br/> <br/>From now until May 31, 2022, customers can add Audio Conferencing to a Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription for free for up to 12 months. Starting on March 1, 2022, Audio Conferencing functionality will be included in all Teams-inclusive Microsoft 365 and Office 365 licenses. To learn more, see [Set up Audio Conferencing for small and medium businesses](../audio-conferencing-smb.md). <br/> <br/>Organizations can now use a third-party operator for their Audio Conferencing numbers. See [Plan for Operator Connect Conferencing](../operator-connect-conferencing-plan.md) for more information. <br/>|
|**Microsoft Teams Rooms** <br/> |[Microsoft Teams Rooms](../rooms/index.md) isn't an add-on, but a feature that brings video, audio, and content sharing to conference rooms. See [Teams Meeting Room Licensing](../rooms/rooms-licensing.md).  <br/> |
|**Advanced Communications** <br/> |[Advanced Communications](advanced-communications.md) includes advanced meetings customization and tools to manage your organization's communication policies. |

## What voice features are available with my plan?

See what add-on licenses you need to get voice features in Teams, depending on the plan you have.

Depending on the voice features that you want, we recommend comparing whether it's more cost effective for you to switch to a plan that includes those features. For example, for most large organizations, buying a bundle of software in a Microsoft 365 Enterprise plan will result in lower overall cost. Typically, when you buy several add-on licenses individually instead of as part of a plan, you may end up with a higher combined cost.

#### [**Small and medium businesses**](#tab/small-business/)

If you're a small or medium-sized business (less than 300 users), you have four ways to get voice features:

- Buy a Microsoft 365 Business plan and Microsoft 365 Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle.
- Buy an Enterprise E1 or E3 plan and Microsoft 365 Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle.
- Buy an Enterprise E1 or E3 plan and add voice features individually.
- Buy an Enterprise E5 plan, which includes voice features.
  - The Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5 plan includes Teams Phone, but organizations will still need to choose a [PSTN connectivity option](../pstn-connectivity.md).

For Microsoft 365 Teams Phone, you have two options to choose from:

- **Microsoft 365 Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle**: Get this if you want all phone number management and billing to be handled by Microsoft. Check to see if [Teams Phone with Calling Plan is available in your region](../country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md).
- **Microsoft 365 Teams Phone standalone license**: This license includes Teams Phone, but you'll still need to connect to the PSTN. To learn about voice solutions, see [Plan your Teams voice solution](../cloud-voice-landing-page.md). To view all your PSTN connectivity options, see [PSTN connectivity options](../pstn-connectivity.md).

To learn more, see [Teams Phone guidance for small and medium businesses](../business-voice/whats-business-voice.md).
