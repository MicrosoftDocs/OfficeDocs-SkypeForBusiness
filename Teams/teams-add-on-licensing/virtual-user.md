# Microsoft Teams Phone Standard – Virtual User licenses

Organizations with Teams Phone Standard or Teams Phone with Calling Plan licensed users can assign either a free *Microsoft Teams Phone Standard – Virtual User* license or a paid *Teams Phone Standard* user license to resource accounts. A Microsoft calling plan isn't always required (see [Plan for Teams Auto attendant and call queues](../plan-auto-attendant-call-queue.md#prerequisites) for prerequisites when transferring calls to an external phone number).

All auto attendants and call queues require an associated resource account. Resource accounts that require a phone number need either a free *Microsoft Teams Phone Standard – Virtual User* license or a paid *Teams Phone Standard* user license before a phone number can be applied to the resource account.

> [!TIP]
> No license is needed for resource accounts that will be used with nested auto attendants or call queues that don't have a phone number assigned. See the following diagram for reference.

## Virtual User license allocation

Your organization is allotted *Microsoft Teams Phone Standard – Virtual User* licenses depending on its overall size. Any organization that has at least one license with Teams Phone System, including Teams Phone Standard and Teams Phone with Calling Plan licenses, has 25 Virtual User licenses available at no cost. When you add 10 Teams Phone Standard or Teams Phone with Calling Plan user licenses in your organization, one more *Microsoft Teams Phone Standard – Virtual User* license becomes available.

> [!NOTE]
> Teams Phone Standard and Teams Phone with Calling Plan are add-on licenses available to all Microsoft 365 subscribers. Teams Phone Standard licenses are also included as part of Microsoft 365 E5 plans.

If your organization uses up the free *Microsoft Teams Phone Standard – Virtual User* licenses in creating auto attendant or call queue nodes, you can still use the paid *Teams Phone Standard* licenses with a resource account. Most organizations will have enough Virtual User licenses based on the scaling plan.

### License allocation example

Contoso, Inc. purchased 600 licenses that include Phone System (one for each employee). Contoso is allotted an initial 25 plus 60 *Microsoft Teams Phone Standard – Virtual User* licenses, 85 in total. Their organization has 90 call queues and auto attendants that have phone numbers. They need to assign all the *Microsoft Teams Phone Standard – Virtual User* licenses and obtain five regular-priced *Teams Phone Standard* licenses.

Contoso should consider redesigning the auto attendant and call queue system. If they use fewer phone numbers and more nested nodes that don't need a phone number, they simplify the implementation and reduce costs.

## How to buy Microsoft Teams Phone Standard – Virtual User licenses

1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center.
2. Go to **Billing** > **Purchase services** > **Add-ons**.
3. Scroll to the end to find the **Microsoft Teams Phone Standard – Virtual User** license. Select **Buy now**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Keep in mind you must still **Buy** the license even though it has a cost of zero.

## Change an existing resource account to use a Microsoft Teams Phone Standard – Virtual User license

If you decide to switch the license on your resource account from a *Teams Phone Standard* license to a *Microsoft Teams Phone Standard – Virtual User* license:

1. Get the new Microsoft Teams Phone Standard – Virtual User license.
2. Follow the linked steps in the Microsoft 365 Admin center to [Move users to a different subscription](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users#move-users-to-a-different-subscription).

> [!WARNING]
> Always remove a full *Teams Phone Standard* license and assign the *Microsoft Teams Phone Standard – Virtual User* license in the same license activity. If you remove the old license, save the account changes, add the new license, and then save the account settings again, the resource account may no longer function as expected. If this happens, we recommend you create a new resource account for the *Microsoft Teams Phone Standard – Virtual User* license and remove the broken resource account.
