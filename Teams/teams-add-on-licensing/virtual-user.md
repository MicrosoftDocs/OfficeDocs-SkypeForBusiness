# Virtual user license

They can either buy a Phone System license or use a Phone System - virtual user license for resource accounts. However, for the time being, they must also have a Calling Plan. They need three licenses to be assigned to a resource account: Phone System (either), Calling Plan, Communication Credits.



## Free Virtual Licenses

The number of free licenses your organization has to assign to call queues or auto attendants depends on the overall size. The table below summarizes how free licenses scale.

|Column1  |Column2  |
|:---------|:---------|
|Row1     |         |
|Row2     |         |
|Row3     |         |
|Row4     |         |
|Row5     |         |
|Row6     |         |

If your organization uses up its free licenses in creating auto attendant or call queue nodes, you'll have to use the paid licenses.  

You can also add Phone System and a Calling Plan to a Small Business Essentials license.

## Virtual User License customers: How to see prices and buy

1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center.
2. Go to **Billing** > **Purchase services** > **Add-on subscriptions**
3. Scroll to the end - you will see "Phone System - Virtual User" license. Select **Buy now**.

If you don't see the license, it may not be available to your tenant yet.
