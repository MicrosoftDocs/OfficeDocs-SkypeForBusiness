# Overview of meetings, webinars, and town halls

**APPLIES TO:** ✔️Meetings ✔️Webinars ✔️Town halls

There are multiple ways to meet in Microsoft Teams:

- Meetings
- Webinars
- Town halls

This article, intended for administrators and IT professionals, describes the differences between meetings, webinars, and town halls. You can use this information as a first step in planning for these types of virtual meetings and events.

The sections below include further information for planning and configuring these features, as well as links to information for your end users.

The following table shows the main features that are different between meetings, webinars, and town halls. You can use this information to help determine which is best for the use cases in your organization. For a detailed look at the features available in each, see [Meetings, webinars, and town halls feature comparison](meeting-webinar-town-hall-feature-comparison.md).

|Feature|Meetings|Webinars|Town halls|

<sup>1</sup>The usual maximum is increased to 20,000 through June 30, 2024. The maximum total participants for meetings is the sum of the interactive participants plus view-only participants.<br>

<sup>2</sup> Breakout rooms can be used if a webinar has fewer than 300 participants. However, if the number of participants increases to above 300, breakout rooms aren't supported.

For more information on limits and specifications for Teams webinars, meetings, and town halls, see [Limits and specifications for Microsoft Teams.](limits-specifications-teams.md)

## Manage who can create meetings, webinars, and town halls

You can manage which of your users can create meetings, webinars, and town halls by using meeting and event policies. For example, you might want to allow all your users to create meetings, but only people in marketing to create webinars, and only executives to create town halls. Anyone invited can attend these types of meetings, but only those you specify can create them.

For details, see:

- [Manage who can start instant meetings and schedule meetings](manage-who-can-schedule-meetings.md)
- [Manage who can schedule webinars](set-up-webinars.md)
- [Manage who can schedule town halls](set-up-town-halls.md)

## Meetings

Meetings are generally best for situations where participants need to interact with each other via voice, video, or chat and where multiple people may be presenting. Meetings in Teams include audio, video, and screen sharing for up to 1,000 people and a view-only experience for participants over 900. Participants don't need to be a member of an organization (or have a Teams account) to join a Teams meeting. They can join directly from the calendar invitation via the Join meeting link or call in via audio if available.

In addition to regularly scheduled meetings, your users can create channel meetings. With channel meetings, everybody in a team can see there's a meeting, join the meeting, and use the meeting chat.

Teams Premium offers additional meetings functionality through the Teams Premium subscription. For a list of Teams Premium features for meetings, see [Microsoft Teams Premium - Overview for admins](enhanced-teams-experience.md).

For detailed information on how to plan for Teams meetings in your organization, see [Plan for Teams meetings](plan-meetings.md).

## Webinars

Webinars are structured events where presenters and participants have clear roles. A key difference between webinars and Teams meetings is that webinars support robust registration management, a customizable event and registration site, and event-oriented default meeting options.

Teams Premium offers additional meetings functionality through the Teams Premium subscription. For a list of Teams Premium features for webinars, see [Microsoft Teams Premium - Overview for admins](enhanced-teams-experience.md#webinars) and [Microsoft Teams Premium licensing.](/MicrosoftTeams/teams-add-on-licensing/licensing-enhance-teams#webinars).

| [Visual quick start guide](https://adoption.microsoft.com/files/assets/TeamsWebinarsGetStartedGuide.pdf) | A downloadable visual guide that describes how to start scheduling webinars. |

## Town halls

Town halls are generally best for situations where a limited number of presenters are presenting to a large group of attendees and direct interaction via chat or voice conversation isn't needed. For these event formats, attendees don't use their cameras and mics, but instead use Q&A to engage with presenters and organizers.

For a list of Teams Premium features for town halls, see [Microsoft Teams Premium - Overview for admins](enhanced-teams-experience.md#webinars) and [Microsoft Teams Premium licensing.](/MicrosoftTeams/teams-add-on-licensing/licensing-enhance-teams#webinars).

To understand key differences between live events and town halls, see [Plan for town halls](plan-town-halls.md#live-events-and-premium-town-halls).

For detailed information on how to plan for Teams town halls, see [Plan for Teams town halls](plan-town-halls.md).

## Best practices for large meetings and events

This section provides guidance for admins, along with tips that admins can share with their presenters and organizers.

To run a successful event, follow the practices outlined below:

- For the best experience in large meetings, webinars, and town halls, Microsoft recommends using the latest version of the Teams desktop client or Teams mobile clients.

- Ensure that all Microsoft [Network Connectivity Principles](/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-network-connectivity-principles) have been followed both on-premises and for remote users. The network connectivity principles apply to meetings, webinars, and town halls.
- Use [real-time data telemetry](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/introducing-microsoft-teams-real-time-call-quality-analytics/ba-p/2912146) to monitor the event and identify any possible issues and its source.
  - Designate meeting monitors to [analyze](use-real-time-telemetry-to-troubleshoot-poor-meeting-quality.md) telemetry for users facing poor experience caused by metrics exceeding thresholds.
  - Set meeting monitors as presenters to disable rogue video streams, mute accidental live mics, and remove attendees if needed.
