# End of availability for classic Teams client

## Overview

On March 31 2024, a new Teams client will be rolled out for users who are still on classic Teams, installing the new Teams client for them and uninstalling the classic Teams client. After this time, classic Teams will be unavailable for different users as outlined in this table:

## User experience

### What users will see until March 31 2024

Starting on February 1 2024, any classic Teams users who haven’t updated to new Teams will begin seeing an informational banner to remind them about the timeline for the auto update. This banner will appear in the main Teams client window at the top of the page (underneath the main bar).

:::image type="content" source="media/teams-client-eol-switch-banner.png" alt-text="Shows the banner in Teams client that reads 'Classic Teams won't be available after March 31, 2024. You'll be switched to the new Teams after this date. Switch now.' Switch now is a selectable link.":::

> [!NOTE]
> You can dismiss this banner in every client session until the end of February 2024, but it will reappear with each client launch.

Classic Teams will remain available to use until March 31 2024. However, we highly encourage admins to update their users to new Teams, as new features are only being added to the new Teams client. Learn more in the [Upgrade to the new Teams using policies](new-teams-deploy-using-policies.md) article.

If users are on an unsupported OS (including Win 10 LTSC), you’ll see a slightly different banner messaging:

:::image type="content" source="media/teams-client-eol-requirements-banner.png" alt-text="Shows the banner in Teams client that reads 'Classic Teams won't be available for use after June 30, 2024. To use the new Teams, update your OS to meet requirements or contact your IT Admin.' Requirements is a selectable link.":::

> [!NOTE]
> Users on a June 30th timeline will see this banner from April 1 2024.

Here's a list of the banner messages you may experience after January 31 2024:

|Condition for triggering the banner |Banner message |Further information |

|Microsoft cannot update because of policy restrictions (Commercial) |Classic Teams won’t be available for use after March 31, 2024, and we can't update to the new Teams due to org policy. For more info, contact your IT admin. Learn more |[Troubleshooting installation issues in the new Teams client](new-teams-troubleshooting-installation.md) |
|If your Teams update policy is set to **Not enabled** |Classic Teams won’t be available for use after March 31, 2024. Contact your IT admin to switch to the new Teams. Learn more |[Classic Teams users to be updated to new Teams after March 31, 2024](new-teams-deploy-using-policies.md) |

### What users will experience after March 31 2024

After March 31 2024, if you’re already running on new Teams, there will be no change in behavior. Your Teams will continue working as expected.

Users on classic Teams will be automatically updated to the new Teams client. Users won’t be able to switch back to classic Teams after this date, because classic Teams won’t be functional. Microsoft will attempt to uninstall classic Teams.

If you're on the June timeline, here's a list of the banner messages you may experience after March 31 2024:

|Condition for triggering the banner |Banner message |Further information |

### What happens if we can’t update users to new Teams

Once classic Teams is no longer available for you, you're going to see a dialog similar to the one below, and classic Teams won't work for you anymore.

:::image type="content" source="media/teams-client-eol-notification-box.png" alt-text="Teams dialog box that appears after classic Teams no longer works, if you're unable to be updated to the new Teams client. The notification box has a link to requirements and a button that takes you to Teams on the web.":::

To use Teams after this point, install the new Teams client or use Teams on the web.

If you fall under the June 30 2024 list items and you aren’t able to be updated at the end of March, your classic Teams client will continue to run until June 30 2024. There will continue to be a warning banner at the top of your client. We do ask that users update their OS and address any other issues to continue using the Teams client after this time, as new features are only being added to the new Teams client.

## Admin experience

### What admins will see until March 31 2024

Admins have full control over their tenant’s transition to new Teams via the [Upgrade to the new Teams using policies](new-teams-deploy-using-policies.md) article.

A bulk installer, including offline capability, is provided for admins who want to deploy new Teams using their own tools and process and use Teams policies to move their users to the desired experience: [Bulk upgrade to the new Microsoft Teams client](new-teams-bulk-install-client.md).

Microsoft highly recommends that admins who want more control or a more gradual rollout of new Teams take advantage of these tools and functionality to begin slowly transitioning their users to new Teams now. Policies can be targeted to individual users, groups of users, or your entire tenant to give you flexibility to release to users group by group while monitoring progress and feedback.

### What admins will experience starting March 31 2024

Beginning March 31 2024, all policy options within Teams Admin Center to control the transition to new Teams will be made unavailable or will no longer function for all users.

After these options are removed, Microsoft will begin moving all users except VDI users back to the **Microsoft controlled** policy setting. After March 31 2024, the **Microsoft controlled** policy setting will equate to the user being assigned the **New Teams Only** policy (this policy option will be released soon). This will allow them to transition the user to new Teams and then uninstall the classic Teams client. Learn more in the [Upgrade to the new Teams using policies](new-teams-deploy-using-policies.md) article.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **If a user can’t install the new Teams client due to a reason outlined in the table above, such as unsupported OS (including Win 10 LTSC):** These users will be allowed to use classic Teams until June 30, 2024 (as per above schedule) to allow for updating operating system to modifying permissions etc. After June 30 2024, classic Teams won't work.
