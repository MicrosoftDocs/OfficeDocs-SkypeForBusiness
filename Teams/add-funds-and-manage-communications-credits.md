# Add funds and manage Communications Credits

Communications Credits are a convenient way to pay for Phone System and Calling Plans in Microsoft 365 or Office 365. Communication Credits helps ensure that you and your users are never caught without being able to:
  
- Dial in to Audio Conferencing meetings using toll-free dial-in phone numbers.

- Dial out from an Audio Conferencing meeting to add someone else from anywhere in the world.

- Dial out from an Audio Conferencing meeting to your mobile phone with the Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams app installed.

- Dial any international phone number when you have a **Domestic Calling Plan**.

- Dial out and pay per minute once you have exhausted your monthly minute allotment.

- Dial out and pay per minute for all outgoing calls, if you have a Pay-As-You-Go Calling Plan.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're wondering how much it is and the rates, see the rates table on the [Calling Plans](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=799523) page.
  
As admin, you can add funds manually or you can set up auto-recharge, which we **recommend**.
  
Auto-recharge automatically tops off your balance when it falls below the trigger amount you set. We recommend using auto-recharge so you don't have to remember to add funds manually. When your balance hits the trigger amount, funds are added automatically. If you don't choose auto-recharge, you run the risk of your balance falling below zero. At that point, you and your users won't be able to make toll-free calls or international calls.
  
You can update your payment options at any time. On the **Subscriptions** page, select **Communications Credits**, and make your updates.
  
Funds will be applied only to Communications Credits at Microsoft's published rates when the services are used. Any funds not used within 12 months of the purchase date will expire and be forfeited.
  
> [!TIP]
> We'll send you email notifications when funds are added via auto-recharge, when auto-recharge fails (for example, when a credit card expires), and when your balance reaches zero.
