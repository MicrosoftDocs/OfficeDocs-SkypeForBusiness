# Enterprise content delivery networks for streaming Microsoft Teams events

**APPLIES TO:** ✔️Meetings ✖️Webinars ✔️Town halls ✔️Live events

Teams streaming events can use enterprise content delivery networks (eCDNs), including the Microsoft eCDN and eCDNs from Microsoft partners. Teams streaming events include:

- Town halls
- Live events
- Meetings with more than 1,000 participants

Playback of videos from Microsoft Teams events uses adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR) delivered as a unicast stream. Every viewer gets their own video stream from the internet. For events or videos sent out to large portions of your organization, there could be a significant amount of network and internet bandwidth consumed by viewers.

Organizations might want to understand and reduce the network traffic for events and popular videos. If so, you can enable Teams to integrate with Microsoft’s enterprise content delivery network (eCDN) or trusted Microsoft partners that offer eCDN solutions. The eCDN solutions from our trusted partners include capabilities like real-time monitoring, and in-depth network analytics. These eCDN platforms let organizations monitor, scale, and optimize the distribution of video streams (and sometimes other content types) across your enterprise network.

## Microsoft eCDN

**Microsoft eCDN** solves the network congestion problem that occurs during large corporate virtual events such as all-hands meetings. Microsoft eCDN forms a mesh network over the LAN, which reduces the load by up to 98%. With WebRTC as its foundation, Microsoft eCDN eliminates the need for any software or hardware installations. Microsoft eCDN is included with a Teams Premium license, but you can also purchase this solution for organizers who don't have a Teams Premium license.

- Microsoft eCDN works out of the box without any configuration. The network configuration for Microsoft eCDN ensures that remote workers and/or heavy video traffic doesn't strain your network nor oblige you to invest in costly infrastructure. It includes automatic site detection, automatic VPN detection, and automatic NAT/firewall traversal. To learn more, see [How to enable Microsoft eCDN](/ecdn/how-to/enable-microsoft-ecdn-for-your-tenant).
- Silent Testing with Microsoft eCDN allows admins to simulate large events on their corporate network, allowing thorough and non-disruptive testing and troubleshooting before a real event. To learn more, see [Perform a silent test](/ecdn/how-to/perform-silent-test).
- Industry-leading analytics from Microsoft eCDN provide granular analyses and allow admins to quickly find the root cause for any streaming issue. Your toolkit includes delivery and UX metrics, advanced drill downs,  and per-user analytics. Learn more at [Analytics](/ecdn/technical-documentation/analytics).
Town hall organizers with a Teams Premium license have Microsoft eCDN on by default, but you can select a different eCDN solution for these organizers. Without Microsoft eCDN, town hall organizers with a Premium license might not be able to access some future features that require this eCDN solution.
To change the eCDN solution your Premium town hall organizers use, see the [Manage the eCDN solution for Premium town halls](#manage-the-ecdn-solution-for-premium-town-halls) section in this article.

## Acquire and set up your eCDN solution outside of Teams

Get expert help with monitoring and scaling video delivery by teaming up with trusted Microsoft eCDN partners.
Before you can enable an eCDN solution to be used with Teams, you must purchase and set up that eCDN solution outside and separate from Teams. To ensure that the solution meets your needs, some partners provide free trials of their content delivery and network analytics technologies.
Several eCDN solutions are pre-integrated and can be enabled for use with Teams. See information about the providers in the next section.

> [!NOTE]
> Your chosen eCDN solution is subject to the selected partner eCDN provider’s terms of service and privacy policy, which will govern your use of the eCDN provider’s solution. Your use of the eCDN provider’s solution will not be subject to the Microsoft volume licensing terms or Online Services Terms. If you don't agree to the 3rd party provider’s terms, then don't enable the eCDN solution in Microsoft Teams.

## Configure your eCDN solution

Follow these steps to configure your eCDN solution:

1. Open the Teams admin center as a Microsoft 365 Global admin or a Teams admin and navigate to the [events settings](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/broadcasts/settings) page.
1. Toggle the **Video distribution provider** to **On**.
1. Choose an **eCDN/SDN provider** from the **Video distribution provider** dropdown list.
1. Fill out the other fields as directed by your solution provider (some solution providers don't use all the fields).
1. Select **Save**.
1. To check if your setup is correct, select **Verify setup**.
    - Search for any video in your organization to validate with.
    - If your eCDN provider is set up correctly, you see a **Success** message on the verify setup tool.
    - If you aren't set up correctly, you see a **Failure** message. Copy the event message to share with your provider for troubleshooting.

## Manage the eCDN solution for Premium town halls

Microsoft eCDN solution is the default for town hall organizers with a Teams Premium license. You can manage whether your Premium organizers use the Microsoft eCDN or one of our partner eCDN solutions.

|Teams admin center policy option|Parameter value in PowerShell| Behavior|
|---------|---------|---------------|
|On|$true| **This is the default value.** Premium town hall organizers with this policy use the Microsoft eCDN.|
|Off|$false| Premium town hall organizers with this policy use your chosen partner eCDN solution. These organizers might not be able use some future town hall features.|

### Using the Teams admin center

Follow these steps to use the Teams admin center to manage which eCDN solution your organizers with a Premium license use for town halls.

1. Open the Teams admin center.
2. Expand **Meetings** from the navigation pane.
3. Under **Meetings**, select **Events Policies**.
4. Either select an existing policy or create a new one.
5. Toggle the **Use Microsoft eCDN** setting to **Off**.
6. Select Save.

### Using PowerShell

You can use PowerShell to manage which eCDN solution your organizers with a Premium license use for town halls.
To manage eCDN for Premium town halls, use the **`-UseMicrosoftECDN`** parameter within the PowerShell [**CsTeamsEventsPolicy**](/powershell/module/teams/set-csteamseventspolicy).
To allow Premium town hall organizers to use a partner eCDN solution, use the following script:

```powershell
Set-CsTeamsEventsPolicy -Identity <policy name> -UseMicrosoftECDN $false
```

## Configure Teams production type events through Teams and Yammer for your eCDN solution

If you plan to create Teams events through Teams or Yammer, you need to [configure your eCDN provider to be integrated with Microsoft Teams](teams-live-events/what-are-teams-live-events.md#enterprise-content-delivery-network-ecdn) as well.

### Get to video analytics reports for your eCDN solution

As noted earlier in this article, some eCDN solutions also provide analytics reports that give deeper information about playback sessions, viewers, and quality of service.
If your provider gave you an analytics report URL template during the setup in the Teams admin center, then video or event owners can effortlessly access the analytics report for any specific video or event.
Owners of videos can see an Analytics tab directly under the video. On this tab, there's a link for owners to access the analytics report for this specific video in the eCDN provider's system.
If you're a Teams admin, you can access the Analytics tab and view the eCDN analytics report link, even without ownership of the live event or video.

1. As a Teams admin, go to the video player page.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. Select **View in admin mode**.
1. Select the **Analytics** tab.

## Troubleshooting issues

Make sure that your eCDN solution is set up correctly in your network and that you properly configure Teams to enable the provider per their instructions and specific configuration strings. If you're still having issues, some of the information in the next section might help.

### Verify setup tool

If you're having issues with your eCDN solution, you can always come back and run the **Verify setup** tool. The eCDN provider event messages shown for your test video can give you and your eCDN provider more information on what's not working.

- Go to **Settings** > **Admin Settings** > **eCDN provider** > **Verify setup**

### Disable eCDN for a specific session via URL query string

To determine if an issue you're seeing is with the eCDN solution or with Teams, you can easily disable the eCDN solution for a specific playback session via query string.

- If your playback URL already has a question mark, **?**, in it, then add **&disableSDN=true**.
- If your playback URL doesn't have a question mark, **?**, in it then add **?disableSDN=true**.

### View eCDN info in browser console

If your eCDN solution provider supports it, they might print debug information during initialization of playback through their solution. This extra info could be helpful in determining what is going wrong. You can enable extra console debug messages via the query string.

- If your playback URL already has a question mark, **?**, in it, then add **&isSDNDebug=true**.
- If your playback URL doesn't have a question mark, **?**, in it then add **?isSDNDebug=true**.

Select **F12** on your keyboard when your browser is active and switch to the **Console** tab to see all the information printed during the loading of the page with the isSDNDebug=true query string set on the playback URL.

## Configure a third-party video distribution provider

If you purchased and set up a software defined network (SDN) solution or enterprise content delivery network (eCDN) solution through a Microsoft video delivery partner, configure the provider for events in Teams.

### Using the Microsoft Teams admin center

1. In the left navigation, go to **Meetings** > **Live event settings**.
2. Under **Third-party video distribution providers**, complete the following:
    ![Third-party video distribution provider settings in the admin center.](media/teams-live-events-settings-distribution-provider-new.png "Screen shot of the third-party video distribution provider settings for live events")
    - **Third-party distribution provider** Turn this ON to enable the third-party video distribution provider.
    - **SDN provider name** Choose the provider you're using.
    - **SDN Configuration** Enter SDN Configuration details.

### Using Windows PowerShell

Get the license ID or API token and API template from your provider contact. Next, run one of the following, depending on the provider you're using:

#### Microsoft eCDN

```PowerShell
Set-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastConfiguration -AllowSdnProviderForBroadcastMeeting $True -SdnProviderName microsoft
```

#### Hive

```PowerShell
Set-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastConfiguration -AllowSdnProviderForBroadcastMeeting $True -SdnProviderName hive -SdnLicenseId {license ID GUID provided by Hive} -SdnApiTemplateUrl “{API template URL provided by Hive}”
```

#### Kollective

```PowerShell
Set-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastConfiguration -AllowSdnProviderForBroadcastMeeting $True -SdnProviderName kollective -SdnApiTemplateUrl "{API template URL provided by Kollective}" -SdnApiToken {API token GUID provided by Kollective}
```

#### Ramp

```PowerShell
Set-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastConfiguration -AllowSdnProviderForBroadcastMeeting $True -SdnProviderName ramp -SdnRuntimeConfiguration "{Configuration provided by RAMP}"
```

For more information, see [Set-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastConfiguration](/powershell/module/teams/set-csteamsmeetingbroadcastconfiguration).
