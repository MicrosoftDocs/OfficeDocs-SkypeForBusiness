# Set up Phone System voicemail

This article is for the [Office 365 admin](https://support.office.com/article/da585eea-f576-4f55-a1e0-87090b6aaa9d) who wants to set up the Phone System voicemail feature for everyone in the business.

> [!NOTE]
> Phone System voicemail supports depositing voicemail messages only in an Exchange mailbox and doesn't support any third-party email systems. As a fallback mechanism, Phone System voicemail can resend messages using SMTP, which means users with a mailbox on a third-party email system will receive their voicemail messages with no guaranteed service uptime or other voicemail features, such as changing their greetings and other settings.

## Cloud-only environments: Set up Phone System voicemail

For Skype for Business Online and Calling Plans users, Phone System voicemail is automatically set up and provisioned for users after you assign a **Phone System** license and a phone number to them.
  
1. If the Phone System feature isn't included in your plan, you may need to purchase **Phone System** add-on licenses. You may also need to purchase an Exchange Online license. See [Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](/SkypeForBusiness/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing).

After you do that, they will be able to receive voicemail messages!

### Turning off transcription for your organization

Because the default setting for transcription is on for your organization, you may want to disable it by using [Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt798310.aspx). To do this, run:

```
Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy -EnableTranscription $false
```

### Turning on transcription profanity masking for your organization

Transcription profanity masking is disabled by default for your organization. If there is a business requirement to enable it, you can enable transcription profanity masking by using [Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt798310.aspx). To do this, run:

```
Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy -EnableTranscriptionProfanityMasking $true
```

### Turning off transcription for a user

User policies are evaluated before the organizational default settings. For example, if voicemail transcription is enabled for all of your users, you can assign a policy to disable transcription for a specific user by using the [Grant-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt798309.aspx) cmdlet.

To disable transcription for a single user, run:

```
Grant-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy -PolicyName TranscriptionDisabled -Identity sip:amosmar@contoso.com
```

### Turning on transcription profanity masking for a user

To enable transcription profanity masking for a specific user, you can assign a policy to enable transcription profanity masking for a specific user by using the [Grant-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt798309.aspx) cmdlet.

To enable transcription profanity masking for a single user, run:

```
Grant-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy -PolicyName TranscriptionProfanityMaskingEnabled -Identity sip:amosmar@contoso.com
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The voicemail service in Office 365 caches voicemail policies and updates the cache every 4 hours. So, policy changes that you make can take up to 4 hours to be applied.
