# Document my success plan

This article gives an overview of the requirements for properly documenting your cloud voice deployment. By defining and documenting all decision points and next steps while planning your cloud voice deployment, you can make sure all stakeholders and project team members are aligned on delivering successful outcomes. 

## Execution planning 

After defining how you’ll implement the Audio Conferencing or Phone System with
Calling Plan solution in your organization, you need to plan for the execution
of the implementation project.

If your organization has only one or two sites, you might not need to complete
all the details provided in this article, but you should read through it to
guide your approach.

## Deployment model 

As with any technology implementation that transforms the way people work in
your organization, choosing the right way to undertake the deployment will
greatly influence the success of your cloud voice implementation.

Potential deployment models include the following:

-   **Per site:** This model is suitable for cases where your organization is
    geographically dispersed, and branches have significant numbers of
    employees. However, this deployment model can potentially disrupt
    communication within departments where department employees are spread
    across several locations.

-   **Per division**: This model is usually the better option for medium-size
    companies and ensures that departments involved have the same experience.

-   **Whole company at once:** This model is typically the best option for small
    companies, where all employees get the same experience from day one of the
    deployment.

## RACI modeling

To ensure that you’ve got clarity for who is responsible for what in your
project, use a responsibility assignment matrix (also known as a
RACI—responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed—matrix). List the person
or group who is responsible and accountable for each task, along with
stakeholders to be consulted in the decision-making process, and stakeholders to
be informed of each decision and action throughout the project execution.

The following is an example of a RACI matrix for a cloud voice implementation.

| Activity/Role                                         | Project Lead | Collaboration Lead/Architect | Consultant | Change Management/Adoption Specialist | Business Unit Representatives |

## Quarterly execution plan

To execute the cloud voice deployment in manageable chunks of work, we recommend
that you create a quarterly execution plan based on your objective key results
(OKRs), the deployment model you’ve chosen, and the project execution capability
of your organization.

This way you can track progress on a quarterly basis, revise the plan if needed,
and deploy cloud voice capabilities based on your organization’s capacity to
execute.

If your organization has only one or two sites, you might not need a quarterly
execution plan because you’d expect to be fully deployed in a short period of
time.

The following is an example of a quarterly execution plan for the Envision phase
of a cloud voice implementation.

| Site/division                            | Number of employees | Audio Conferencing | Phone System                    | Quarter to execute |

## Communications and governance plan

To keep project stakeholders up to date with the progress of the deployment, you
need to establish a plan for how communications will take place among the core
project team members and with the stakeholders to discuss matters relating to
status of the project, key milestones, blockers, and various reviews of the
project against established KSIs, operational metrics, and strategic goals.

The following is an example of a communications and governance plan that you can
leverage in your cloud voice implementation project.

| Type                                        | Goals                                                                                                                                                      | Participants | Days/time                                     | Location             | Meeting owner |

| Weekly steering committee                   | Review status of the cloud voice project, report to executives, raise issues that require executive help to resolve                                        | TBA          | Every Friday 11 AM PST                        | Virtual              | TBA           |
| Monthly project business/operational review | Check project status with extended stakeholders, main points of contact, and executive sponsors; review the deployment plan, KSIs, and operational metrics | TBA          | Second Tuesday of month                       | Virtual or in person | TBA           |

## Finalize my success plan

A success plan is the summary of the documentation you created in the Envision
phase.

The success plan gives the project team—which can include FastTrack or a
deployment partner—sufficient information to realize your organization’s goals
with implementing the Audio Conferencing or Phone System with Calling Plan
service.

In general, a success plan contains the following main sections, many which you
will have worked on through the Envision phase:

-   Business case

-   Service readiness

-   Service decisions

-   Execution plan

-   Adoption plan

-   Operational plan

### Business case

Business use cases, the list of stakeholders, OKRs and KSIs, risk registers, and
project timelines typically make up the bulk of information required for a
business case. You should document these as part of your success plan.

### Service readiness

Your environmental assessment provides the initial information required to
determine your organization’s technical readiness to implement Audio
Conferencing and/or Phone System with Calling Plan.

Included here is your service readiness assessment and the plan to address areas
that need remediation that you discovered through environmental assessment.

### Service decisions

Document how you planned the Audio Conferencing or Phone System with Calling
Plan service technical implementation for your organization.

### Execution plan

Document how you planned the execution of the project to implement the solution
throughout your organization.

### Adoption plan

After you perform your adoption readiness assessment, the project team needs to
come up with a comprehensive set of communication plans, a training plan, and
plans for pre-launch, launch, and post-launch adoption activities.

Identify resources to support adoption activities such as flyers, welcome
emails, and training materials, along with any customizations you’ll need to
meet your organization’s requirements.

Download templates for adoption activities from the [Microsoft Teams Customer
Success Kit](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54244).

### Operational plan

The exercise of mapping operational roles will establish roles and
responsibilities, and the teams assigned to each operational role, that you’ll
need to support the implementation of Audio Conferencing.

You need to complete this and include the operational plan as part of the
success plan to ensure operational readiness of the solution.
