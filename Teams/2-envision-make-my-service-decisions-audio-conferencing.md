# Make my service decisions

To plan for the technical implementation of Audio Conferencing, you must make a series of service decisions ahead of time to better prepare your organization to implement a solution that meets your defined business requirements.

## Audio Conferencing in Teams

As part of defining required Audio Conferencing features in Microsoft Teams, one of the first steps is to evaluate the latest public roadmap to determine:

-   Which Audio Conferencing features in Teams that will be deployed for users in scope.

-   Expected user functionality requirements for Audio Conferencing in Teams.

-   Confirmation that Audio Conferencing features in Teams described in the latest public roadmap meet your user, functionality, and scope requirements, within the timeline of your deployment.

> [!NOTE]
> The latest Teams roadmap for identifying Teams Audio Conferencing features in scope for your deployment can be found at <https://aka.ms/O365Roadmap>.

## Meetings in Teams

Teams gives your users the capability to schedule and join online meetings by using HD video, voice over IP (VoIP), and PSTN dial-in conferencing options.

Meetings can be scheduled as private meetings (only invited parties can join) or channel meetings (open for all users having access to the channel), and your users can also start impromptu meetings within channels.

> [!NOTE]
> To learn more about the features of meetings in Teams, see the [Microsoft 365 Roadmap](https://aka.ms/O365Roadmap).

Meeting participants can join your Teams meetings by dialing in to the toll or toll-free dial-in conference bridge phone numbers via landlines or mobile phones. In addition, users can let the Audio Conferencing service initiate the “call me” feature so they can participate in a meeting by having the conference bridge call their phones (useful when the data connection isn’t reliable), or let meeting organizers invite meeting participants by dialing out to their phones.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Audio Conferencing in Teams doesn’t support third-party audio conferencing providers (ACPs).

## Availability of Audio Conferencing

Before you plan for the implementation of Audio Conferencing in Teams, you need to review the availability of the Audio Conferencing service as detailed in [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to legal constraints, for Audio Conferencing to be available to multinational organizations, the contract for Office 365 subscriptions must be sourced from countries and regions where the Audio Conferencing service is commercially available.

After confirming your organization is eligible to obtain the Audio Conferencing service, compile the list of user locations or offices where you’ll implement the Audio Conferencing service, based on the list of available countries and regions.

<!--ENDOFSECTION-->

## Licensing for Audio Conferencing

An [Audio Conferencing license](teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md) is available as part of Office 365 E5 subscription plans, or as an add-on service to Office 365 E1 or Office 365 E3 subscription plans.

> [!NOTE]
> PSTN or dial-in conferencing in Teams doesn’t support third-party audio conferencing providers (ACPs).
> <br>If you already use Skype for Business Online PSTN Conferencing today, you can
immediately take advantage of Audio Conferencing in Teams.

To provide toll-free conference bridge phone numbers and to support conferencing
dial-out to international phone numbers, you must set up [Communications Credits](what-are-communications-credits.md) for your organization.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some countries are serviced by toll-free conference bridge phone numbers only. To support dial-in in these countries, you must use Communications Credits.

The first consideration when implementing Communications Credits is to decide
the initial amount of funds you want to purchase. If your organization chooses to use auto-recharge, you need to decide the trigger amount (lowest amount of funds) and the auto-recharge amount. Your actual usage will determine the auto-recharge amount. You should monitor your Communications Credits usage over time and adjust the recharge amount as necessary.

You can learn more about Communications Credits [here](what-are-communications-credits.md).

## Conference bridge phone numbers

The Audio Conferencing service in Office 365 includes:

-   Multiple types of conference bridge phone numbers (toll and toll-free)

-   Multiple categories of conference bridge phone numbers (dedicated and shared)

-   Support for multiple languages for the conference bridge (primary and secondary)

-   A default phone number for the tenant

> [!NOTE]
> Dedicated conference bridge phone numbers count toward the limit of phone numbers that can be acquired per tenant, based on the number of applicable licenses. Toll-free conference bridge phone numbers require Communications Credits.

If you must transfer existing conference bridge phone numbers to the Audio Conferencing service—assuming they meet country-specific requirements—you can transfer these existing conference bridge phone numbers to Microsoft.

> [!NOTE]
> The complexity of transferring phone numbers to Microsoft varies greatly depending on country or region, carrier, number of circuits involved, and many other contributing factors. Work with your current provider to investigate how long this is likely to take to help ensure that you start the process early enough to meet your timelines.

## Conference bridge settings

To further tailor the user experience, you can configure organization-wide options for joining Audio Conferencing meetings (meeting entry and exit notification and caller name recording), the meeting organizer’s PIN length, and email notification:

-   Meeting entry and exit notifications are available in the form of recorded name, phone number, and tones.

-   PIN length is configurable from 4 to 12 digits, with a 5-digit PIN as the default.

-   Notification emails sent on enablement of the Audio Conferencing license or any other admin-driven change are enabled by default. You can disable this feature and take control of your organization’s user communications.

For users who are assigned an Audio Conferencing license, the default toll/toll-free numbers, shown in the Audio Conferencing coordinates, can be configured to use:

-   The tenant-level default.

-   The automatically assigned conference bridge phone numbers.

-   A conference bridge phone numbers configured manually for each user.

User-specific conference bridge phone numbers are typically useful in global or nationwide organizations where users are distributed and must provide local numbers as the default conference bridge phone numbers in their meeting invitations.

Participants joining from different cities or overseas can look up additional numbers configured at the tenant level, but these numbers don’t appear directly in the meeting invitations. The meeting invitations provide a link that takes participants to the **Teams Conference Dial-in Numbers** page for them to look up the conference bridge phone number closest to their location.

You can also configure how unauthenticated callers are handled by each individual meeting organizer—whether to require the meeting organizer to start the meeting before unauthenticated callers can be admitted, or allow unauthenticated callers to start a meeting.

You can also apply additional configurations for each user to control the use of toll-free conference bridge phone numbers and dial-out from a conference.

> [!NOTE]
> These cost-related controls are currently available for preview customers only. You can enroll your organization in the preview program from https://www.skypepreview.com.

With these controls, you can decide whether meeting organizers can provide toll-free conference bridge phone numbers for meetings organized by them, and whether participants can dial out from the meetings they organized. The level of dial-out control spans from completely preventing dial out, to only allowing dial out to domestic numbers, to allowing dial out to both domestic and international numbers.

## Manage cloud voice telephone numbers

For Audio Conferencing implementation, you can choose to acquire new telephone numbers or transfer/port existing telephone numbers.

To allow users to dial phone numbers the way they’re accustomed to—such as omitting area codes for local calls, omitting country code for domestic calls, or even using short digit dialing when performing conference dial out—you can configure a customized dial plan and assign it to users.

## Acquire new telephone numbers

The two types of telephone numbers within Microsoft cloud voice solutions are:

-   Subscriber (user) numbers, which can be assigned to users in your organization.

-   Service numbers, available as toll and toll-free service numbers, which have higher concurrent call capacity than subscriber numbers and can be assigned to services such as Audio Conferencing, Auto Attendants, or Call Queues.

For more information about these types of telephone numbers, see [Different kinds of phone numbers used for Calling Plans](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/different-kinds-of-phone-numbers-used-for-calling-plans).

The total count of telephone numbers that you can obtain depend on the telephone number types and the number of licenses you have bought and assigned to your users.

When it comes to service numbers, you need to carefully plan your Audio Conferencing implementation. Evaluate whether your business requires dedicated conference bridge phone numbers; if not, your organization can opt to use shared conference bridge phone numbers.

For more information about the total count of telephone numbers that you can obtain, see [How many phone numbers can you get?](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/how-many-phone-numbers-can-you-get)

## Transfer existing telephone numbers

If your organization wants to transfer (or port) existing telephone numbers to Microsoft, you can do so by submitting a port order request to Microsoft.

You can transfer all your existing telephone numbers at once (full port), and—in some markets—you can transfer a subset of your existing telephone numbers (partial port). A partial port can be useful in cases where you just want to move your dial-in conference bridge to Audio Conferencing service.

A single port order can only transfer the telephone numbers to a single telephone number type. If you need to transfer some of your telephone numbers as subscriber numbers and some as service numbers, we recommend that you first complete the transfer to Microsoft and then perform the conversion as soon as the numbers are within Microsoft’s control.

As an alternative, if partial port is supported, you can submit multiple port requests, one port request at a time. However, this alternative approach will prolong your contract with your existing telecommunications service provider.

Telephone number porting is a complex topic and requires thorough planning, coordination, and adequately managing your stakeholders’ expectations. To learn more, see the following articles:

-   [Transferring phone numbers to Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/transfer-phone-numbers-to-office-365)

## Dial plans

A Dial Plan in the Phone System feature of Office 365 is a set of normalization rules that translates dialed phone numbers into an alternate format (typically E.164 format) for call authorization and call routing. The Audio Conferencing service leverages the same capabilities used by Phone System to translate dialed phone numbers in conference dial-out scenarios (for example, invite participants via PSTN and dial back, “call me” feature).

In the Phone System feature of Office 365, there are two types of dial plans:

-   **Service dial plan:** This is the default dial plan that’s applied to users based on their Office 365 usage location, and it can’t be modified.

-   **Tenant dial plan:** This is a customizable dial plan within a tenant, which is further divided into two types:

    -   **Tenant-global dial plan:** The dial plan that applies to all users in the tenant.

    -   **Tenant-user dial plan:** The dial plan that applies only to specific users.

The effective dial plan assigned to users is the combination of the service dial plan (based on a user’s Office 365 usage location) and tenant dial plan (can be either tenant-global dial plan or tenant-user dial plan).

![Table shows three combinations of service and tenant dial plans.](media/audio_conferencing_image8.png "Table shows three combinations of service and tenant dial plans.")

> [!Important]
> There can be a maximum of 25 normalization rules in each tenant dial plan; therefore, it’s important to avoid duplicating normalization rules that are already available as part of the service dial plan.

To learn more about dial plans, see [What are dial plans?](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/what-are-dial-plans)
