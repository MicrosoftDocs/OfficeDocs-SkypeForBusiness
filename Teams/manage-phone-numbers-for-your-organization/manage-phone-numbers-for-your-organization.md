# Manage phone numbers for your organization
There are three ways to get both user and service (toll and toll-free) numbers for your organization.
- Get numbers in the Skype for Business admin center.
- Use a request form for new numbers that aren't listed in the Skype for Business admin center.
- Transfer or "port" your existing numbers over to us.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In **Belgium, Ireland, Germany, and the Netherlands**, you can't get phone new phone numbers using the **Skype for Business admin center**; you have to download and fill out a form. For new phone numbers in Australia, see [Telstra Voice Services](https://aka.ms/TelstraVoicePlan).

## Here's a bit more information about these number request forms
### Request forms for new phone numbers
Each country or region has different instructions, different types of numbers (geographic/non-geographic and service (toll/toll-free) and rules/regulations for getting phone numbers so they can be used in Skype for Business Online and Microsoft Teams.

Sometimes (depending on your country/region) you won't be able to get new user (subscriber) or service (toll or toll-free) numbers using the **Skype for Business admin center**, or you might need specific phone numbers or area codes.

If so, you will need to download the correct PDF form (per country/region and the type of numbers) and send it back to us. Our service desk will take it from there and will let you know about the progress or your order.

### Letters of Authorization (LOAs) for transferring numbers
If you need to transfer phone numbers, you'll to download a **Letter of Authorization (LOA)**, which gives us permission to request, on your behalf, transferring the existing number(s) from a different service provider in case of a dispute. Use an LOA if you have:
- User numbers that you already have from another carrier.
- Service (toll) numbers for audio conferencing bridges, auto attendants or call queues.
- Service (toll-free) phone numbers.
- You have more than 999 user phone numbers that you need to get but can't get in the Skype for Business admin center using the use the **Local Number Porting wizard**.
