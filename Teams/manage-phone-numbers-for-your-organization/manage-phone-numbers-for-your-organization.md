# Manage phone numbers for your organization

There are four ways to get user (subscriber) and service (toll and toll-free) phone numbers for your organization:
- [Getting new user phone numbers in the Microsoft Teams admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/getting-phone-numbers-for-your-users#get-new-phone-numbers-for-your-users).
- [Getting new service phone numbers in the Microsoft Teams Admin Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/getting-service-phone-numbers#get-new-service-numbers).
- [Transfer or _Port_ your existing phone numbers with us](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/phone-number-calling-plans/transfer-phone-numbers-to-teams#create-a-port-order-and-transfer-your-phone-numbers-to-teams).
- Use a request form for new phone numbers that aren't listed in the Microsoft Teams admin center.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For new phone numbers in Australia, see [Telstra Voice Services](https://aka.ms/TelstraVoicePlan). For new phone numbers in Japan, see [SoftBank Voice Services](https://aka.ms/SoftBankVoicePlan).

## Here's a bit more information about these number request forms

### Request forms for new phone numbers

Each country or region has different instructions, different types of phone numbers (geographic/non-geographic and service (toll/toll-free)) and rules/regulations for getting phone numbers so they can be used in Microsoft Teams.

Sometimes (depending on your country or region) you won't be able to get new user (subscriber) or service (toll or toll-free) phone numbers using the Microsoft Teams admin center or you might need _specific_ phone numbers (vanity requests) or _specific_ area codes.

If so, you will need to download the correct PDF LOA form (per country or region and type of phone numbers) and send it back to us. Our service desk will take it from there and start processing your request.

### Letters of Authorization (LOAs) to transfer/port existing phone numbers from another service provider to Microsoft Teams

If you need to transfer/port your existing phone numbers, you will need to download, fill and send us a Letter of Authorization (LOA), which gives us permission to request and transfer, on your behalf, those existing numbers from a different service provider into Microsoft Teams.

Please send us an **LOA** if you currently have the following with another carrier:
- User (subscriber) numbers.
- Service (toll) numbers for audio conferencing bridges, auto attendants, or call queues.
- Toll-Free phone numbers.
- More than 999 user phone numbers that you need to transfer/port but can't get in the Microsoft Teams admin center using the local number porting wizard.

Once you have your **filled and signed** LOA, please [contact our PSTN Service Desk](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/contact-pstn-service-desk) so we can assist you.
