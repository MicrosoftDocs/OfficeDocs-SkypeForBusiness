# Phone number management for Australia

In Australia, we've partnered with Telstra for the purchase and provisioning of Calling Plans for customers with a billing address in Australia. Telstra will sell their Calling Plans and provide Australian user numbers. Telstra provides the support for phone number management for both user and service numbers for auto attendants and call queues. However, service numbers and licenses for Audio Conferencing will still be sold and managed by Microsoft 365 and Office 365.

For more information on the [Telstra Calling](https://aka.ms/TelstraVoicePlan).
