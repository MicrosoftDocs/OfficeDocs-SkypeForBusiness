# Message Escalations (may 19)

## Message Escalation overview

Message escalation is the next level to apply when Priority Notifications haven't gotten a prompt response. 

*Usage example, without message escalation:* Jakob Roth is admitted with a small infection on his arm. Lena Ehrle, the ER doctor, admits Jakob and calls Franco Piccio, the doctor who runs the ward Jacob will be transferred to when possible. Lena leaves Franco a priority notification voice message expressing concern about the infection but doesn't get a response. Two hours later, Franco still hasn't responded and the infection had spread to Jakob's entire arm and the situation is much worse. Fortunately, Jakob recovers. The incident leads to implementing new features.

*Usage example, with message escalation:* A week later, Jakob Roth is readmitted, this time with a deep cut on his foot. Again Lena admits him and contacts Franco to transfer Jakob into the proper ward. Again, Franco doesn't respond to the voice message, but after 10 minutes Lena tries to contact him in chat and sees that he's unavailable in surgery for the next 4 hours and his delegate is Dr. 
Laura Heinrich, so Lena contacts Dr. Heinrich instead.  

Jakob is pretty accident prone, we certainly hope his insurance is good.
