# Virtual visits with Microsoft Teams and the Bookings app

The Bookings app in Microsoft Teams offers a simple way to schedule in-person and virtual appointments, such as healthcare visits, financial consultations, interviews, customer support, education office hours, and much more.

Schedulers can manage multiple department and staff calendars, as well as communications with internal and external attendees, from a single experience. The virtual appointments themselves are held via Microsoft Teams Meetings, which offers robust videoconferencing capabilities.

> [!NOTE]
> Only schedulers need to have the Bookings app installed in Teams. Staff conducting or participating in virtual appointments do not need the app. They can simply join appointments from their Outlook or Teams calendar or from a link in their booking confirmation email.

## Prerequisites for using the Bookings app in Teams

- The Exchange mailbox must be in Exchange Online. On-premises Exchange Server mailboxes are not supported.

- Microsoft Bookings must be turned on for the organization.

- Users must have an appropriate license. Office 365 A3, A5, E3, and E5, as well as Microsoft 365 Business Standard, A3, A5, E3, and E5 are supported.

- All users of the Bookings app and all staff participating in meetings must have a license that supports Teams Meeting scheduling.

- Your systems must meet all [Software and browser prerequisites](hardware-requirements-for-the-teams-app.md).

## Availability of Bookings in Teams

Microsoft Bookings App for Teams is available on the desktop and web. It can be found under [Apps within Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/4c4ec2e8-4a2c-4bce-8d8f-00fc664a4e5b?source=store-copy-link) and under **Manage Apps** within Teams Admin Center.

### Control access to Bookings within your organization

There are several ways to control who has access to the Bookings app and to specific features of the app. To learn how to turn Microsoft Bookings on or off in the Microsoft 365 admin center, as well as how to create a Bookings app policy to allow selected users to create Bookings calendars, see [Get access to Microsoft Bookings](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-access-to-microsoft-bookings-5382dc07-aaa5-45c9-8767-502333b214ce). You can also learn how to [Create a Teams app policy to pin the Bookings app for select users](teams-app-setup-policies.md).

## Recommended Meeting Policy Settings

To enable the best experience for Bookings, create a staff meeting policy to automatically admit **Everyone in your organization**. This will allow staff to join the appointment automatically and enable lobby experience for external attendees. You can learn more about [automatically admitting people to meetings](meeting-policies-participants-and-guests.md#automatically-admit-people).

### Optional staff approvals setting

As an extra privacy setting, you can choose to require staff to opt in before their schedule availability information is shared through Bookings and before they can be booked for an appointment.  

To enable this setting, go to **Microsoft 365 admin center** \> **Settings** \> **Settings**, then select **Bookings**.

With this setting turned on, staff will receive an email in which they are asked to approve membership to a booking calendar.  

This feature is gradually being rolled out worldwide to Microsoft 365 and Office 365 customers. If all options are not yet available in your environment, check back soon.

## Changing your default domain when setting up Bookings mailboxes

When setting up a Bookings mailbox, the default email domain of your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 organization is used. However, this can cause problems when sending meeting invites to external recipients; your invite might be flagged as spam and moved to the recipientâ€™s junk folder, so the recipient might never see your invite.

We recommend that you change the default domain prior to creating your Bookings mailbox. For information on how to do this, see the [Domains FAQ](/microsoft-365/admin/setup/domains-faq#how-do-i-set-or-change-the-default-domain-in-office-365).

If you need to change the default domain after your Bookings mailbox has already been created, you can do so with PowerShell:

```PowerShell
Set-Mailbox -identity business@domain.onmicrosoft.com -WindowsEmailAddress business@domain.com -EmailAddresses business@domain.com
```

For more information, see the PowerShell documentation for the [Set-Mailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/mailboxes/set-mailbox) cmdlet.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using an Exchange hybrid configuration, we recommend that you thoroughly test mail flow between on-premises Exchange and Exchange Online when changing the default domain.
