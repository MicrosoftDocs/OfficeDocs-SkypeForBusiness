Explanation of all External user settings:

	• Guest users permission are limited: Get guest become scope administrator of the tenant or application level  - Delegated access to user or group to perform administrative functions to user or OU. Can you delegate  - Groups/Teams don’t use this

	• Admins and users in the guest inviter role can invite - PowerShell AAD or Portal try to add guest - that won't impact Teams

	• Members can invite - Teams Owners - No owners of Team or groups (developers working on this setting and user feedback to make errors clearer.) 

	• Guests can invite – not used in Groups/Teams at this time.


□ SharePoint Specific Settings
	1. Login to O365 admin center 
	2. Click on Admin Center and select SharePoint.
	3. From within the SharePoint admin center, select ‘Sharing’.
