# Microsoft StaffHub has been retired

Effective June 30, 2020, Microsoft StaffHub has been retired. We're building StaffHub capabilities into Microsoft Teams. Today, Teams includes the Shifts app for schedule management and additional capabilities will roll out over time.

These changes are part of our continued efforts to empower every employee with Microsoft 365. With capabilities for Frontline Workers now in Teams, every employee in your organization will be able to use Teams to streamline their workday, collaborate with coworkers, and access information and expertise to help them do their best work.

## Frequently asked questions

### About StaffHub retirement

#### When will StaffHub be retired?

Microsoft StaffHub has been retired, effective June 30, 2020.

#### What will happen once StaffHub is retired?

StaffHub stopped working for all users on June 30, 2020. Anyone who tries to open the app is shown a message directing them to download Teams.

#### Will Teams offer all the functionality currently offered in StaffHub?

In January 2019, Teams began offering Shifts which was previously available in Microsoft StaffHub. This feature allows managers to plan and distribute shift schedules, and team members the opportunity to review their schedule and make schedule change requests from their mobile devices. To learn more, see [Manage the Shifts app for your organization in Teams](manage-the-shifts-app-for-your-organization-in-teams.md).

We're committed to delivering a superior user experience and bringing the unique capabilities of StaffHub to Teams.

#### Why can't users in my organization access their StaffHub team from Shifts in Teams?

To access a StaffHub team from Shifts in Teams, you had to move the StaffHub team to Teams before June 30, 2020, which is  when StaffHub was retired.

#### What happens if I didn't move a StaffHub team to Shifts in Teams?

Teams that were created using StaffHub and weren't moved to Teams can no longer be viewed or moved effective June 30, 2020 when StaffHub was retired. However, you can start using Teams any time and create a shift schedule in the Shifts app.

If you had a StaffHub team associated to an Office 365 group that you didn't move to Teams and you now want to create a Teams Shifts schedule associated to that Office 365 group, contact Support.

### About Shifts

#### What is Shifts?

The Shifts app in Teams is a schedule management tool that keeps Frontline Workers connected and in sync. Managers create, update, and manage shift schedules for teams, and team members can view their schedules, see who else is scheduled for the day, request to swap or offer a shift, and request time off, all from their mobile devices.  

#### Which plans is Shifts available in?

Shifts is available in all Enterprise SKUs where Teams is available.

#### How do I get Shifts? 

If you're already on a plan that includes Shifts, you can start using Shifts today as part of Teams. Check out [Get started in Shifts](https://support.office.com/article/get-started-in-shifts-5f3e30d8-1821-4904-be26-c3cd25a497d6).

#### Which devices or platforms is Shifts available on?

Shifts is available on the Teams web client, Teams desktop client, and Teams mobile clients (iOS and Android).
 
#### Are there differences between the Shifts desktop and web apps and the mobile (iOS and Android) apps?

For managers, the desktop and web apps are optimized to create teams, add members, build and publish schedules, and share content with the team. Managers generally use the mobile app to approve requests, send quick messages to the team, call a team member, and collaborate on the go. 

For team members, the mobile app is optimized to view their schedule, see who they're working with on a day, clock in and out, set availability, request time off, swap or offer shifts and open shifts. There are differences in what users can do in the desktop and web apps versus the mobile apps. We're working on feature parity.

#### Are there differences between the Shifts iOS app and the Android app?

Core functionality is the same between the Shifts iOS and Android apps. There are minor UI differences between the two apps to align to their recommended design patterns.

#### What browsers does Shifts work on?

Shifts works on all the browsers that Teams supports which includes the latest versions of Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox. For more information, see [Get clients for Teams](../../get-clients.md).

> [!Note]
> Microsoft 365 apps and services will not support Internet Explorer 11 starting August 17, 2021 (Microsoft Teams will not support Internet Explorer 11 earlier, starting  November 30, 2020). [Learn more](https://aka.ms/AA97tsw). Please note that Internet Explorer 11 will remain a supported browser. Internet Explorer 11 is a component of the Windows operating system and [follows the Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/faq/internet-explorer-microsoft-edge) for the product on which it is  installed. 

#### What languages does Shifts support?

Shifts is available in the following languages: Chinese-Simplified, English (U.S.), Spanish, Russian, Japanese, French, Brazilian-Portuguese, German, Korean, Italian, Chinese-Traditional, Dutch, Turkish, Swedish, Danish, and Norwegian. We plan to add support for additional languages in the future.  

#### Where is Shifts data stored?

Shifts data is stored in Azure in data centers in North America and Western Europe. SharePoint content leverages Microsoft 365 Groups and uses the same storage and support.

For more information, see [Location of Shifts data](manage-the-shifts-app-for-your-organization-in-teams.md#location-of-shifts-data).

#### What licenses do I need for Teams?

Each user must have an active Microsoft 365 or Office 365 license from an eligible plan and must be assigned a Teams license. 

#### How do I enable Teams in my organization?

By default, Teams is enabled for all organizations. You assign Teams licenses to users to control individual access to Teams. For more information, see [Enable Teams in your organization](../../Office-365-set-up.md) and [Manage user access to Teams](../../user-access.md).

#### What if I currently have Skype for Business enabled in my organization but not Teams?

Teams supports coexistence with Skype for Business. For more information, see [Understand Teams and Skype for Business coexistence and interoperability](../../teams-and-skypeforbusiness-coexistence-and-interoperability.md) and [Migration and interoperability guidance for organizations using Teams together with Skype for Business](../../migration-interop-guidance-for-teams-with-skype.md).

#### Does each user need to have a Microsoft 365 or Office 365 account or Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account?

Yes, each manager and team member using Teams and Shifts within Teams must have a Microsoft 365 or Office 365 account (Azure AD) and must be assigned a valid license.

#### Can I export shift schedules from Shifts?
  
You can export shift schedule information to an Excel file from the Shifts desktop and web apps. You can then import this information to your organization's systems and tools.

#### How can I recover a schedule if I accidentally deleted a team?

Deleting a schedule is linked to deleting a team. If you recover a team, the schedule isn't recovered.

#### What powers the file sharing capability in Teams? Where are files stored?

The file sharing capability, the ability for a manager to distribute files to team members, is powered on the back end by SharePoint Online. When a team is created, a Microsoft 365 Group is automatically provisioned for that team in the background.

To learn more, see [How SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business interact with Teams](../../SharePoint-OneDrive-interact.md).
 
#### Is there integration between Shifts and the Outlook calendar? Can I export a schedule to a calendar?
 
Frontline Workers can see their entire work schedule at a glance in Shifts. We'll be supporting native integration with Outlook calendar as part of our roadmap. In the meantime, use Microsoft Flow to set up integration with Shifts in Teams and Outlook and Google calendars.
 
#### What admin controls are available to manage whether users in my organization can use Shifts?  
  
You can turn on or turn off Shifts org-wide for all users in your organization. In the Microsoft Teams admin center, you can also use the Frontline Worker app setup policy to customize Teams for your Frontline Workforce. The policy is configured with the Activity, Shifts, Chat, and Calling apps. Assigning the policy pins these apps to the app bar in Teams for quick and easy access by users. 

To learn more, see [Manage the Shifts app for your organization in Teams](manage-the-shifts-app-for-your-organization-in-teams.md).

#### What PowerShell controls are available for Teams?

You manage Teams through the Microsoft Teams PowerShell module and the Skype for Business PowerShell module. For more information, see [Teams PowerShell Overview](../../teams-powershell-overview.md). At this time, there are no specific PowerShell cmdlets available to manage Shifts.  

If this is something you're interested in, send us a request through the [Teams feedback portal on UserVoice](https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public-preview/category/182881-developer-platform).

#### Is reporting available to view Shifts usage across my organization?

Because Shifts is an app in Teams, you can view usage through Teams reports. For more information, check out [Teams reporting in the Microsoft Teams admin center](../../teams-analytics-and-reports/teams-reporting-reference.md) and [Teams activity reports in the Microsoft 365 admin center](../../teams-activity-reports.md).

#### Where can I provide feedback?
  
In the mobile app, tap **More** in the upper left of the screen, go to **Settings** > **Send feedback** or **Report an issue**. Similarly, in the desktop and web apps, in the lower left of the screen, go **Help** > **Share an idea** or **Report an issue**.
