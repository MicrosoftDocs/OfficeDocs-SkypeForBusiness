# Install the Microsoft StaffHub PowerShell module

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Effective October 1, 2019, Microsoft StaffHub will be retired. We’re building StaffHub capabilities into Microsoft Teams. Today, Teams includes the Shifts app for schedule management and additional capabilities will roll out over time. StaffHub will stop working for all users on October 1, 2019. Anyone who tries to open StaffHub will be shown a message directing them to download Teams. To learn more, see [Microsoft StaffHub to be retired](microsoft-staffhub-to-be-retired.md).  

Use the steps in this article to install and connect to the Microsoft StaffHub PowerShell module. You'll need this to manage StaffHub by using PowerShell and to move your StaffHub teams to Microsoft Teams.

## Install the Microsoft StaffHub PowerShell module

1. Download the [StaffHub PowerShell module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MicrosoftStaffHub/1.0.0-alpha). 
2. Open Windows PowerShell 3.0 or later as an admin. To do this, click **Start**, type **Windows PowerShell**, right-click **Windows PowerShell**, and then select **Run as administrator**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > To get the latest version of Windows PowerShell, see [Installing Windows PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-windows-powershell). 
3. Run the following:

    ```
    $ENV:PSModulePath
    ```
    

4. Check the folder path in the output and make sure that all folders in the path exist on your computer before you go to the next step. If folders are missing, create them.
5. Run the following to allow for installation of the StaffHub PowerShell module:

    ```
    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

6. Run the following, where &lt;path&gt; is the path in the output from step 2. For example, the path might look like C:\Users\User1\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules.

    Be sure to run each command separately.

    ```
    Save-Module -Name PowerShellGet -Path <path> -RequiredVersion 1.6.6
    Install-Module -Name PackageManagement -Force  -AllowClobber
    Install-Module -Name PowerShellGet -Force  -AllowClobber
    Save-Module -Name MicrosoftStaffHub -Path <path> -RequiredVersion 1.0.5-alpha -AllowPrerelease

7. Exit Windows PowerShell.
