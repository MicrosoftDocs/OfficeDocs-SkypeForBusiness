# Plan to move your StaffHub teams to Shifts in Microsoft Teams

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Effective October 1, 2019, Microsoft StaffHub will be retired. We’re building StaffHub capabilities into Microsoft Teams. Today, Teams includes the Shifts app for schedule management and additional capabilities will roll out over time. StaffHub will stop working for all users on October 1, 2019. Anyone who tries to open StaffHub will be shown a message directing them to download Teams. To learn more, see [Microsoft StaffHub to be retired](microsoft-staffhub-to-be-retired.md). 

Making the transition from StaffHub to Teams begins when you start planning for the change. To help ensure your move to Teams is successful, we've created a sample  timeline that demonstrates a typical transition plan. The sample timeline outlines planning activities to prepare for the move and takes you through to moving your organization's StaffHub teams to Teams.

Use the timeline as guidance and customize it according to the needs of your organization. Be sure to review the resources that are linked to each step in the timeline.
