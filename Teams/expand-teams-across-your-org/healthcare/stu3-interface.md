# STU3 interface specification

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Effective October 30, 2020, the Patients app will be deprecated and users will no longer be able to 
>install it from the Teams app store. We encourage you to start using the [Lists app](https://support.microsoft.com/office/get-started-with-lists-in-teams-c971e46b-b36c-491b-9c35-efeddd0297db) in Teams today.**
>
>Patients app data is stored in the group mailbox of the Office 365 group that backs the team. When the Patients app is retired, all data associated with it will be retained in this group but can no longer be accessed through the user interface. Current users can re-create their lists using the [Lists app](https://support.microsoft.com/office/get-started-with-lists-in-teams-c971e46b-b36c-491b-9c35-efeddd0297db).
>
>The [Lists app](https://support.microsoft.com/office/get-started-with-lists-in-teams-c971e46b-b36c-491b-9c35-efeddd0297db) is pre-installed for all Teams users and is available as a tab in every team and channel. With Lists, care teams can create patient lists using the built-in Patients template, from scratch, or by importing data to Excel. To learn more about how to manage the Lists app in your organization, see [Manage the Lists app](../../manage-lists-app.md).

[!INCLUDE [preview-feature](../../includes/preview-feature.md)]

Setting up or reconfiguring an FHIR server to work with the Microsoft Teams Patients app requires understanding what data the app needs to access. The FHIR server must support POST requests using bundles for the following resources:

- [Patient](#patient)
- [Observation](#observation)
- [Condition](#condition)
- [Encounter](#encounter)
- [Allergy Intolerance](#allergyintolerance)
- [Coverage](#coverage)
- [Medication Statement](#medication-request) (replaces the MedicationOrder in the DSTU2 version of the PatientsApp)
- Location (the information needed from this resource can be included in Encounter)

> [!NOTE]
> The Patient resource is the only mandatory resource (without which the app will not load at all); However, it is recommended that the Partner implement support for all the above mentioned resources per specifications provided below for the best end-user experience with the Microsoft Teams Patients App.

Queries from the Microsoft Teams Patients app for more than one resource shall post a bundle (BATCH) of requests to the FHIR server's URL. The server shall process each request and return a bundle of the resources matched by each request. For more information and examples, see [https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/http.html#transaction](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/http.html#transaction).

## Capability Statement

These are the minimum required fields:

1. REST
   1. Mode
   2. Interaction
   3. Resource: Type
   4. Security: [Extension for OAuth URIs](https://hl7.org/fhir/extension-oauth-uris.html)
2. FhirVersion (Our code requires this to understand which version we should pivot to.)

See [https://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/capabilitystatement.html](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/capabilitystatement.html) for other details on this field set.

## Patient

Here are the minimum required fields, which are a subset of the Argonaut patient profile fields:

1. Name.Given
2. Name.Family
3. Gender
4. BirthDate
5. MRN (Identifier)

In addition to the [Argonaut fields](http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/StructureDefinition-argo-patient.html), for a great user experience the Patients app can also read the following fields:

1. Name.Use
2. Name.Prefix
3. [GeneralPractitioner] - The GeneralPractitioner reference should be included in the Patient resource (display field only)

A resource search uses the POST method at /Patient/_search and the following parameters:

1. id
2. family=(searches for all patients whose family name contains the value)
3. given=\<substring>
4. birthdate=(exact match)
5. gender=(values being one of the administrative-gender)
6. \_count (maximum number of results that should be returned) <br> The response should contain the total count of records returned as a result of the search and \_count will be used by the PatientsApp to limit the number of records returned.
7. identifier=\<mrn>

The goal is to be able to search and filter for a patient by the following:

- ID: This is the resource ID that every resource in FHIR has.
- MRN: This is the actual identifier for the patient that clinical staff would know. We understand this MRN is based on the type of identifier inside the identifier resource in FHIR.
- Name
- Birthdate

See the following example of the call:

## Observation

These are the minimum required fields, which are a subset of the [Argonaut Vital-Signs profile](https://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/StructureDefinition-argo-vitalsigns.html).

3. ValueQuantity.Value

In addition to the Argonaut fields, for a great user experience the Patients app can also read the following fields:

1. Code.Coding.Display
2. ValueQuantity.Unit

A resource search uses the GET method and the following parameters:

1. patient=\<patient id>
2. _sort=-date
3. category (we will query for "category=vital-signs") to retrieve the list of vital signs.

Refer to this example of the call:

2. Type[0].Coding[0].Display

In addition, the following fields from US Core Encounter profile's "must support" fields:

1. Period.Start
2. Location[0].Location.Display

A resource search uses the GET method and the following parameters:

1. patient=\<patient id>
2. _sort:desc=\<field ex. date>
3. _count=\<max results>

The goal is to be able to retrieve the patient's last known location. Each encounter references a location resource. The reference shall also include the location's display field.
