# Audit logs for Patients app

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Effective October 30, 2020, the Patients app will be deprecated and users will no longer be able to 
>install it from the Teams app store. We encourage you to start using the [Lists app](https://support.microsoft.com/office/get-started-with-lists-in-teams-c971e46b-b36c-491b-9c35-efeddd0297db) in Teams today.**
>
>Patients app data is stored in the group mailbox of the Office 365 group that backs the team. When the Patients app is retired, all data associated with it will be retained in this group but can no longer be accessed through the user interface. Current users can re-create their lists using the [Lists app](https://support.microsoft.com/office/get-started-with-lists-in-teams-c971e46b-b36c-491b-9c35-efeddd0297db).

>The [Lists app](https://support.microsoft.com/office/get-started-with-lists-in-teams-c971e46b-b36c-491b-9c35-efeddd0297db) is pre-installed for all Teams users and is available as a tab in every team and channel. With Lists, care teams can create patient lists using the built-in Patients template, from scratch, or by importing data to Excel. To learn more about how to manage the Lists app in your organization, see [Manage the Lists app](../../manage-lists-app.md).

An Audit log for Patients app activity allows after-incident response teams to review changes to a patient's Electronic Medical Records (EMR) or Patient Healthcare Information (PHI) and determine if changes or improvements in policy or procedure for PHI access in productivity tools are needed. The audit log events cover actions performed through the Patients app user interface.

## Meet HIPAA requirements

According to HIPAA guidelines, healthcare providers are required to keep records of all access to PHI, so that it is possible for the changes to be audited. Microsoft is committed to its enterprise customers using Microsoft Teams, and to helping them meet HIPAA requirements and controls. Access to PHI via the Patients App is fully tracked and logs are made available in the Microsoft 365 Compliance center, as described in the [Audit Log Search functionality](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance) article.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The burden of maintaining patient privacy is placed on the healthcare provider by law. The law entitles patients to privacy, and requires that an IT admin or HIPAA controller can easily determine which nurse, clinician, or social worker accessed or altered patient records. One of the most common examples of a PHI access violation is access to VIP patients. The audit log functionality is required to conduct investigations of any PHI access violation, and to meet HIPAA requirements.

## Enable Audit logs for the Patients App

An Audit is dependent on several prior configurations:

1. The admin would have to work with their FHIR service provider to have EMR in a format used by the Patients App. See [Integrating Electronic Healthcare Records into Microsoft Teams](patients-app.md).
2. A healthcare provider admin would have to enable the patients app in Teams Admin center. See [Manage app setup policies in Microsoft Teams](../../teams-app-setup-policies.md) and related articles for more information.
3. The admin would have to enable activity audits, the same way they enable any activity log audit, as described in [Before you begin](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance#before-you-begin) and [Turn audit log search on or off](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/turn-audit-log-search-on-or-off#turn-on-audit-log-search). If audit logging is already on, nothing special is needed for the Patients App. Any time a healthcare provider installs and runs the app within a Team, the audit logs record their PHI activity.
4. The admin would then need to announce availability of the Patients app, and Healthcare workers would have to start generating activity to be included in an audit.
