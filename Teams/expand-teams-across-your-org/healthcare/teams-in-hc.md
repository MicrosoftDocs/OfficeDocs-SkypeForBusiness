# Get started with Teams for Healthcare organizations

Microsoft Teams offers a number of features useful for hospitals and other Healthcare organizations. Teams features are under development to aid hospitals with:

- Care Coordination
- Secure Messaging
- Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR) integration
- Firstline Worker integration

## Care Coordination

Care coordination is one of the key pillars for our investments in Microsoft Teams in healthcare. The solution gives healthcare teams a secure hub for coordinating care across multiple patients. It integrates with electronic health records (EHR) systems and enables care providers to communicate about patient care in real-time within Teams’ secure platform. Teams allows organizations to address problems like:

- Low efficiency in hand-offs and critical communication throughout the care continuum
- Siloed information that creates administrative burden in the healthcare system
- Dissatisfaction among clinicians with complex and fragmented collaboration tools
- Inefficient and in-person coordination among professionals that can consume too much clinical time and cost

New templates for creating Teams were developed to apply to a Hospital setting, and more are expected soon. This makes it easier to create Teams that Healthcare workers use to coordinate care for patients in various departments or wards. See [Get started with Teams templates for Healthcare organizations](healthcare-templates.md). Teams can be started for internal departments such as cardiology, or for care wards, and more templates are in development.

## Secure Messaging

Secure messaging supports collaboration within care teams, including several new features:

- A message sender can set a special priority for their message, so the recipient is repeatedly notified until they read the message.
- A message sender can request a read receipt, so they are notified when a message they sent was read by the message recipient.

Together, these features allow quicker attention to urgent messages and confidence that the message was received and read. New care teams using these features can be created on a per-patient basis. These features are policy-based, and can be assigned to individuals or entire Teams.

See [Get started with Secure Messaging policies for Healthcare organizations](messaging-policies-hc.md) for further details.

## Firstline Worker integration

Microsoft Teams integrates with Firstline Worker, which can be used to coordinate shift staffing features and more.
