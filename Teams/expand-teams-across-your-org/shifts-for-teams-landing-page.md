# Shifts for Teams

Shifts, the schedule management tool in Teams, keeps your frontline workforce connected and in sync. It's built mobile first for fast and effective schedule management and communications. With Shifts, frontline managers and workers can seamlessly manage schedules and keep in touch.

Managers can create, update, and manage shift schedules for their teams. They can assign shifts, add open shifts, and approve schedule requests from employees. Employees can view their own and their team's schedules, set their availability, request to swap or offer a shift, request time off, and clock in and out.

| <img src="/office/media/icons/api.png" alt="Three gears - API."> | **[Shift Graph APIs](/graph/api/resources/shift)** Shifts Graph APIs allow you to integrate Shifts data with external workforce management systems. You'll have the flexibility to build custom Shifts experiences in the back end, while giving users a rich, front-end experience in Teams.             |
| <img src="/office/media/icons/api.png" alt="Three gears - API.">| **[Workforce management integrations](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Shifts-WFM-Connectors)** If you're using third-party workforce management systems, such as Kronos and JDA, for scheduling, time, and attendance, you can integrate directly with Shifts through Shifts Graph APIs and SDK with open-source integrations. |
|<img src="/office/media/icons/process-flow-teams.png" alt="Process/flow chart symbol."> | **[Shifts + Power Automate](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Shifts-Power-Automate-Templates)** Shifts + Power Automate lets you take info from Shifts and create custom workflows with other apps and perform operations at scale. Automate key processes with little to no code. The triggers and templates support various scenarios such as enabling auto-approvals for shift requests when a managerâ€™s approval isn't needed. |
