# Walkie Talkie app in Microsoft Teams

## Overview of Walkie Talkie

The Walkie Talkie app in Teams provides instant push-to-talk (PTT) communication for your team and is available on Android and iOS. Walkie Talkie allows users to connect with their team using the same underlying channels they're members of.

Only users who connect to Walkie Talkie in a channel become participants and can communicate with each other by using PTT. Users continue to receive transmissions until they tap **Stop listening**. Walkie Talkie supports communicating in standard, open channels. It doesn't support or work on shared and private channels.

With Walkie Talkie in Teams, users can securely communicate with a familiar PTT experience without needing to carry bulky radios, and Walkie Talkie works anywhere with WiFi or cellular internet connectivity.

> [!NOTE]
> Walkie Talkie currently is not available in China.

## License requirements

Walkie Talkie is included in all paid licenses of Teams in [Microsoft 365 and Office 365 subscriptions](/office365/servicedescriptions/teams-service-description). For more information about getting Teams, check out [How do I get Microsoft Teams?](https://support.office.com/article/fc7f1634-abd3-4f26-a597-9df16e4ca65b)

## Deploying Walkie Talkie

You can deploy and manage Walkie Talkie from the Teams admin center. Walkie Talkie is supported on Android devices with Google Mobile Services (GMS) and iOS devices.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Deployment is a three-step process. You'll need to complete all three steps for your users to have access to Walkie Talkie.

### Step 1: Make sure Walkie Talkie is enabled in your organization

You control whether the app is available at the organization level on the [Manage apps](manage-apps.md) page in the Microsoft Teams admin center. To confirm that the app is enabled in your organization:

1. In the left navigation of the Teams admin center, go to **Teams apps** > **Manage apps**.
2. In the list of apps, search for the Walkie Talkie app, select it, and then make sure the **Status** toggle is set to **Allowed**.

### Step 2: Create and assign an app permission policy

Control which users in your organization can use Walkie Talkie by assigning app permission policies in the Teams admin center. To learn more, see [Manage app permission policies in Teams](teams-app-permission-policies.md).

Make sure that Walkie Talkie is an allowed app in the app permission policy, and that you assign the policy to all users who need Walkie Talkie.

### Step 3: Use an app setup policy to pin Walkie Talkie for your users

Step 3 depends on which license your users have.

- [If your users have E licenses](#e-license-use-an-app-setup-policy-to-pin-walkie-talkie-to-teams)
- [If your users have F licenses](#f-license-use-the-tailored-frontline-app-experience-to-pin-walkie-talkie-and-other-apps-to-teams)

#### E license: Use an app setup policy to pin Walkie Talkie to Teams

App setup policies let you customize Teams to pin apps that are most important for your users in your users.

To pin the Walkie Talkie app for your users, you can edit the global (Org-wide default) policy or create and assign a custom policy in app setup policy. To learn more, see [Manage app setup policies in Teams](teams-app-setup-policies.md).

#### F license: Use the Tailored frontline app experience to pin Walkie Talkie and other apps to Teams

The tailored frontline app experience in Teams pins the most relevant apps in Teams for users who have an [F license](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/frontline#office-SKUChooser-0dbn8nt). Pinned apps include Walkie Talkie, Shifts, Tasks, and Approvals. By default, this feature is on, giving your frontline workers an out-of-the-box experience that's tailored to their needs.

The apps are pinned to the app bar at the bottom of Teams mobile clients where users can quickly and easily access them.

To learn more, including how the experience works with app policies that you set, see [Tailor Teams apps for your frontline workers](/microsoft-365/frontline/pin-teams-apps-based-on-license?bc=%2fmicrosoftteams%2fbreadcrumb%2ftoc.json&toc=%2fmicrosoftteams%2ftoc.json).

## Network considerations

Walkie Talkie in Teams requires internet connectivity. The following network conditions are required for an optimal experience.

|Metric | Required |
|---|---|
|Latency (RTT) | < 300 ms |
|Jitter |< 30 ms |
|Packet Loss |< 1% |

As noted, the quality of real-time media over an IP network is greatly affected by the quality of the network connectivity, but especially by the amount of:

- **Latency** - The time it takes to get an IP packet from point A to point B on the network. This network propagation delay is essentially tied to physical distance between the two points and the speed of light, including more overhead taken by the various routers in between. Latency is measured as Round-trip Time (RTT).
- **Inter-arrival jitter** - The average change in delay between successive packets.
- **Packet loss** - Packet loss is often defined as a percentage of packets that are lost in a given window of time. Packet loss directly affects audio qualityâ€”from small, individual lost packets that have almost no impact, to back-to-back burst losses that cause complete audio cut-out.

Expected data usage from Walkie Talkie is around 20 Kb/s when sending or receiving audio. When idle, expected data usage from Walkie Talkie is negligible.

Also, keep in mind the following:

- Walkie Talkie should work well in low bandwidth situations, or situations where the user's phone is connected and working. Walkie Talkie doesn't work when there's no connectivity at all.
- If users are using mobile data to communicate in Teams, Walkie Talkie will use the same method.

## Walkie Talkie devices

Frontline workers often need to speak and receive Walkie Talkie calls even when their phones are locked. This experience is possible through specialized devices with a dedicated PTT button.

> [!NOTE]
> These devices are not Teams certified. They have been validated to work with Teams Walkie Talkie.

## Bluetooth devices

> [!NOTE]
> If your users are using Bluetooth accessories, make sure that your mobile device management (MDM) solution doesn't block Bluetooth devices.

On devices running Android OS version 12 or later, Bluetooth permissions are required and location permissions to connect using the BLE stack are no longer required. If "nearby permissions" aren't granted at the Teams level, a user receives a prompt for Bluetooth permissions. This prompt is displayed, whether or not a Bluetooth accessory, such as a headset, is connected to their device. If a Bluetooth accessory is connected, tapping **Allow** connects Walkie Talkie to the Bluetooth accessory.

## Get insight into Walkie Talkie usage and performance

The [Walkie Talkie usage and performance report](teams-analytics-and-reports/walkie-talkie-usage-report.md) in the Teams admin center gives you and overview of Walkie Talkie activity and performance in your organization. The report provides information such as the number of PTT transmissions made and received, channel activity, transmission duration, and device and participant details.

## Data residency available

Walkie Talkie customer data for tenants in the European Union Data Boundary (EUDB) and in the United Kingdom is stored in data centers located in the EU. All other tenants have their Walkie Talkie customer data stored in data centers located in the United States. Tenants aren't provided with a choice for the specific deployment region for data storage.

### To be considered a tenant in the EUDB

The tenant must have a _default geography_ in a EUDB country/region or select a country/region in EUDB country/region as their residence during sign-up.

### How can I determine customer data location?

See [Azure Active Directory and data residency](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/data-residency).
