# Use Call Analytics to troubleshoot poor call quality

This article explains how to use Call Analytics to troubleshoot poor Microsoft Teams call or meeting quality for individual users if you hold the Teams Administrator, Teams communications support specialist, or Teams communications support engineer role.

## Call Analytics permissions

This article assumes that you've already set up Call Analytics. If you haven't, read [Set up call analytics for Teams](set-up-call-analytics.md).

## Introduction to Call Analytics

Call Analytics shows detailed information about Teams calls and meetings for each user in your Office 365 account. It includes information about devices, networks, connectivity, and call quality (any of these can be a factor in poor call or meeting quality). If you upload building, site, and tenant information, this information will also be shown for each call and meeting. Use Call Analytics to help you figure out why a user had a poor call or meeting experience.

Call Analytics shows you each leg of a call or meeting - for example, from one participant to a second participant. By analyzing these details, a Teams admin can isolate problem areas and identify the root cause for poor quality.

As the Teams admin, you get full access to all Call Analytics data for each user. In addition, you can assign Azure Active Directory roles to support staff. To learn more about these roles, read [Give permission to support and helpdesk staff](set-up-call-analytics.md#give-permission-to-support-and-helpdesk-staff). Don't miss [What does each Teams Support role do?](#what-does-each-teams-support-role-do) below.

## Where to find per-user Call Analytics

To see all call information and data for a user, go to the [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com). Under **Users**, select a user and then open the **Meetings & Calls** tab on the user's profile page. Here you'll find all calls and meetings that the user organized or participated in for the last 30 days.

To get additional information about a given session, including detailed media and networking statistics, click a session to see the details.

## What does each Teams Support role do?

The **Teams communications support specialist** (Tier 1 support) handles basic call-quality problems. They don't investigate issues with meetings. Instead, they collect related information and then escalate to a Teams communications support engineer.

The **Teams communications support engineer** (Tier 2 support) sees information in detailed call logs that are hidden from the Teams communications support specialist. The table below lists the information available to each Teams communication support role.

The following table tells you what per-user information is available for each communications support role. Please note that phone numbers are obfuscated for all roles and this behavior cannot be changed or disabled.

|Activity|Information|What the communications<br>support *specialist* sees|What the communications<br>support *engineer* sees|

|**Calls**|Caller name|Only the name of the user for whom the agent searched.|User name.|
||Recipient name|Shows as Internal User or External User.|Recipient name.|
||Caller phone number|Entire phone number except last four digits are obfuscated with asterisk symbols. For example, 1555282\*\*\*\*.|Entire phone number except last four digits are obfuscated with asterisk symbols. For example, 1555282\*\*\*\*.|

> [!NOTE]
> The information contained in both the Advanced tab's 'Other' section and the Debug tab contains telemetry and service diagnostic data meant to assist Microsoft support engineers. Without the context of the additional data available to support engineers, it may appear to be redundant, inaccurate, or confusing. While we make it available for advanced users who are looking for another level of detail in troubleshooting call issues, we don't recommend making judgments based on this data without Microsoft support.

## Troubleshoot user call quality problems

1. Open the Teams admin center (<https://admin.teams.microsoft.com>) and sign in with your Teams communications support or Teams Administrator credentials.

2. On the **Dashboard**, in **User Search**, start typing either the name or SIP address of the user whose calls you want to troubleshoot, or select **View users** to see a list of users.

3. Select the user from the list.

4. Select **Meetings & Calls**, and then select the call or meeting that you want to troubleshoot. This list will include calls and meetings that the user either organized or participated in.

5. Select the **Advanced** tab, and then look for yellow and red items which indicate poor call quality or connection problems.

   In the session details for each call or meeting, minor issues appear in yellow. If something is yellow, it's outside of normal range, and it may be contributing to the problem, but it's unlikely to be the main cause of the problem. If something is red, it's a significant problem, and it's likely the main cause of the poor call quality for this session.

In rare cases, Quality of Experience data isn't received for audio sessions. Often this is caused by a dropped call or when the connection with the client terminates. When this occurs, the session rating is **unavailable**.

For audio sessions that do have Quality of Experience (QoE) data, the following table describes major issues that qualify a session as **poor**.

|Issue|Area|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Call setup|Session|The error code Ms-diag 20-29 indicates the call setup failed. The user couldn't join the call or meeting.|
|Audio network classified poor call|Session|Network quality issues (such as packet loss, jitter, NMOS degradation, RTT, or concealed ratio) were encountered.|
|Device not functioning|Device|A device isn't functioning correctly. Device not functioning ratios are: <p> DeviceRenderNotFunctioningEventRatio >= 0.005 <br>  DeviceCaptureNotFunctioningEventRatio >= 0.005|
