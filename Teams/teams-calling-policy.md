Calling policies in Microsoft Teams
===================================

In Microsoft Teams, calling policies control which calling and call forwarding features are available to users. Calling policies determine whether a user can make private calls, use call forwarding or  simultaneous ringing to other users or external phone numbers, route calls to voicemail, send calls to Call Groups, use delegation for inbound and outbound calls, and so on. A default global policy is created automatically, but admins can also create and assign custom calling policies.

## Create a custom calling policy

Follow these steps to create a custom calling policy.

1. In the Microsoft Teams admin center, select **Voice** > **Calling policy**.
2. Select **New policy**.
3. Turn on the features that you want to use in your calling policy. All selections are **Off** by default.
4. To control whether users can route inbound calls to voicemail, select **Always enabled** or **User controlled**. To prevent routing to voicemail, select **Always disabled**.
5. Select **Save**.

## Modify an existing calling policy

Follow these steps to modify an existing calling policy.

1. In the Microsoft Teams admin center, select **Voice** > **Calling policy**.
2. Click next to the policy that you want to modify, and then select **Edit**.
3. Turn on the features that you want to use in your calling policy. All selections are **Off** by default.
4. To control whether users can route inbound calls to voicemail, select **Always enabled** or **User controlled**. To prevent routing to voicemail, select **Always disabled**.
5. Select **Save**.

## Assign a calling policy to a user

Follow these steps to assign a custom calling policy to a user.

1. In the Microsoft Teams admin center, select **Voice** > **Calling policy**.
2. Click next to the policy name to select it, and then select **Manage users**.
3. In the **Manage users** pane, search for the user’s name. (You must enter at least three characters.)
4. Select the user’s name, and then select **Add**.
5. Select **Save**.

## Calling policy settings

Use the following settings to create a custom calling policy.

### User can make private calls

This setting controls all calling capabilities in Teams. Turn this off to turn off all calling functionality in Teams.

### Call forwarding and simultaneous ringing to other users

This setting controls whether incoming calls can be forwarded to other users or can ring another person at the same time. 

### Call forwarding and simultaneous ringing to external phone numbers

This setting controls whether incoming calls can be forwarded to an external number or can ring an external number at the same time.

### Voicemail is available for routing inbound calls to users

This setting enables inbound calls to be sent to voicemail. Valid options are:

   - **Always enabled** Voicemail is always available for inbound calls. 
   - **Always disabled**  Voicemail is not available for inbound calls. 
   - **User controlled**. Users can determine whether they want voicemail to be available.

### Inbound calls can be routed to call groups 

> [!Include [feature preview](includes/preview-feature.md)]

This setting controls whether incoming calls can be forwarded to a call group.

### Allow delegation for inbound and outbound calls

> [!Include [feature preview](includes/preview-feature.md)]

This setting enables inbound calls to be routed to delegates, allowing delegates to make outbound calls on behalf of the users for whom they have delegated permissions. For more information, see [Share a phone line with a delegate](https://support.office.com/article/share-a-phone-line-with-a-delegate-16307929-a51f-43fc-8323-3b1bf115e5a8).


### Prevent toll bypass and send calls through the PSTN 

Setting this to **On** will send calls through the PSTN and incur charges rather than sending them through the network and bypassing the tolls.

### Busy on Busy is available while in a call

Busy on Busy (Busy Options)) is a new setting in Teams calling policies that lets you configure how incoming calls are handled when a user is already in a call or conference or has a call placed on hold. New or incoming calls can be rejected with a busy signal. You can enable busy options at the tenant level or at the user level. Regardless of how their busy options are configured, users in a call or conference or those with a call on hold are not prevented from initiating new calls or conferences. This setting is disabled by default.
