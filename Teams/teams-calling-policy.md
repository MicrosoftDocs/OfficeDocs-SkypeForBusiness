# Calling policies in Teams

In Microsoft Teams, calling policies control which calling and call forwarding features are available to users. Calling policies determine whether a user can make private calls, use call forwarding or simultaneous ringing to other users or external phone numbers, route calls to voicemail, send calls to call groups, use delegation for inbound and outbound calls, and so on.

You can use the global (Org-wide default) policy that's created automatically or create and assign custom policies.

## Create a custom calling policy

Follow these steps to create a custom calling policy.

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Voice** > **Calling policies**.
2. Select **Add**.
3. Turn on or turn off the features that you want to use in your calling policy.
    - For example, to control voicemail for inbound calls, select **On** or **Let users decide** to enable routing of calls to voicemail. To prevent routing to voicemail, select **Off**.
4. Select **Save**.

## Edit a calling policy

Follow these steps to edit an existing calling policy.

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, select **Voice** > **Calling policies**.
2. Select the policy or policies that you want to modify, and then select **Edit**.
3. Make the changes that you want, and then select **Save**.

## Assign a custom calling policy to users
