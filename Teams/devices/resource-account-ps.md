# Create a Microsoft 365 resource account using the PowerShell

Read this topic for information on how to create resource accounts for collaboration bars for Microsoft Teams using PowerShell.

The easiest way to create a resource account is by using the Microsoft 365 admin center. [See this article on how to do this](resource-account-ui.md).

[!INCLUDE [m365-teams-resource-account-difference](../includes/m365-teams-resource-account-difference.md)]

## Requirements

Before you deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms with Office 365, be sure you have met the requirements. For more information, see [Deploy collaboration bars for Microsoft Teams](collab-bar-deploy.md).

- If you need PSTN capabilities for the collaboration bar, you will need Phone System license.

- Your resource accounts must have Exchange mailboxes. As these are resource accounts, no Exchange license is required. We recommend the usage of the Meeting Rooms license for resource accounts.


### Add a resource account

1. Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell. For instructions, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online/exchange-online-powershell-v2/exchange-online-powershell-v2?view=exchange-ps#install-and-maintain-the-exchange-online-powershell-v2-module).

2. In Exchange Online PowerShell, create a new room mailbox or modify an existing room mailbox.

   - To create a new room mailbox, use the following syntax:

     ``` PowerShell
     New-Mailbox -Name "<Unique Name>" -Alias <Alias> -Room -EnableRoomMailboxAccount $true -MicrosoftOnlineServicesID <Account> -RoomMailboxPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String '<Password>' -AsPlainText -Force)
     ```

     This example creates a new room mailbox with the following settings:

     - Name: Huddle-Room-01

     - Alias: HuddleRoom01

     - Account: huddleroom01@contoso.onmicrosoft.com

     - Account password: P@$$W0rd242

     ``` PowerShell
     New-Mailbox -Name "Huddle-Room-01" -Alias HuddleRoom01 -Room -EnableRoomMailboxAccount $true -MicrosoftOnlineServicesID HuddleRoom01@contoso.onmicrosoft.com -RoomMailboxPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String 'P@$$W0rd242' -AsPlainText -Force)
     ```

   - To modify an existing room mailbox, use the following syntax:

     ``` PowerShell
     Set-Mailbox -Identity <RoomMailboxIdentity> -EnableRoomMailboxAccount $true -RoomMailboxPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String '<Password>' -AsPlainText -Force)
     ```

     This example enables the account for the existing room mailbox that has the alias value HuddleRoom02, and sets the password to 808P@$$W0rd. Note that the account will be HuddleRoom02@contoso.onmicrosoft.com because of the existing alias value.

     ``` PowerShell
     Set-Mailbox -Identity HuddleRoom02 -EnableRoomMailboxAccount $true -RoomMailboxPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String '808P@$$W0rd' -AsPlainText -Force)
     ```

   For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-Mailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/mailboxes/new-mailbox) and [Set-Mailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/mailboxes/set-mailbox).


3. In Exchange Online PowerShell, configure the following settings on the room mailbox to improve the meeting experience:

   - AutomateProcessing: AutoAccept (Meeting organizers receive the room reservation decision directly without human intervention: free = accept; busy = decline.)

   - AddOrganizerToSubject: $false (The meeting organizer is not added to the subject of the meeting request.)

   - DeleteComments: $false (Keep any text in the message body of incoming meeting requests.)

   - DeleteSubject: $false (Keep the subject of incoming meeting requests.)

   - RemovePrivateProperty: $false (Ensures the private flag that was sent by the meeting organizer in the original meeting request remains as specified.)

   - AddAdditionalResponse: $true (The text specified by the AdditionalResponse parameter is added to meeting requests.)

   - AdditionalResponse: "This room has a collaboration bar for Microsoft Teams!" (The additional text to add to the meeting request.)

   This example configures these settings on the room mailbox named Huddle-Room-01.

   ``` PowerShell
   Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity "Huddle-Room-01" -AutomateProcessing AutoAccept -AddOrganizerToSubject $false -DeleteComments $false -DeleteSubject $false -RemovePrivateProperty $false -AddAdditionalResponse $true -AdditionalResponse "This room has a collaboration bar for Microsoft Teams!"
   ```

   For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-CalendarProcessing](/powershell/module/exchange/mailboxes/set-calendarprocessing).

4. Connect to MS Online PowerShell to make Active Directory settings by running the `Connect-MsolService -Credential $cred` powershell cmdlet.   For details about Active Directory, see [Azure ActiveDirectory (MSOnline) 1.0](/powershell/azure/active-directory/overview?view=azureadps-1.0). 

   > [!NOTE]
   > [Azure Active Directory PowerShell 2.0](/powershell/azure/active-directory/overview?view=azureadps-2.0) is not supported. 

5. Set the password for huddleroom01@contoso.onmicrosoft.com to not expire using the following syntax:

      ``` Powershell
      Set-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName huddleroom01@contoso.onmicrosoft.com -PasswordNeverExpires $true
      ```
    
6. The resource account needs to have a valid Office 365 license, preferably the Meeting Room SKU. You also need to assign a usage location to your device accountâ€”this determines what license SKUs are available for your account. You can use `Get-MsolAccountSku` to retrieve a list of available SKUs for your Office 365 tenant.

      ``` Powershell
      Get-MsolAccountSku
      ```
    
    You can assign the license using Set-MsolUserLicense. 

      ``` Powershell
      Set-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName huddleroom01@contoso.onmicrosoft.com -UsageLocation "US"
      Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName huddleroom01@contoso.onmicrosoft.com -AddLicenses contoso:meeting_room
      ```
