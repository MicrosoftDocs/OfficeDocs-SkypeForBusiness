# Manage devices in Teams 

You can manage devices used with Microsoft Teams in your organization from the Microsoft Teams admin center. You can view and manage the device inventory for your organization and do tasks such as update, restart, and monitor diagnostics for devices. You can also create and assign configuration profiles to a device or groups of devices.

To manage devices, such as change device configuration, restart devices, manage updates, or view device and peripheral health, you need to be assigned one of the following Microsoft 365 admin roles:

- Microsoft 365 Global admin
- Teams Service admin
- Teams Device admin

For more information about admin roles in Teams, see [Use Teams administrator roles to manage Teams](../using-admin-roles.md).

## What devices can you manage?

You can manage any device that's certified for, and enrolled in, Teams. A device is automatically enrolled the first time a user signs in to Teams on the device. For a list of certified devices that can be managed, see:

- [Microsoft Teams Rooms](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/across-devices/devices/category?devicetype=20)
- [Conference phones](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/across-devices/devices/category?devicetype=73)
- [Desk phones](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/across-devices/devices/category?devicetype=34)
- [Teams displays](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/across-devices/devices/category?devicetype=34)
- [Teams panels](teams-panels.md)

To manage devices, in the left navigation of the [Microsoft Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com), go to **Teams Devices**, and then select the device type. Each type of device has its own respective section, which lets you manage them separately.

## Manage Teams Rooms on Windows devices

You can use the Teams admin center to view and remotely manage your Teams Rooms on Windows devices across your organization. The Teams admin center makes it easy to see, at a glance, which devices are healthy and which need attention, and lets you focus on specific devices to see detailed information about device health, meeting performance, call quality, and peripherals. 

Here are some things you can do to manage your Teams Rooms devices. Teams Rooms devices can be found in the [Microsoft Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com) under **Teams Devices** > **Teams Rooms on Windows**.

For details about how to manage your Teams Rooms devices, see [Manage Microsoft Teams Rooms](../rooms/rooms-manage.md).

## Manage phones, Teams Rooms on Android, Teams displays, and Teams panels 

In the Teams admin center, you can view and manage phones, Teams Rooms on Android, Teams displays, and Teams panels enrolled in Teams in your organization. Information that you'll see for each device includes device name, manufacturer, model, user, status, action, last seen, and history. You can customize the view to show the information that fits your needs.

Phones, Teams Rooms on Android, Teams displays, and Teams panels are automatically enrolled in Microsoft Intune if you've signed up for it. After a device is enrolled, device compliance is confirmed and conditional access policies are applied to the device.

Here are some examples of how you can manage phones, Teams Rooms on Android, Teams displays, and Teams panels in your organization.

If you're having trouble signing into an Android device, you can check the device's details page to see what sign-in failures might have occurred.

1. In the left navigation, go to **Teams devices** > select the Teams device type. For example, if the Android device is a phone, select **Phones**.
2. Click on the display name of the Phone that you want to view sign-in failures for. This will open the device's details page.
3. On the device details page, select the **Activity** tab and then select **Sign-in failure** in the **Activity type** drop-down.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't see any sign-in failures for a device you're having trouble signing into, make sure the device's firmware is on the latest version provided by its manufacturer.

The results that are returned contain the following information:

- The time the sign-in failure occurred.
- The account that attempted to sign into the device.
- The reason for the failure.

### Use configuration profiles in Teams

Use configuration profiles to manage settings and features for different Teams devices in your organization, including Teams Rooms on Android, Teams displays, Teams phone, and Teams panels. You can create or upload configuration profiles to include settings and features you want to enable or disable, and then assign a profile to a device or set of devices. 

#### Create a configuration profile

To create a configuration profile for a Teams device type:

1. In the left navigation, go to **Teams Devices** > select the Teams device type > **Configuration profiles**. For example, select **Teams Devices** > **Teams panels** > **Configuration profiles** to create a new configuration profile for Teams panels.
2. Click **Add**.
3. Enter a name for the profile and optionally add a friendly description.
4. Specify the settings you want for the profile, and then click **Save**.
   The newly created configuration profile is displayed in the list of profiles.

#### Assign a configuration profile

After creating a configuration profile for a Teams device type, assign it to one or more devices.

1. In the left navigation, go to **Teams Devices** > select the Teams device type. For example, to assign a configuration profile to a Teams panels device, select **Teams Devices** > **Teams panels**.
2. Select one or more devices, and then click **Assign configuration**.  
3. In the **Assign a configuration** pane, search for configuration profile to assign to the selected devices.
4. Click **Apply**.
   For the devices to which you applied the configuration policy, the **Action** column displays **Config Update** and the **Configuration profile** column displays the configuration profile name.
