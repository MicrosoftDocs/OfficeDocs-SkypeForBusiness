# Overview of Teams certified devices

Through the Microsoft Teams Device Certification Program, Microsoft tests personal and shared technological devices to ensure that they meet the highest standards of quality, reliability, and compatibility, and that users can have an optimized meeting experience when using Teams.

This program tests the devices based on a set of rigorous specifications, covering aspects such as audio and video quality, user interface, device management, and security. Only devices that successfully pass all certification requirements, and associated testing receive the designation of **Certified for Microsoft Teams**.
