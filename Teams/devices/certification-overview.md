# Microsoft Teams Device Certification Program overview

Through the Microsoft Teams Device Certification Program, Microsoft tests personal and shared technological devices to ensure that they meet the highest standards of quality, reliability, and compatibility, and that users can have an optimized meeting experience when using Teams.

This program tests the devices based on a set of rigorous specifications, covering aspects such as audio and video quality, user interface, device management, and security. Only devices that successfully pass all certification requirements, and associated testing receive the designation of **Certified for Microsoft Teams**.

You can connect effortlessly and collaborate at your best. Certified for Teams are designed to ensure that you are seen and heard at your best in every Teams meeting and call, wherever you are. Choose devices that are built for Microsoft Teams and, tested to offer a deeply immersive experience that makes it easy to collaborate, communicate, and connect with your team.

With more online meetings and calls than ever, trust our extensively validated devices to elevate the way you present yourself in every meeting and call whether you are in a conference room or at your desk.
