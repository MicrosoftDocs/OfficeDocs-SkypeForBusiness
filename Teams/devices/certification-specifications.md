# Certification specifications for Teams devices

## Resources

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with the V4 specification package, Microsoft is only releasing a subset of the specifications to the public. Specifications for user flow, Accessory Signaling Protocol, are subject to more frequent change as the Teams client app adds new features or refines existing ones, and are therefore only shared with direct device OEM partners.
