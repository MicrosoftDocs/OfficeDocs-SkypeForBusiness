The device store lets you browse and purchase devices certified for Microsoft Teams. There are two places where you can find the device store.

- Device store in Teams admin center

## Device store in Teams admin center

The device store in the Teams admin center lets you browse, purchase, and provision devices certified for Microsoft Teams. The device store is available in Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Austria, Spain, Greece, Belgium, Netherlands, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

To use the devices store in the Teams admin center, go to  **Devices > Store**.

### Requirements

To use the device store, you need to be a Global admin, a Teams admin, or a Teams device admin.

> [IMPORTANT]
>  Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. Using lower permissioned accounts helps improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to emergency scenarios when you can't use an existing role.

### Browse the store

The device store includes all devices that are certified for Teams, including headsets, web cameras, and Teams devices such as Teams Rooms, desk phones, and Teams displays. You can sort, filter, or search to find the device that your organization needs.

### Purchase devices

When you purchase devices from the device store, the payment and fulfillment, including shipping and delivery, are handled by UnifiedCommunications.com (a Microsoft third-party fulfillment partner), under their [terms of service](https://unifiedcommunications.com/docs/teams-marketplace/en-US/terms-of-service) and [privacy policy](https://unifiedcommunications.com/docs/teams-marketplace/en-US/privacy-policy).

You can pay with a credit card or a purchase order. Purchase order payment requires one-time setup with the fulfillment provider.

All orders can be returned up to 30 days after they're delivered.

### Order tracking and history

You can view the order history by going to **Store > Order history**, which includes all orders placed by you and other admins in the organization. Order history also includes the shipping status of your orders. For questions about order tracking, returns, or refunds, contact UnifiedCommunications.com. Their contact information is available on the invoice sent to the email address mentioned during order placement.

Orders placed in the Teams device store and any data associated with them are classified as tenant orders and tenant data.

### Provision devices

When you purchase devices that support remote provisioning, the MAC address of those devices is automatically added to the Teams admin center when the device is shipped. Depending on the order and when it ships, it can take approximately five days for the MAC address to appear in the Teams admin center.

Once your devices are delivered, see [Remotely provision devices](remote-provision-remote-login.md#generate-a-verification-code) to complete the provision and sign-in process.

> [!NOTE]
> For devices purchased from the store, the automatic addition of the device MAC address to the Teams admin center is supported in United States and Canada only. For information about manually adding a device using its MAC address, see [Add a device MAC address](remote-provision-remote-login.md#add-a-device-mac-address).

## Device store in Teams App

The device store is available for tenants in Canada and the United States. To use the device store in the Teams App, go to **Apps > Devices**.
