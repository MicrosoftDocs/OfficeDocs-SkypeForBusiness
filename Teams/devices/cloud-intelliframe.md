# Cloud IntelliFrame

Cloud IntelliFrame is a new experience that allows online meeting attendees to see people in Teams Rooms more clearly through the smart video feeds of in-room participants. These smart video feeds are created by zooming into the faces of the in-room participants and by eliminating distractions, thereby enhancing the hybrid meeting experience. You can see the expressions and gestures of the people in the room more easily, which helps improve collaboration in hybrid meetings. It creates equity in hybrid meetings as everyone can be seen and heard.

## Experience overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Install appropriate signage outside any meeting room where you enable Cloud IntelliFrame advising people about the feature.

All Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows with a Pro license equipped with cameras (specified in [Supported cameras](#supported-cameras)) automatically opt-in to Cloud IntelliFrame. Online participants on Microsoft Teams Desktop (Windows and Mac) will see the IntelliFrame video feed as a secondary option from rooms with these cameras.

Cloud IntelliFrame shows the smart feed when there are nine or less people in the room. It automatically switches between the standard room view and IntelliFrame view based on in-room activity. For example, if someone enters the meeting room, the view would automatically switch to standard room view until the individual settles down.

People in the room can disable IntelliFrame by using the in-meeting settings on the console. These settings turn off Cloud IntelliFrame and enable a switchback to standard view for the room. All online attendees would then see the standard view from the room.

People on Teams Desktop can also toggle IntelliFrame on/off by right-clicking on the room's video tile and selecting **Turn off IntelliFrame**. This option switches off the IntelliFrame view just on their Teams client.

### Data Retention

Cloud IntelliFrame runs on Azure and is fully compliant with M365 data processing with full separation between tenant boundaries. The infrastructure of Cloud IntelliFrame is no different from the infrastructure we use to record Teams Meetings.

 Cloud IntelliFrame does not store meeting data or any identifiable information. The only data we log is what is needed to improve the service (for example, how long did it take to switch from room view to gallery, how often does the view layout change during the meeting), and to understand how Cloud IntelliFrame was used (for example, are end-users enabling/disabling it?).

## Manage Cloud IntelliFrame

Cloud IntelliFrame is ideal for focus rooms and medium spaces. It may not be ideal for large spaces as people farthest from the camera may appear blurry after digital zoom. You may also want to switch off Cloud IntelliFrame in rooms with glass walls without any privacy filter.

To switch off Cloud IntelliFrame in a room, perform the following steps:

1. Create an XML configuration file by following the steps in [Create an XML configuration file](../rooms/xml-config-file.md).
1. Add the following element in the *SkypeSettings.xml* file.

   ```XML
   <EnableCloudIntelliframe>false</EnableCloudIntelliframe>
   ```

1. Restart the console for the configuration changes to take effect.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You are responsible for compliance with local laws and regulations when you enable Cloud IntelliFrame in a particular jurisdiction, including with respect to obligations around notice, consent, and data retention. These obligations may include installing appropriate signage outside any meeting room where you enable Cloud IntelliFrame advising people about the feature.
> Cloud IntelliFrame does not have the capacity to identify particular individuals, due to the uncertainty regarding the scope of “biometrics” in the State of Illinois law; therefore, Cloud IntelliFrame is not intended for use in Illinois.
