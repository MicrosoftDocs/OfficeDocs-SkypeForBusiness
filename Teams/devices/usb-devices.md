# Personal peripherals certified for Microsoft Teams

The personal peripherals certification program ensures peripherals (such as headsets, speakerphones, webcams, and monitors) offer rich audio or video quality. Certified devices work (plug & play) with no extra configuration required, and offer call control with Microsoft Teams. The products provide a great experience for end users and administrators.

To explore devices tested and certified for Microsoft Teams, head over to the [Teams store](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/across-devices/devices).

For more information about call control support with Teams, see [control calls using a headset in Teams](https://support.office.com/article/Control-calls-using-a-headset-in-Teams-65d6e104-444d-4013-b8c2-f11317dd69a8).

### Special usage designations

- **Native Bluetooth Certified Audio Peripherals**  Most Bluetooth headsets and speakerphones that are certified for Microsoft Teams are designed to be used with a USB dongle for connectivity to PCs and Mac hosts. Many users have been asking for the option to directly pair their device with the host, because they don't have enough USB ports, or they don't want to have to remember to bring the USB dongle with them when they work in different locations.

    Native Bluetooth-certified devices, including headsets and speakerphones, are supported on Windows PCs (macOS may be supported in the future). Devices are tested for audio performance, call control, and Teams button integration, both with and without the use of a USB dongle.

    The performance in native Bluetooth mode is impacted by the Bluetooth radio on the host PC, so we recommend installing the latest firmware updates for both devices and Bluetooth radio. A small portion of users may need to continue to use the USB dongle, such as when working in a high-density radio environment, if their PC Bluetooth is heavily used by multiple paired devices, or with certain PCs that have poor-performing Bluetooth radios.

- **Premium Microphone for Open Office** All headsets are tested to provide clear audio, but open office and other noisy environments pose a greater challenge. Headsets with this designation pick up the voice of the headset user but don't transmit the sound of their neighbors.
- **Meeting room size** Shared devices such as speakerphones and cameras have a supported usage distance. Recommended distances may be different depending on the manufacturer. To give customers clear guidance, all shared devices are tested at certification against well-defined rooms sizes and noise environments.

## End-user experience

### New Teams certification benefits

- Dedicated Teams button and LED indicator light.
- User notification of events and alerts from the Teams client (for example, meeting starting).

- Ability to activate the Teams client or respond to notification with a press of the button (for example, to join a meeting).
- Certification designed for extensibility (new device/client features to be delivered via firmware update).

### Core certification benefits

- Automatic selection of default audio device and prioritization if multiple audio peripherals are present.
- Devices automatically register with the Teams client and are ready to use.
- Audio devices (for example, headsets, and speakerphones) offer:
  - Basic call control across when used with a PC or a Mac device. Basic controls include answer/hang-up, mute/unmute, and volume control.
  - Wide-band audio with no echo, distortion, or excessive glitches. Echo cancellation is also supported across devices.
- Video devices meet requirements for noise, color, image detail, jitter, latency, frame rate, and field of view.

## Administrator Experience

- No provisioning required.
- All devices support firmware updates to allow new features and performance improvements.

If you're a manufacturer and want to join the certification program, see [How to Join](certification-join.md) for requirements and available programs.
