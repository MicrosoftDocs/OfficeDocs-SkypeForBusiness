# IP Phones certified for Microsoft Teams

The IP Phones certification program ensures that customers using certified desk phones and conference phones will experience high quality audio calls and meetings experience.

## Announcing Certified for Microsoft Teams

In addition to offering customers a range of Skype for Business certified IP phones, as part of the Teams IP phone certification program, we are announcing the availability of new IP phone hardware that will be certified for Microsoft Teams. This certification program ensures a higher quality bar with higher performance targets and audio quality metrics. Phone vendors are actively working to meet this higher bar and will be qualifying against the new requirements this calendar year. Some of our partners are also working to provide support for the Skype for Business service on the same hardware as the Teams IP phones. Benefits from the Teams certified IP phone include:

- Native Teams experience with hardware button integration and LED notifications
- Calendar integration and one-touch meeting join
- Deployed and managed via the Microsoft Device Management Solution with Intune integration
