# Authentication best practices for Teams Android devices

This article provides general guidance and best practices for deploying authentication policies for Teams phones and calling devices.

>[!NOTE]
>Conditional Access requires an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Premium subscription.

>[!NOTE]
>Policies for Android mobile devices may not apply to Teams Android devices.


## Personal and shared devices

Shared Teams devices, like meeting room devices or common area phones, can't use the same requirements for enrollment and compliance that are typically applied to personal devices. Applying personal device authentication requirements to shared devices will cause the following sign-in issues:

1.  **Devices are signed out due to password policies**

Accounts used on Teams devices have a password-expiration policy. Unlike users, the accounts used with shared devices don't have a designated user to update and restore them to a valid state when their passwords expire. If your organization requires passwords to expire and reset periodically, these accounts will stop functioning on Teams devices until a Teams administrator resets the password and signs back in.

2.  **Devices fail to sign in due to conditional access policies**

Shared devices can't comply to Azure AD Conditional Access policies for user accounts or personal devices. If shared devices are grouped with user accounts or personal devices for a Conditional Access policy, the sign-in will fail.

For example, if multi-factor authentication is required for accessing Teams, user intervention is required to complete the  authentication. Shared devices do not support multi-factor authentication. Similarly, if the account is configured to reauthenticate every X days, a shared device can't resolve the challenge without user intervention.

## Best practices for Teams shared device deployments

Microsoft recommends the following settings when deploying Teams devices in your organization.

### **Password policy**

Teams shared devices should use an [Exchange resource account](/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-resource-mailboxes). These accounts can either be synced from Active Directory or created directly in Azure AD. Any password expiration policies for users also apply to accounts used on Teams shared devices as well.

To avoid disruptions caused by password expiration polices, set the password expiration policy for shared devices to never expire.

Starting with Teams devices CY21 [Update #1](https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-s-new-in-microsoft-teams-devices-eabf4d81-acdd-4b23-afa1-9ee47bb7c5e2#ID0EBD=Desk_phones) (Teams version 1449/1.0.94.2021022403 for Teams phones) and [CY2021 Update #2](https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-s-new-in-microsoft-teams-devices-eabf4d81-acdd-4b23-afa1-9ee47bb7c5e2#ID0EBD=Teams_Rooms_on_Android) (Teams version 1449/1.0.96.2021051904 for Microsoft Teams Rooms on Android), tenant administrators can sign into Teams devices remotely. Don't share passwords with technicians to set up devices. As an admin, use remote sign-in to issue verification codes and then sign into these devices from the Teams admin center.

For more information, see [Remote provisioning and sign in for Teams Android devices](/MicrosoftTeams/devices/remote-provision-remote-login). 

### **Conditional Access policies**

Azure AD Conditional Access sets additional requirements that devices must meet in order to sign in. For Teams devices, review the following guidance to determine if you have authored the appropriate policies. For an overview of Conditional Access, see [What is Conditional Access](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview).

### Multi-factor authentication

Accounts for shared devices are linked to a room or physical space, rather than to a user account. Because shared devices don't support multi-factor authentication, exclude shared devices from any multi-factor authentication policies.

>[!TIP]
>Use either [named location](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/location-condition) or [require compliant device](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-compliant-device) to secure shared devices.

### Location-based access with named locations

If shared devices are provisioned in a well-defined location that can be identified with a range of IP addresses, you can configure Conditional Access using [named locations](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/location-condition) for these devices. This conditional will allow these devices to access your corporate resources only when they are within your network.

### Require compliant device

>[!NOTE]
>Device compliance requires an Intune license.

If you're enrolling shared devices into Intune, you can configure device compliance as a control in Conditional Access so that only compliant devices can access your corporate resources. Teams devices can be configured for Conditional Access policies based on device compliance. For more information, see [Conditional Access: Require compliant or hybrid Azure AD joined device](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-compliant-device).

To set compliance setting for your devices using Intune, see [Use compliance policies to set rules for devices you manage with Intune](/intune/protect/device-compliance-get-started).

>[!NOTE]
> Shared devices being used for hotdesking should be excluded from compliance policies. Compliance polices prevent the devices from enrolling into the hot-desk user account. Instead, use named locations to secure these devices.
> To increase security, you can also [require multi-factor authentication](/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-enable-azure-mfa) for hot-desking users in addition to the named-location policies.

### Sign-in frequency

In Conditional Access, you can [configure sign-in frequency](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-session-lifetime#user-sign-in-frequency) to require users to sign in again to access a resource after a specified time period. If sign-in frequency is enforced for room accounts, shared devices will sign out until they are signed in again by an admin. Microsoft recommends excluding shared devices from any sign-in frequency policies.

### Filters for devices

[Filters for devices](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-condition-filters-for-devices) is a feature in Conditional Access that allows you to configure more granular policies for devices based on device properties available in Azure AD. You can also use your own custom values by setting extension attributes 1-15 on the device object and then using those.

Use filters for devices to identify your common-area devices and enable policies in two key scenarios:

1.  Excluding shared devices from policies applied for personal devices. For example, requiring device compliance isn't enforced for shared devices used for hot-desking but is enforced for all other devices based on model number.

2.  Enforcing special policies on shared devices that should not be applied to personal devices. For example, requiring named locations as policy only for common-area devices based on an extension attribute you set for these devices (for example: “CommonAreaPhone”).

>[!NOTE] 
> Some attributes such as **model**, **manufacturer**, and **operatingSystemVersion** can only be set when devices are managed by Intune. If your devices are not managed by Intune, use extension attributes.
