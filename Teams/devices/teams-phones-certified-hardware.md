# Certified Teams phones

The Microsoft Teams devices Certification Program ensures devices meet a high standard, with higher performance targets and quality metrics across the entire Teams experience (audio, video, user interface). Microsoft and OEM partners are actively working together to ensure devices meet all certification requirements, including security, audio and video quality, Teams experience, and accessibility.

Certification programs are designed to ensure all certified devices run an Android version with the required feature set for Teams and Teams Admin Center. Certification end dates are based on the Android version running on the device when it enters into the certification program. Our OEM partners are working to extend the lifetime of the certification by upgrading the Android version and recertifying, or by releasing new models that are state-of-the-art.

Microsoft is committed to certifying devices on latest Android versions available for Teams devices as long as OEM partners and SoC manufacturers are able to meet all certification requirements in effect at the time device enters certification.

Microsoft and its Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) partners continually develop products to meet the needs of the market and elevate the Teams devices experience. During the product lifecycle, some products may receive an OS upgrade before their certification expires and will need to be re0certified, while others may not be recertified and will be discontinued by the OEM.

We recognize that device certification expiration can impact your business. Our OEM partners will detail their End-of-Life policies to assist and direct you towards adopting newer technologies. For the most current information on Teams certified devices referenced here, consult our OEM partners' websites.

Following a certification expiration, Microsoft is committed to supporting the latest version of the Teams devices applications on certified devices for a span of two (2) years after the certification period concludes. While Microsoft makes every effort to maintain support as described here, it retains the discretion to modify its support policy if necessary. Should any changes occur, these changes are communicated through the established customer facing communication channels.
