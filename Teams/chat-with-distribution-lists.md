# Chat with distribution lists (DLs)

Users can start a chat with distribution groups (distribution lists), mail-enabled security groups, and Microsoft 365 groups. Once the **Chat with groups** setting is enabled, users can search, select the group, and start chatting with the members of the group.

> [!NOTE]
> Users can only add members from distribution lists, Microsoft 365 groups, or mail-enabled security groups.
>
> Users can add up to 250 members to their recipient list.

As an admin, you can enable or disable **Chat with groups** setting in the Microsoft Teams admin center.

1. Enable your Teams client for the public preview. See [Microsoft Teams Public Preview.](public-preview-doc-updates.md)
2. Sign in to the [Microsoft Teams admin center.](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/)
3. In the left navigation pane, select **Messaging policies** and select **Global (Org-wide default)**.
4. Turn on the **Chat with groups** setting and then select **Save**.
