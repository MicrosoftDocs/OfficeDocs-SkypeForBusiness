# Perform your upgrade to Teams

The steps you take to perform your upgrade to Teams depends on your current deployment of Skype for Business:

1. Before beginning your upgrade, be sure you [conduct a user pilot](pilot-essentials.md).

2.  Next, based on your current environment, choose your upgrade path:  

    - **If you are upgrading from Skype for Business Online to Teams**, follow the steps in [Upgrade from Skype for Business Online to Teams](https://aka.ms/SkypeToTeams-UpgradeOnline).

    -  **If you are upgrading from a Skype for Business on-premises environment**, you'll need to perform some extra steps to set up connectivity between your on-premises and online environments before you move your users to Teams. For more information, see [Upgrade Skype for Business on-premises to Teams](upgrade-to-teams-execute-SkypeforBusinessHybridOnPrem.md).
