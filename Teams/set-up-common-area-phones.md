# Deploy common area phones for Microsoft Teams

A common area phone is typically placed in an area like a lobby or another area that is available to many people to make a call; for example, a reception area, lobby, or conference phone. Common area phones are signed in with accounts tied to a Common Area Phone license.

This article provides an overview of how to deploy and configure Teams phones as common area phones for shared spaces. For a more complete meeting room experience, including audio conferencing, consider purchasing the dedicated Meeting Room license with a meeting room device.

## Overview

The Common Area Phone license supports: 


| &nbsp;  |  Common Area Phone  |
|---------|---------|
|Skype for Business |   &#x2714; |
|Microsoft Teams |   &#x2714; |
|Phone System |    &#x2714; |
|Audio Conferencing |       &#x2718; &sup1;  |
|Microsoft Intune |    &#x2718; |
|Worldwide Availability |       &#x2718; &sup2;  |
|Channel Availability |    EA, EAS, CSP, GCC, EES, Web Direct  |
|      |         |

&sup1; Common Area Phones can join audio conferences via dial-in number provided by the meeting organizer

&sup2; Not available in sovereign clouds  

>[!NOTE]
> Accounts for common area phones from the Skype for Business Server can't be migrated to Microsoft Teams. Follow the steps in this article to recreate those accounts for Teams, and, if required, migrate your PTSN connectivity.

## Step 1 - Buy the licenses

First, you need to purchase a Common Area Phone (CAP) license and make sure that you have a certified phone. To search for and learn more about certified phones, go to [Microsoft Teams devices](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/across-devices?ms.url=officecomteamsdevices&rtc=1).

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Billing** > **Purchase services**. 

2. If the **View by category** section isn't already displayed, go to **Purchase from Microsoft**, and select **View products**. Then select **Collaboration and communication**.  

3. In the product list, find **Common Area Phone** and select **Details**.

4. Enter the number of licenses you need, and select **Buy**.

>[!NOTE]
>If you’re using Intune in your environment and have conditional access rules that require device compliance, you’ll need to assign an Azure Active Directory Premium Plan 1, and Intune license to the device account for the common area phone.
>
>Common area phones can be impacted by conditional access rules and other identity configurations, like Multi-Factor Authentication. See [Authentication best practices for Teams Android devices](devices/authentication-best-practices-for-android-devices.md) to learn more.

## Step 2 - Create a new user account and assign licenses

### Using the Microsoft 365 admin center

If you're deploying more than one common area phones at once, learn how to create accounts and assign licenses [using PowerShell](#using-powershell).

If you're deploying one device:

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Users** > **Active Users** > **Add a user**.

2. Enter a username like "Main" for the first name and "Reception" for the second name.

3. Enter a display name if it doesn't autogenerate one like "Main Reception."

4. Enter a username like "MainReception" or "Mainlobby."

5. Set the password for your common area phone manually to prevent. To do this, uncheck **Automatically create a password** and **require this user to change their password when they first sign in**.  

    >[!Important]
    > Setting a password manually for common area phones is highly recommended to prevent sign-in issues for your end users.

6. Select the usage location of the device and assign the Common Area Phone license to the account. If any other licenses are needed, like Callings Plans, assign them.

>[!NOTE]
> You don't need to add a Phone System license. It's included with the Common Area Phone license.
>
>If you aren't using Microsoft Phone System Direct Routing or Operator Connect, you may want to add Calling Plans licenses. For more information on licenses, see [Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](./teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md).

### Using PowerShell

Use PowerShell when you want to create and assign licenses for more than one user account at once. See [Create Microsoft 365 user accounts with PowerShell](/microsoft-365/enterprise/create-user-accounts-with-microsoft-365-powershell?view=o365-worldwide) and [Assign Microsoft 365 licenses to user accounts with PowerShell](/microsoft-365/enterprise/assign-licenses-to-user-accounts-with-microsoft-365-powershell?view=o365-worldwide) for more information.

## Step 3 - Set policies for common area phones

Use policies to control what features are available to users on common area phones.

>[!NOTE]
>After you assign a policy, sign out of the phone and sign back in. It may take up to an hour for a policy assignment to take effect.

### IP phone policies

Phones signed in with accounts that have been assigned a Common Area Phone license will display the common area user experience.

If you want to override a phone's default interface, consider creating an [IP phone policy](/powershell/module/skype/new-csteamsipphonepolicy?view=skype-ps). For example, if a common area phone is used in a public area, set an IP phone policy to restrict searching your organization's Global Address Book and block hot-desking. See 
[Set Teams Android devices user interface](devices/Teams-Android-devices-user-interface.md) to learn more.

### Calling policies

Use calling policies to enable private calls, using call forwarding, or simultaneous ring on common area phones. See [Calling and call-forwarding in Teams](teams-calling-policy.md) to learn more.

By default, call park isn't enabled for common area phones. You'll need to create a policy to enable it. See [Call park and retrieve in Microsoft Teams](call-park-and-retrieve.md) to learn more.

## Step 4 - Acquire and assign phone numbers

See [Manage telephone numbers for your organization](manage-phone-numbers-landing-page.md) to learn how to acquire and assign phone numbers based on your PSTN connectivity option.

## Step 5 - Sign in

Once you create and configure a user account, you can sign into a phone. Depending on how many phones you're deploying, you have three sign-in options:

- [Local sign-in](#local-sign-in)
- [Sign in from another device](#sign-in-from-another-device)
- [Sign in using the Teams admin center](#sign-in-using-the-teams-admin-center)

### Local sign-in

To sign in locally with a username and password: 

1. Turn on the common area phone

2. Select **Sign in on this device**

3. Follow the sign-in directions on the device. Once signed in, the phone will display the common area phone user experience.

### Sign in from another device

You can also sign into to a common area phone from another device using a code. When you sign in this way, you'll enter the username and password on another device, rather than on the phone itself.

1. First, on your common area phone, look for the code displayed on the sign-in screen.

2. On another device, go to https://www.microsoft.com/devicelogin.

3. Enter the code and following the instructions to complete the sign in.

### Sign in using the Teams admin center

As an admin, you can remotely provision and sign into common area phones from the Teams admin center. This is the most efficient sign-in method when you're deploying a large number of phones at once. See [Remote provisioning and sign in for Teams Android devices](devices/remote-provision-remote-login.md) to learn more.

## Next steps

Now that you've set up and signed in common area phones for your organization, you can manage them in the Teams admin center. See [Microsoft Teams: Managing your devices](devices/device-management.md) to learn more.
