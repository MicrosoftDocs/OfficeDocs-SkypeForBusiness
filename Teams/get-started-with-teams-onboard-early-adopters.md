# Onboard early adopters to Microsoft Teams

## Invite users to Teams

Send a welcome email to users with the names and descriptions of the teams you created and invite them to join the conversations in Teams. Be sure to include the following links in the email so they know where to get Teams clients, training, and support:
- [Teams web client](https://teams.microsoft.com)
- [Desktop and mobile client download links](https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads)
- [Teams training videos](https://support.office.com/article/microsoft-teams-video-training-4f108e54-240b-4351-8084-b1089f0d21d7)
- [Teams Help documentation](https://support.office.com/teams)

For example, for the "Get to know Teams" team, you might want to start your email like this:

   ```console
   Welcome to Microsoft Teams for <insert_company_name>. Teams is a chat-based workspace that brings together chat, files, people, and tools in one place. 

   We created a team called "Get to know Teams" to get you started. Use it to experiment, ask questions, and discover the possibilities of Teams. 

   To join, click <link to the team>.
   ```

Engage with users when they first join. Post a welcome message in Teams and start a chat in a channel. Doing this sets the tone and encourages users to make the switch to Teams. In the welcome message, include the same links you sent in email so users know where to get Teams as well as any other helpful information to get users up and running quickly. Touch base with users to ensure they know how to download, install, and sign in to Teams so they can start chatting, sharing files, and collaborating with each other.  

## Get Teams clients
Teams has clients for desktop (Windows and Mac), web, and mobile (iOS and Android). We recommend users install the desktop and mobile clients to have the best experience with Teams. 

Jump to: [Teams for Windows](#teams-for-windows) | [Teams for Mac](#teams-for-mac) | [Teams for web browsers](#web-client) | [Teams for iOS](#teams-for-ios) | [Teams for Android](#teams-for-android)

### Desktop client

The Teams desktop client gives Windows and Mac users the best overall experience. To learn more, see [Get clients for Teams (Desktop client)](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/get-clients#desktop-client) and [Hardware requirements for the Microsoft Teams app](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/hardware-requirements-for-the-teams-app).

> [!NOTE]
> As an admin, you can choose the method to distribute the installation files to computers in your organization, such as Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (Windows) or Jamf Pro (macOS).

#### Teams for Windows 
The easiest way to install the Windows desktop client is to:

1. Download the Windows desktop client from [https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads](https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads).
2. Run the installer (doesn't require admin permissions). 
3. Start Teams after installation completes.

> [!NOTE]
> Later, when you're considering a more formal, mass rollout of Teams across your organization, check out the [Teams Windows desktop client](https://aka.ms/teams-clients) video to learn how to plan for and deploy it. 

#### Teams for Mac 
The easiest way to install the Mac desktop client is to:

1. Download the Mac desktop client from [https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads](https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads).
2. Run the installer (requires admin permissions). 
3. Start Teams after installation completes.

### Web client
Teams provides a feature-rich web client, [https://teams.microsoft.com](https://teams.microsoft.com), that supports a variety of browsers.

[!INCLUDE [browser-support](includes/browser-support.md)]

### Mobile client

The Teams mobile clients for iOS and Android keep users connected and productive when on-the-go. To learn more, see [Get clients for Teams (Mobile clients)](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/get-clients#mobile-clients).

#### Teams for iOS 

Users running iOS 10.0 or later can download the Teams mobile app from the Apple App Store and get started right away.  

#### Teams for Android 
Users running Android 4.4 or later can download the Teams mobile app from the Google Play Store and get started right away.  

## Drive initial adoption

It's important to encourage your early adopters to actively use Teams to promote new collaboration experiences and develop Teams champions. We recommend using the "How do I" channel in the "Get to know Teams" team you created to share guidance with your users to help drive adoption. 

For detailed guidance on driving Teams adoption for your organization, see [Adopt Teams](adopt-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md).
