# Configure live event settings in Microsoft Teams
> [!INCLUDE [Preview customer token](../includes/preview-feature.md)]

Use Teams live events settings to configure settings for live events that are held in your organization. You can set up a support URL and configure a third-party video distribution provider. These settings apply to all live events that are created in your organization. 

You can easily manage these settings in the Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business admin center. In the left navigation, go to **Meetings** > **Live events settings**.

## Set up event support URL

This URL is shown to live event attendees. Add the support URL for your organization to give attendees a way to contact support during a live event.

### Using Windows PowerShell
Run the following:
```
Set-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastConfiguration -SupportURL “{your URL}” 
```
For more information, see [Set-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastConfiguration](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamsmeetingbroadcastconfiguration?view=skype-ps).
## Configure a third-party video distribution provider 

If you purchased and set up a software defined network (SDN) solution or enterprise content delivery network (eCDN) solution through a Microsoft video delivery partner, configure the provider for live events in Teams. 

### ![teams-logo-30x30.png](../media/teams-logo-30x30.png) Using the Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business admin center

1. In the left navigation, go to **Meetings** > **Live event settings**.
2. Under **Third-party video distribution providers**, complete the following: 

    ![Third-party video distribution provider settings in the Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business admin center](../media/teams-live-events-settings-distribution-provider.png "Screen shot of the third-party video distribution provider settings for live events")

    - **Use a third-party distribution provider** Turn this on to enable the third-party video distribution provider.
    - **SDN provider name** Choose the provider you're using.
    - **Provider license key** Enter the license ID that you got from your provider contact.
    - **SDN API template URL** Enter the API template URL that you got from your provider contact.

### Using Windows PowerShell
Get the license ID or API token and API template from your provider contact, and then run one of the following, depending on the provider you're using:

**Hive** 
```
Set-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastConfiguration -AllowSdnProviderForBroadcastMeeting $True -SdnProviderName hive -SdnLicenseId {license ID GUID provided by Hive} -SdnApiTemplateUrl “{API template URL provided by Hive}”
```
**Kollective** 
```
Set-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastConfiguration -AllowSdnProviderForBroadcastMeeting $True -SdnProviderName kollective -SdnApiTemplateUrl "{API template URL provided by Kollective}" -SdnApiToken {API token GUID provided by Kollective}
```
For more information, see [Set-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastConfiguration](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamsmeetingbroadcastconfiguration?view=skype-ps).

> [!NOTE]
> If you plan to create live events that use external encoders, you'll also need to [configure your eCDN provider with Microsoft Stream](https://docs.microsoft.com/stream/network-caching).
