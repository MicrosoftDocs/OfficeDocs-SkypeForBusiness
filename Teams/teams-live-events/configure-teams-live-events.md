# Configure live event settings in Microsoft Teams

> [!NOTE]
> We're currently still supporting live events. While we still recommend you to upgrade to [Teams town halls](../plan-town-halls.md) to take advantage of new features and experiences, your users can continue to schedule events. For more information, see [Updates for Town Hall in Microsoft Teams and Teams Live Events](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/extension-for-teams-live-events-retirement/ba-p/4148352).

Teams live events settings  allow you, as an admin, to manage settings for live events in your organization. You can set up a support URL and configure a third-party video distribution provider. These settings apply to all live events that are created in your organization.

## Add event support URL

The support URL for the event is shown to live event attendees. Add your organization's support URL so attendees can contact support during live events.

### Use the Microsoft Teams admin center to add an event support URL

1. Open the Teams admin center.
2. Expand **Meetings** from the navigation pane.
3. Under **Meetings**, select **Live event settings***.
4. Under **Support URL**, enter your organization's support URL.
5. Select **Save**

### Use PowerShell to add an event support URL

In PowerShell, the **`-SupportURL`** parameter in the **CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastConfiguration** cmdlet allows you to add a support URL for live events.

To add a support URL, use the following script:

```PowerShell
Set-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastConfiguration -SupportURL “{your URL}”
```

## Configure a third-party video distribution provider

For information about setting up a software defined network (SDN) solution or enterprise content delivery network (eCDN) solution, see [Enterprise content delivery networks for streaming Microsoft Teams events](/microsoftteams/streaming-ecdn-enterprise-content-delivery-network).
