# Live event recording policies in Microsoft Teams

You have several options for recording a Microsoft Teams live event. The recording options are set using recording policies. This article describes the various settings.

The recording options are set using the PowerShell command [Set-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamsmeetingbroadcastpolicy).

## Scheduling and option behaviors

There are two organizer options while scheduling a live event recording:

- Recording available for producers and presenters

  - Recording file: Provides a recording file that producers and presenters can download after the event is over.

- Recording available for attendees

  - DVR: A digital video recorder (DVR) allows attendees to rewind and pause during the event

  - VOD: A video on demand (VOD) allows attendees to watch after the event is over

## Broadcast recording policy setting

As part of the broadcast policy, there's a setting that you can toggle to turn recording on or off for a live event.
