# Use PowerShell to set live events policies in Microsoft Teams
> [!INCLUDE [Preview customer token](../includes/preview-feature.md)]

You can use the following Windows PowerShell cmdlets to set and assign policy settings for live events in Teams: 
- [Get-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/get-csteamsmeetingbroadcastpolicy?view=skype-ps)
- [Set-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamsmeetingbroadcastpolicy?view=skype-ps)
- [New-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/get-csteamsmeetingbroadcastpolicy?view=skype-ps)
- [Grant-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/grant-csteamsmeetingbroadcastpolicy?view=skype-ps)

Here's some examples.

## Allow users to schedule live events 

> [!NOTE]
> These examples are for quick start events. For external encoder events, there are additional steps you must do. For more information, see [Enable users to schedule external encoder events](set-up-for-teams-live-events.md#enable-users-to-schedule-external-encoder-events).

**Allow a user to schedule live events**

If the user is assigned the global policy, run and verify that *AllowBroadcastScheduling* parameter is set to *True*:
```
Get-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy -identity Global
```
Then assign the user to the global policy, run:
```
Grant-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy -Identity {user} -PolicyName $null -Verbose
```

### User scenarios
**You want all users in your organization to be able to schedule live events**

If users are assigned the global policy, run and verify that *AllowBroadcastScheduling* *is set to *True*:
```
Get-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy -identity Global
```
If users are assigned a policy other than the global policy, run and verify that *-AllowBroadcastScheduling* is set to *True*:
```
Get-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy -identity {policy name}
```
**You want live events scheduling to be disabled across your organization**

Disable live events scheduling, run:
```
Set-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy -identity Global -AllowBroadcastScheduling $false
```
Assign all users in your organization to the global policy, run:
```
Grant-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy -Identity {user} -PolicyName $null -Verbose
```

**You want a large number of users to be able to schedule live events and prevent a set of users from scheduling them**

Run and verify that *AllowBroadcastScheduling* is set to *True*:
```
Get-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy -Identity Global
```
Then assign a user or users to the global policy, run:
```
Grant-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy -Identity {user} -PolicyName $null -Verbose
```

Create a new policy that doesn't allow scheduling live events, run:
```
New-CSTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy -Identity DisabledBroadcastSchedulingPolicy
```
Disable live events scheduling, run:
```
Set-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy -Identity DisabledBroadcastSchedulingPolicy -AllowBroadcastScheduling $false
```
Then assign users to this policy, run:
```
Grant-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy -Identity {user} -PolicyName DisabledBroadcastSchedulingPolicy -Verbose
```
**You want to disable live event scheduling for a large number of the users and allow a set of users to schedule them**

Disable live events scheduling, run:
```
Set-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy -identity Global -AllowBroadcastScheduling $false
```
Then assign those users to the global policy, run:
```
Grant-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy -Identity {user} -PolicyName $null -Verbose
```
Create a policy to allow live events scheduling, run:
```
New-CSTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy -identity EnableBroadcastSchedulingpolicy
```
Enable live events scheduling, run:
```
Set-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy -identity EnableBroadcastSchedulingpolicy -AllowBroadcastScheduling $true
```
Then assign users to this policy, run:
```
Grant-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy -Identity {user} -PolicyName EnableBroadcastSchedulingpolicy -Verbose
```
## Set who can join live events
 
Set the global policy to allow users to create events that everyone, including anonymous users, can attend, run:
```
Set-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy -Identity Global -BroadcastAttendeeVisibility Everyone  
```
## Set the recording option for live events
> [!NOTE]
> This setting applies only to quick start events.

Set the global policy to disable recording for live events:
```
Set-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy -Identity Global -BroadcastRecordingMode AlwaysDisabled 
```
## Set transcription and translation in live events (coming soon)
> [!NOTE]
> This setting applies only to quick start events. 

Set the global policy to turn on transcription and translation on for event attendees:
```
Set-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy -Identity Global -AllowBroadcastTranscription $true 
```
