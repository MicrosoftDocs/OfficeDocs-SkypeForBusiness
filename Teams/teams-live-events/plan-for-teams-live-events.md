# Plan for live events in Microsoft Teams
> [!INCLUDE [Preview customer token](../includes/preview-feature.md)]

When you are planning Teams live events to hold large meetings in your organization, there are several factors that you need to consider before starting to set it all up. 

## Who can create and schedule live events? 
The following prerequisites are required for the user to schedule a Teams live event.

Here are the licenses that must be assigned:  
- An Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, or E5 license or an Office 365 A3 or A5 license. 
- A Microsoft Teams, Skype for Business, and Microsoft Stream license.

It's important to know that an Office 365 license is required to participate in a live event as an authenticated user but this depends on the production method used:

- **For Quick start production**  The user must be assigned a Microsoft Teams license.
- **For External encoder production** The user must be assigned a Microsoft Stream license.

For more information on licensing, see [Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](/SkypeForBusiness/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing).

The user must have:
- Private meeting scheduling in Teams enabled (*The TeamsMeetingPolicy -AllowPrivateMeetingScheduling parameter = True*).
- Live event scheduling in Teams enabled (*The TeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy -AllowBroadcastScheduling parameter = True*).
- Permissions to create live events in Microsoft Stream (for [external encoder production](#production)).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Office 365 guests, federated, and anonymous users can't be invited as producers or presenters in Teams live events. Office 365 guest and federated users can only watch live events anonymously.

## Regional availability
You can use Teams live events in multiple regions across the world. The following information shows availability for event team members and attendees. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The region for the event is automatically selected depending on the organizer and the Office 365 organization.

**Available in these regions**
- Americas
- Europe/Africa
- Asia Pacific
- Go Local Canada

**Exclusions and considerations**
- **Go Locals:** United Kingdom, India, and other Microsoft Teams Go Locals are not currently supported.
- **China:** Event team members and attendees will not be able to use Teams live events because Azure CDN is not accessible in China. A workaround is to use a company VPN connection, which gets the client connected to CDN via the customer's corporate network.
