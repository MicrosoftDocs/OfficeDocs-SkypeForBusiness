# Adobe Acrobat as a default PDF viewer in Microsoft Teams

> [!NOTE]
> Adobe Acrobat as a default PDF experience in Microsoft Teams is currently available only in public preview. To use this functionality, admins must [enable public preview](public-preview-doc-updates.md#enable-public-preview) for their tenant and ensure that the end-users change Teams client version to public preview.

As an admin, you can set Adobe Acrobat as the default app to view and edit PDF files in Microsoft Teams. Your end-users can view, search, comment and annotate PDF files without an Adobe Acrobat subscription or an Adobe ID.

To configure Adobe Acrobat app as the default handler for PDF files in your tenant, complete the following steps as prerequisites:

* [Allow Adobe Acrobat app](#allow-adobe-acrobat-app-in-your-tenant).
* [Install Adobe Acrobat app](#install-adobe-acrobat-app-for-all-users).

## Allow Adobe Acrobat app in your tenant

Before you set up the app, ensure that you allow apps to be used in your tenant, that you've specifically allowed Adobe Acrobat app, and the app permission policies allow it. To set up Adobe Acrobat as the default app for PDF files, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to Teams admin center and access **Teams app** > **[Manage apps](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps)**.

1. Search for the Adobe Acrobat app and select it. It opens the app details page.

1. Select the **Permissions** tab and then select **Review permission**.

1. Select **Accept**.

## Install Adobe Acrobat app for all users

To assign and make the Adobe Acrobat app available for all users, follow these steps:

1. In Teams admin center, go to **Teams app** > [**Setup policies**](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/app-setup).

1. Under **Manage policies** tab, select **Global (Org-wide default)**, and then select **Edit**.

1. Under Installed apps, select **Add apps**.

1. Search **Adobe Acrobat**, select **Add** next to the app name and then select **Add**.

1. Select **Save**.

After you select save, Teams uses Adobe Acrobat app as the default file handler for PDF files.

If you want to selectively allow the Adobe Acrobat app for a few individuals or for a group, you can assign a [custom app permission policy](teams-app-permission-policies.md).

Know the following information about this functionality:

* After the policy is set up, it typically takes a [few hours](teams-app-setup-policies.md) for the app to be available for users.
* Viewing of PDF files that are pinned in channels as a tab and viewing of PDF files in Assignments app continues to be powered by the native Teams experience.
* Adobe Acrobat as a default PDF viewer in Teams works only on desktop and web clients. It isn't supported on mobile client.
* Users need an Adobe Acrobat plan to use the premium tools such as Export PDF, Organize Pages, Combine Files, Compress PDF, and Protect PDF.
* To uninstall the app, end-users can remove the app from the Teams client. Admin can remove the Adobe Acrobat app by using setup policy.
* If you block Adobe Acrobat app, then remove it from the setup policy. It ensures that the end-user experience reverts to using the native PDF file viewer.
* From Teams desktop client, if you face any issues while signing in to Adobe Acrobat app, use Teams in browser to sign in.
