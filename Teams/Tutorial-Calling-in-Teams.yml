- title: What is calling in Teams?
  durationInMinutes: 15
  content: |
    Out of the box, Teams supports the ability for users to make voice over IP (VoIP) calls from Teams client to Teams client.

    In Teams, there are two options to enable users to make, receive, and transfer calls to and from landlines and mobile phones on the public switched telephone network (PSTN):
    - With Phone System with Calling Plans Microsoft provides the phone number to your users and all PSTN services
    - With Direct Connect you can connect your existing PSTN connectivity via an SBC (Session Boarder Controller) to Microsoft Teams.

    ### Calling features in Teams
    Calling in Teams supports basic Phone System features, such as call answering and initiating (by name and number) with integrated dial pad, call holding and retrieving, call forwarding and simultaneous ringing, call history, voicemail, and emergency calling.

    More advanced features will be added over time. For more information, see [Microsoft 365 Roadmap](https://aka.ms/O365Roadmap).

    Calling in Teams is powered by Phone System (formerly known as Cloud PBX), the same service in Office 365 that enables PSTN calling capabilities in Skype for Business Online.

    <span style="color:red">**Important**:</span> Note that the Phone System feature set for Skype for Business is different from the Phone System feature set for Teams.

    <span style="color:red">**Action**:</span> To understand which features are currently available and the timelines for features that we expect to develop, see the following resources:

    - On the [public roadmap](https://aka.ms/O365Roadmap), review the “Calling
    roadmap” slide for an overview of the expected timelines for feature release dates.
    - Review [Here’s what you get with Phone System in Office
    365](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/here-s-what-you-get-with-phone-system)
    for a description of Phone System features. Keep in mind that at this writing, some
    of these features might only be available for Skype for Business.

    ### Emergency Services calling
    It’s important that you understand how the Emergency Services calling feature operates differently in Teams than in traditional telephone services. You must make sure your users also understand those differences. For example, when they use Teams to call emergency services (such as 911 in the United States), users need to be aware that Teams might not be able to determine the actual location of the caller.

    <span style="color:red">**Action**:</span> Review [Emergency calling terms and conditions](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/legal-and-regulatory/emergency-calling-terms-and-conditions) for detailed information about Emergency Services calling.

- title: Considerations for Skype for Business Online customers
  durationInMinutes: 2
  content: |
    If you aren’t using Skype for Business Online, you can skip this section. For
    those who are familiar with the calling feature in Skype for Business Online, we
    want to highlight some important points.

    - **Calling Plans or Direct Routing to connect to the PSTN.**
    The options to connect Teams to the PSTN are a little bit different than in
    Skype for Business Online: While Calling Plans (formerly known as Cloud PBX
    with PSTN Connectivity), exist for both, the option for connecting your
    existing PBX or SIP Trunk to Teams is called "Direct Routing".
    Detailed documentation on Direct Routing can be found here: [Phone System Direct Routing](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/direct-routing-plan)

    - **Features are different between Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams.**
    Note that the calling features in Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams are
    different. Don’t assume that just because one of the clients is capable of
    something, the other client can do it as well.

    - **Calls can be received either in Teams or Skype for Business, but not both.**
    If you configure your users for Phone System with Calling Plans, they can
    initiate calls from either Teams or Skype for Business. However, they can
    only receive calls on one of the applications—to configure which application
    receives calls, you use a new policy, CsTeamsInteropPolicy. You’ll learn
    more about the policy later in this training.

    - **Calls can be made either from Skype for Business or Teams, if you’ve
    configured Phone System in Teams.**
    Except for the aforementioned configuration of the CsTeamsInteropPolicy, the
    configuration is the same in Skype for Business and Teams. This means that
    if you’ve already configured calling for Skype for Business, your users will
    be able to place calls from Teams.

- title: Practical guidance
  durationInMinutes: 3
  content: |
    Microsoft provides practical guidance that takes you through the Office 365
    FastTrack customer journey framework and its three phases—Envision, Onboard, and
    Drive Value—to help you plan, deliver, and operate a successful Phone System
    with Calling Plans implementation.

    The goal of the practical guidance is to set your project up for success, not
    only from a technical perspective (that is, delivering a reliable, high-quality
    implementation) but also making sure that the solution meets the requirements of
    the project stakeholders.

    There’s a feedback loop between practical guidance and technical planning:

    - You need to understand the features and capabilities of Phone System to
    understand how it can support your business use cases.

    - You need to define your business use cases to understand how to best
    configure Phone Systems.

    This means you might have to adjust this practical guidance to meet your
    objectives. You’ll be asked to complete the following tasks:

    - Define business use cases for Phone System with Calling Plans Document expected, measurable business outcomes, including the following:

      - Description of your current business process

      - Challenges with your existing business process

      - How technology can help overcome these challenges

      - The expected, measurable business outcomes if these challenges are
      overcome

    - Identify key stakeholders
    Based on your business use cases, create a comprehensive list of
    stakeholders, including roles and descriptions. This helps you identify
    everyone involved in the project.

    - Define objectives and key results (OKRs), key success indicators (KSIs), and
    risks
    Use OKRs and KSIs to set clear goals for measuring the success of the
    project, and review them regularly to measure progress. It’s important that
    the stakeholders are aware of and agree to the OKRs and KSIs to work toward
    a common goal. In addition, you need to identify and document risks to raise
    awareness, and be prepared to mitigate them as needed.

    - Assess your environment and evaluate adoption readiness
    After you know what you want to achieve and have documented your OKRs and
    KSIs, assess whether your organization is ready to leverage the service and
    whether it can provide all the features your users need.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Assessing the environment also includes conducting a readiness assessment
    for your network. Don’t underestimate the importance of networking: network
    quality directly affects the user experience. Even if you’ve never had problems
    with your network, real-time communication might behave differently from other
    applications. Especially when it comes to telephony, users have high
    expectations for great quality. Having network quality challenges—especially in
    the beginning of a project like this—might put the whole project at risk.

    - Map operational roles
    After the solution is rolled out, you’ll need someone to monitor and drive
    usage and quality. Mapping operational roles upfront helps you to identify
    the people you’ll need.

    - Create a success plan
    The success plan gives the project team—which can include FastTrack or a
    deployment partner—enough information to realize the organization’s goals
    with Phone System with Calling Plans. It should contain the following
    sections:

      - Business case

      - Service readiness

      - Adoption plan

      - Operational plan

    **Additional information:** For more details about this practical guidance and templates you can use in your
    planning, see [Phone System with Calling Plans](calling-plan-landing-page.md).

- title: Envision
  durationInMinutes: 15
  content: |

    To plan for the implementation of calling in Teams, a series of decisions must
    be made to better prepare your organization to meet business requirements. These
    include:

    -   Connecting to the PSTN

    -   Service availability and user locations

    -   Phone System licensing

    -   Phone numbers and emergency locations

    -   Voicemail

    -   Optional: Calling identity

    -   Optional: Dial plans

    ### Connecting to the PSTN

    In order for users to place and receive calls to the PSTN by using Teams, you
    need to have installed Phone System and you need to connect phone system to the
    PSTN.

    > **Example** <br/> To better understand how Phone System and the connection to the PSTN
    work together, imagine you’re buying a mobile phone. The phone has nice features
    (such as buttons and apps), but to make calls you’ll need to have a call plan
    with a phone provider, who gives you an actual phone number and provides
    connectivity to the PSTN.

    Phone System is the equivalent of the mobile phone: it provides you with
    functionality such as voicemail, but neither gives you a phone number nor lets
    you place or receive phone calls to or from the PSTN. For connecting Phone
    System to the PSTN—the equivalent of a contract with a phone provider—Microsoft
    offers Calling Plans, in which Microsoft provides each user a phone number that
    can place and receive calls.

    Currently, Calling Plans are the only way to connect Phone System to the PSTN.
    In the future, you’ll have the option to connect any existing telephone
    environment that you have on-premises to Teams.

    ### Service availability and user locations

    Phone System is available where Office 365 is available (for the complete list
    of countries and regions, see [International
    availability](https://products.office.com/business/international-availability)).
    The availability of the Calling Plans service is a little more restricted. The
    commercial availability of Phone System and Calling Plans also depends on where
    your organization is based—and, more importantly, in which country or region
    your organization has a commercial relationship with Microsoft and its partners:

    -   Calling Plans can be assigned and used only for users located in countries
    where calling plans are available.

    -   Calling Plans can only be purchased if your billing address is located in a
    country or region where Audio Conferencing can be purchased.

    > **Example 1** <br/>Contoso’s billing address is in Austria, and the company wants to use
    Phone System with Calling Plans for their users in Germany. Although the Calling
    Plans are available in Germany, they aren’t available in Austria. However, Audio
    Conferencing can be purchased in Austria, so Contoso can buy the required
    licenses for their users in Germany.

    > **Example 2** <br/>Fabrikam, Inc. is a company based out of Hong Kong, with some users
    in the United States. Their billing address is in Hong Kong. Although Microsoft
    can provide a phone number for Audio Conferencing in Hong Kong, Audio
    Conferencing isn’t available for purchase in that region. Unfortunately, this
    means that Fabrikam won’t be able to acquire Calling Plans for their US-based
    users.

    <span style="color:red">**Action**:</span> Review [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and
    Calling
    Plans](https://docs.microsoft.com/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans)
    for the following information:

    -   For the country where your billing address is located, check whether Audio
    Conferencing is available for purchase. This will determine whether you can
    buy any Calling Plans at all.

    -   For every country or region where you want users to leverage Calling Plans,
    check “Is Phone System available for purchase?” to learn whether Calling
    Plans are available in that country or region.

    ### Phone System licensing

    A Phone System license is available as part of Office 365 E5 subscription plans,
    or as an add-on service to Office 365 E1 or Office 365 E3 subscription plans.

    Calling Plans is an add-in to the Phone System feature in Office 365. This means
    that a Phone System license is the prerequisite for users to be enabled for
    Calling Plans.

    In general, there are two types of Calling Plan add-ins:

    -   Domestic Calling Plan

    -   International and Domestic Calling Plan

    Each Calling Plan type provides an allocation for calling minutes that users can
    use per month, either to make domestic calls or international calls. The number
    of minutes varies by country. After their allocation is exhausted, users won’t
    be able to make outbound calls—except for Emergency Services calling—until the
    next month’s billing cycle.

    As you might expect, a Domestic Calling Plan costs less than the International
    and Domestic Calling Plan. Typically, not everyone in an organization needs to
    make international calls. You can assign individual users to different calling
    plans based on the user’s business requirements. This flexibility can help you
    control the costs of your Phone System with Calling Plans implementation.

    You can set up Communications Credits so that users can make calls even after
    they’ve used up their minutes, without their having to wait until the next
    month’s billing cycle. This means that as soon as your allocation is exhausted,
    you can pay based on your consumption. You can also use Communications Credits
    to let users who have been assigned to a Domestic Calling Plan make
    international calls, which are then charged by using a “pay-per-minute” model.

    <span style="color:red">**Action**:</span>

    -   Review the Calling Plans section in [Country and region availability for
    Audio Conferencing and Calling
    Plans](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans)
    to understand the calling minutes allocation for each Calling Plan add-in
    type.

    -   Learn more about Communications Credits from [What are Communications
    Credits](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/what-are-communications-credits)?

    ### Phone numbers and emergency locations

    For Phone System with Calling Plans implementation, every user in your
    organization needs to have a unique subscriber (user) phone number. Subscriber
    (user) phone numbers can be obtained directly from Microsoft, or existing phone
    numbers can be transferred (ported) to Microsoft.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The complexity of obtaining or transferring phone numbers varies
    greatly depending on country/region, carrier, number of circuits involved, and
    many other contributing factors.

    In addition to ensuring that every user has a unique phone number, you must
    assign an emergency address to each phone number—either when you assign the
    phone number or when you first acquire it, depending on your country/region. The
    emergency address is required to support emergency services calling. It must be
    validated to ensure the address is recognized and it’s in the correct format for
    emergency response services to use.

    To give emergency responders more exact information about the location of your
    users, you can define emergency locations and associate them with validated
    emergency addresses. An emergency location is typically a building number,
    floor, building wing, or office number where the user is located.

    **Additional information**

    -   Review [Different kinds of phone numbers used for Calling
    Plans](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/different-kinds-of-phone-numbers-used-for-calling-plans)
    to understand about the types of phone numbers supported by Phone System in
    Office 365.

    -   Review [Manage phone numbers for your
    organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization)
    to learn more about obtaining user numbers for Calling Plans implementation.

    -   To learn more about transferring (porting) phone numbers to Microsoft, see
    [Transfer phone numbers to Office
    365](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/transfer-phone-numbers-to-office-365).

    -   To learn more about emergency address and locations, review [What are
    emergency locations, addresses and call
    routing?](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/what-are-emergency-locations-addresses-and-call-routing)

    -   [Emergency calling terms and
    conditions](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/emergency-calling-terms-and-conditions)

    ### Voicemail

    Cloud Voicemail, powered by Azure Voicemail services, supports voicemail
    deposits to Exchange mailbox only and doesn’t support third-party email systems.

    By default, Cloud Voicemail works with Exchange Online; however, it has a
    minimum [supported Exchange on-premises version and deployment
    model](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3195158/customer-issues-between-exum-and-azure-voicemail)
    to allow delivery of voicemail messages to user mailboxes in the on-premises
    Exchange deployment.

    Cloud Voicemail includes voicemail transcription, which is enabled for
    all users in your organization by default. Your business might require that you
    disable voicemail transcription for specific users or everyone throughout the
    organization.

    > [!NOTE]
    > A fallback mechanism has been implemented so that Cloud Voicemail can
    resend messages by using SMTP, which means users who have a mailbox on a
    third-party email system will receive their voicemail messages. This mechanism
    doesn’t include guaranteed service uptime or other voicemail features such as
    changing voicemail greetings.

    **Additional information**

    -   Review [Azure PBX voicemail support for Exchange
    Server](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3195158/customer-issues-between-exum-and-azure-voicemail)
    to understand how to enable on-premises Exchange to support Phone System
    voicemail.

    ### Optional: Calling identity

    By default, all outbound calls use the assigned phone number for the calling
    identity (Caller ID). The recipient of the call can quickly identify the caller
    and decide whether to accept or reject the call.

    In some cases, there are legitimate business reasons to display a different
    number to mask the identity of a caller.

    > **Example** <br/>Contoso is using Phone System with Calling Plans for their users.
    However, their business requirement demands that if the receptionist calls a
    phone number, the caller ID shouldn’t represent the phone number of the
    receptionist but rather the main phone number of the office.

    Other options are the possibility to block (anonymize) Caller ID presentation
    altogether, or give users the choice of using their caller ID or calling out
    anonymously.

    Caller ID can also be blocked for incoming calls.

    **Additional information**

    -   Learn more about calling identity controls from [How can caller ID be used
    in your
    organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/how-can-caller-id-be-used-in-your-organization).

    ### Optional: Dial Plans

    A Dial Plan in the Phone System feature of Office 365 controls how users dial
    phone numbers on the dial pad. The PSTN expects phone numbers in a specific
    format that starts with a plus sign (+) followed by digits that represent an
    E.164 number. E.164—the standard for PSTN numbers—specifies country codes.

    Obviously, users prefer not to use that long format when dialing phone numbers.
    Especially when they’re calling a local number, they want to proceed without a
    country code and maybe even without an area code. This is where dial plans come
    in: you can use them to normalize a user-entered phone number to the required
    format.

    > **Example 1** <br/>Alice wants to call the phone number +1 311-555-2368. Because Alice is
    in the United States, based out of Seattle (area code 206), she only needs to
    dial **311-555-2368**. Teams will normalize this phone number to the full number
    +1 311-555-2368 before routing it to the PSTN.

    By default, a generalized dialing behavior is implemented by the automatically
    assigned Dial Plan (also known as a *service dial plan*) based on each
    individual user’s license usage location. This generalized dialing behavior
    might not meet user requirements—for example, it might require the user to dial
    an area code to make local calls. In such a case, you’ll need a customized Dial
    Plan (also known as a *tenant dial plan*) so users can dial phone numbers the
    way they’re accustomed to, such as omitting the area code for local calls or
    using short-digit dialing to call other users in the same location or office.

    > **Example 2** <br/>Bob also wants to call the phone number +1 311-555-2368. Bob is not
    only in the United States, he’s actually located in the 311 area code. He
    expects to be able to place the call by dialing **555-2368**. You can configure
    Teams to accommodate Bob’s dialing behavior and normalize the phone number to
    the correct format before sending it to the PSTN.

    You can assign different dial plans to different users. This way, you can create
    a specific experience matching the different requirements of your users, for
    example if users in a particular location want a dialing experience that’s
    different from users in another location.

    **Additional information**

    -   For a readiness session training on dial plans, go to [Tenant Dial
    Plans](https://aka.ms/sa-tdp). Although this training was created for Skype
    for Business, it applies to Teams as well because it’s built on the same
    infrastructure.

    1.  Set up emergency addresses and locations

    1.  Assign phone numbers and emergency addresses to users

    1.  Optional: Assign Calling Identity settings to users

    1.  Optional: Assign Dial Plan settings to users

    1.  Assign Teams Calling interop policy

    For a walkthrough of the onboarding process, watch the following video:

    ### 1. Enable Exchange on-premises for Azure Voicemail

    If some of your users have their Exchange mailbox on an Exchange Server
    on-premises, follow the steps in [Azure PBX voicemail support for Exchange
    Server](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3195158/customer-issues-between-exum-and-azure-voicemail)
    to enable it for working with Azure Voicemail.

    ### 2. Validate required licenses

    From the Envision phase, you should have a list of the licenses that make up the
    prerequisites for the implementation of Phone System with Calling Plans for your
    organization:

    -   Microsoft Teams

    -   Skype for Business Online (Plan 2)

    -   Phone System

    -   Domestic Calling Plan, or Domestic and International Calling Plan

    -   Communications Credits (optional)

    > [!NOTE]
    > Phone System license can be obtained as part of Office 365
    Enterprise E5 subscription plan or as an add-in for Office 365 Enterprise E1
    or E3.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If the required licenses aren’t available, you need to
    consult the team in your organization responsible for Office 365
    subscriptions so that they can procure the required licenses.

    ### 3. Assign licenses

    After you’ve confirmed that the required licenses (based on your implementation
    plan) are available, you need to assign the licenses to users.

    Follow the instructions in [Assign Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams
    licenses](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/assign-skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-licenses)
    to perform license assignment for individual or multiple users by using the
    Skype for Business admin center or a remote PowerShell session.

    ### 4. Acquire phone numbers

    Getting phone numbers for a Phone System with Calling Plans implementation can
    be accomplished in multiple ways:

    -   Acquire phone numbers by using the Skype for Business admin center (United
    States and United Kingdom only)

    -   Request phone numbers by submitting a phone number request form

    -   Transfer (or port) existing phone numbers to Microsoft

    ### 5. Set up emergency addresses and locations

    Follow the instructions in  [Add or remove an emergency address for your
    organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/add-or-remove-an-emergency-address-for-your-organization), to set up emergency addresses and locations. For more information, see


    ### 6. Assign phone numbers and emergency address to users

    Follow the instructions in [Assign, change, or remove a phone number for a
    user](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/assign-change-or-remove-a-phone-number-for-a-user), to assign phone numbers and emergency addresses to users.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For the assigned phone numbers to show up in Teams, you must update
    the user’s office phone number in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). You can
    edit this attribute in the Microsoft 365 Admin center if the user was created
    directly in Office 365 or Azure AD). If the user is synchronized from
    on-premises Active Directory, you must use on-premises Active Directory to
    update the office phone number attribute.

    ### 7. Optional: Assign Calling Identity settings to users

    Based on your implementation plan, you might need to configure the Calling
    Identity settings for your users. Follow the instructions in [Set the Caller ID
    for a
    user](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/set-the-caller-id-for-a-user).

    ### 8. Optional: Assign Dial Plan settings to users

    Depending on your organization’s and users’ requirements, you might need to
    assign tenant dial plans to your users. Follow the instructions in [Create and
    manage dial

    ### 9. Assign the Teams calling interop policy

    By default, all calling in Teams is set to Skype for Business without the option
    for users to change the setting.

    For the implementation of Phone System with Calling Plans in Teams, you need to
    assign Teams Interop Policy that specifies calling to use Teams. The policy that
    meets this requirement is DisallowOverrideCallingTeamsChatTeams.

    Assign the policy above to users to be enabled for Phone System with Calling
    Plans in Teams by using the Grant-CsTeamsInteropPolicy:

       ```
       Grant-CsTeamsInteropPolicy -PolicyName tag:DisallowOverrideCallingTeamsChatTeams -Identity user\@contoso.com
       ```

    In this exercise, you’ll enable a user for calling in Teams. Although we don’t
    describe how to perform every action, we recommend some scenarios to try out.

    ### Requirements

    -   An Office 365 tenant with appropriate licenses to enable Phone System with
    Calling Plans

        -   We strongly recommend that you use a dedicated test tenant.

        -   If you don’t have a test tenant, you can sign up for a trial tenant
        here: [Office 365 Enterprise E5
        Trial](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=698279). However,
        Calling Plans are unfortunately not available through trial tenants.

        -   Don’t run any tests in your production environment. Changing settings or
        policies might negatively affect all users and might affect their user
        experience.

    -   Your PC set up for Skype for Business Online management

        -   If you haven’t installed the Skype for Business Online Connector module,
        follow the instructions here: [Configuring your computer for Skype for
        Business Online
        management](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn362839%28v=ocs.15%29.aspx).

        -   To connect PowerShell to Skype for Business Online, follow these
        instructions: [Connecting to Skype for Business Online by using Windows
        PowerShell](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn362795(v=ocs.15).aspx).

    -   At least two endpoints and a phone

        -   This can be two PCs, but you can also use the client in a browser or on
        your mobile phones.

        -   To test PSTN calling, you need to have a phone that can call the country
        or region you’re testing PSTN calling for.

    ### Suggested scenarios to test

    -   Enable a user for Phone System with Calling Plans in Teams.

    -   Sign in as the configured user, and review the **Calls** tab.

    -   Call a PSTN number by using different formats (for example, dial a full
    E.164 number with the leading plus sign or dial a number without using the
    country code).

    -   Test user features such as changing the number for call forwarding,
    transferring calls, or accessing voicemail.

    Now that you have properly planned and implemented Phone System in your
    environment, you need to be sure that it’s used and provides a great user
    experience. Although complete details would exceed the scope of this training,
    we want to point out the most important areas of engagement:

    -   Adoption and change management
    Users might simply start using the service when you offer it to them. Or
    they might not. Therefore, it’s important to execute proper adoption and
    change management.

    -   Monitoring and driving usage
    We recommend that one of your KSIs be the number of active users, to help
    you measure how well Teams is being accepted as a phone client.

    -   Monitoring and driving quality

    The satisfaction of your users is directly related to the quality of their
    calls; therefore, it’s important that you monitor call quality and improve
    it, if necessary. To understand how to report on call quality, visit the
    Call Quality Dashboard training. Although these videos have been built for
    Skype for Business, they apply to Teams as well: <https://aka.ms/sof-cqd>.
