# Manage phone numbers for Calling Plan and services

There are four ways to get user (subscriber) and service (toll and toll-free) phone numbers for Microsoft Calling Plan and services, such as Audio Conferencing, Auto Attendants, and Call Queues:

- [Get new user phone numbers in the Microsoft Teams admin center](getting-phone-numbers-for-your-users.md#get-new-phone-numbers-for-your-users).
- [Get new service phone numbers in the Microsoft Teams admin center](getting-service-phone-numbers.md#get-new-service-numbers).
- [Transfer or port your existing phone numbers with us](phone-number-calling-plans/transfer-phone-numbers-to-teams.md#create-a-port-order-and-transfer-your-phone-numbers-to-teams).
- Use a request form for new phone numbers that aren't listed in the Teams admin center.

For information about how many phone numbers you can get, see [How many phone numbers can you get](how-many-phone-numbers-can-you-get.md).

> [!NOTE]
> For country/region specifics, be sure to check the phone number management article for that country/region. For example, for information about Australia, see [Phone number management for Australia](/microsoftteams/phone-reference/manage-numbers/phone-number-management-for-australia).

***

**Use the drop-down to select the country/region where you're getting numbers. You'll find information about availability, and the downloadable PDF LOA forms you'll need for porting numbers. Additional documentation might be necessary.**

## Number request forms

The following sections describe request forms for new numbers and for transferring existing numbers.

### Request forms for new phone numbers

Each country or region has different instructions, different types of phone numbers (geographic/non-geographic and service (toll/toll-free)), and rules/regulations for getting phone numbers so they can be used in Microsoft Teams.

Sometimes (depending on your country or region) you won't be able to get new user (subscriber) or service (toll or toll-free) phone numbers using the Microsoft Teams admin center, or you might need specific phone numbers (vanity requests) or specific area codes.

If you need help, [contact the TNS Service Desk](contact-tns-service-desk.md).

### Letters of Authorization (LOAs) to transfer/port existing phone numbers

If you need to transfer/port your existing phone numbers from another service provider to Teams, you'll need to download, fill out, sign, and send us a Letter of Authorization (LOA). The LOA gives Microsoft permission to request and transfer, on your behalf, those existing numbers from a different service provider into Teams.

Once you have the **filled and signed** LOA, upload the documents in the Microsoft Teams admin center. For special cases such as a large number ports (1000+), complex ports, or if you need assistance, [contact our TNS Service Desk](contact-tns-service-desk.md).

## Still need assistance?

If you need assistance, [contact the TNS Service Desk](contact-tns-service-desk.md).

To create a case for directory services, see [Create a new case.](/microsoftteams/phone-reference/manage-numbers/contact-tns-service-desk)

## Additional resources
