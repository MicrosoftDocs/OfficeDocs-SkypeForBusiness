# Sample script - Microsoft Teams firewall PowerShell script

This sample script, which needs to run on client computers in the context of an elevated administrator account, will create a new inbound firewall rule for each user folder found in c:\users. When Teams finds this rule, it will prevent the Teams application from prompting users to create firewall rules when the users make their first call from Teams.

```powershell

<#

$users = Get-ChildItem (Join-Path -Path $env:SystemDrive -ChildPath 'Users') -Exclude 'Public', 'ADMINI~*'
if ($null -ne $users) {
    foreach ($user in $users) {
        $progPath = Join-Path -Path $user.FullName -ChildPath "AppData\Local\Microsoft\Teams\Current\Teams.exe"
        if (Test-Path $progPath) {
            if (-not (Get-NetFirewallApplicationFilter -Program $progPath -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)) {
                $ruleName = "Teams.exe for user $($user.Name)"
                "UDP", "TCP" | ForEach-Object { New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName $ruleName -Direction Inbound -Profile Domain -Program $progPath -Action Allow -Protocol $_ }
                Clear-Variable ruleName
            }
        }
