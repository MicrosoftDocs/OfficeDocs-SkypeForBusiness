# Cloud voice deployment

Microsoft Teams, the hub for teamwork and communications in Office 365, now provides Audio Conferencing, Phone System with Calling Plans, and Phone System Direct Routing capabilities to meet additional business requirements by extending the Teams meeting and calling experience to include external parties connected via the public switched telephone network (PSTN).
 
We’ll update this page as additional cloud voice features for Teams are released over time.



## Audio Conferencing in Microsoft Teams


Audio Conferencing in Office 365 allows participants to join your Teams meetings from any telephone.

Here’s what you get with [Audio Conferencing](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/audio-conferencing-in-office-365/audio-conferencing-in-office-365) in Office 365.


## Phone System with Calling Plans (“Calling Plans”) in Microsoft Teams

Phone System is an Office 365 feature that provides the ability to manage call routing, policies, and user provisioning. This includes phone calling management system, call routing, and call control.

Calling Plans is an add-on service for the Phone System feature, delivered through Teams and Skype for Business Online. Calling Plans requires that the user in question be homed in Skype for Business Online to work in Microsoft Teams. Calling Plans provide the people in your business with a primary phone number, and lets them make and receive phone calls outside of your organization over the PSTN.

To learn more, read [Here’s what you get with Phone System in Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-is-phone-system-in-office-365/here-s-what-you-get-with-phone-system) and [What are Calling Plans in Office 365?](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365)


## Phone System Direct Routing (“Direct Routing”)

Direct Routing works with the Phone System feature to give people in your organization the ability make and receive phone calls outside of the organization over the PSTN, where PSTN connectivity is provided via third-party service providers.

To learn more, read [Plan Direct Routing](direct-routing-plan.md) and [Configure Direct Routing](direct-routing-configure.md).

## Practical guidance for Audio Conferencing, Calling Plans, and Direct Routing in Microsoft Teams

This practical guidance is organized by using the Office 365 FastTrack customer journey framework and its three phases&mdash;Envision, Onboard, and Drive Value. It’s intended to help you plan, deliver, and operate a successful Audio Conferencing, Calling Plans, or Direct Routing implementation.

The content is presented in an ordered fashion, and is designed to take you through an end-to-end deployment journey from start to finish. If you’re already actively deploying, we still encourage you to reference the applicable content areas.
