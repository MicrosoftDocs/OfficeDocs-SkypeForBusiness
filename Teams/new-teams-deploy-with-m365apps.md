# Deploy the new Microsoft Teams with Microsoft 365 Apps

Starting in late August, new Teams will automatically install with new and existing installations of Microsoft 365 Apps on Windows.

Currently, users can install the new Microsoft Teams using the "Try the new Teams" toggle switch in classic Teams or by Admins bulk deploying directly to the computers in their organization.

Administrators may exclude new Teams from automatically installing with Microsoft 365 Apps on Windows.

>[!Important]
>If the classic Teams app is already installed, the Microsoft 365 Apps deployment will install new Teams alongside classic Teams on the device. The classic Teams installation will not change.

## Is the new Teams available for my organization?

The new Teams client **is not** yet available for the following customers but is planned for release later in this calendar year:

**Platforms:**  Mac, VDI, Web</br>
**Customer segments:**  </br>- Government clouds: GCC, GCC High, DoD</br>- Special cloud: Air-gapped, Microsoft 365 operated by 21Vianet in China </br>- Consumer


## Rollout schedule 

### When will the new Microsoft Teams be included with installations of Microsoft 365 Apps?

The date when the new Teams starts being installed with Microsoft 365 Apps depends on which update channel you're using. The following table shows the schedule.

## How to exclude new Microsoft Teams from new installations of Microsoft 365 Apps 

Admins who don't want new Teams included with Microsoft 365 Apps on devices running Windows can follow these steps to opt out. 

1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 Apps admin center (https://config.office.com) with an admin account. 
2. Go to **Customization > Device Configuration > Modern Apps Settings**. 
3. Select **Microsoft Teams (work or school)**,  then clear the **Enable automatic installation of new Microsoft Teams** check box. 

>[!Note]
>For the best Teams experience, we recommend leaving the setting as is. 

## Direct deploy on your own timeline

If you choose to not have Microsoft manage the new Teams deployment for you, pick a  time that is best for you. Deploy new Teams by following the steps detailed in this article: [**Bulk Deploy the new Teams client**](new-teams-bulk-install-client.md).


## What about Office 365 plans that don't include Microsoft Teams? 
 
Some Office 365 plans include Microsoft 365 Apps, but don't include the Teams service. Teams will still be installed with Microsoft 365 Apps even if a plan doesn't have the Teams service. 

For Office 365 plans that don't include the Teams service, a free trial version of Teams, valid for one year, is available. Your users can start using it when they sign in to Teams. For more information about this free trial version and providing your users access, see Manage the Microsoft Teams Commercial Cloud Trial offer.
