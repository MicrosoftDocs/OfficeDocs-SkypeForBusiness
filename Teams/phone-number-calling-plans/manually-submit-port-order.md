# Manually submit a port order

In some countries and regions, you may have to manually submit a service request to get phone numbers, transfer phone numbers, release phone numbers, or change addresses. To see what's required for each country and region or to learn more about number porting, see [Manage phone numbers for your organization](../manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization.md).

Use the steps in this article to manually submit a port order if your country or region isn't listed in the [porting wizard in the Microsoft ](transfer-phone-numbers-to-teams.md).

## Manually submit a new port order request

To manually submit a new port order, send your completed Letter of Authorization (LOA) form directly to the TNS service desk for your region.

1. Download the [LOA](../manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization.md) for your country or region.
2. Complete the form.
3. Send it to the [TNS service desk](../manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/contact-tns-service-desk.md) for your region.
