# Manually submit a port order

In some countries and regions, you may have to manually submit a service request to get phone numbers, transfer phone numbers, release phone numbers, or change addresses. To see what's required for each country and region or to learn more about number porting, see [Manage phone numbers for your organization](../manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization.md).

Use the steps in this article to manually create and submit a port order if your country or region isn't listed in the [porting wizard in the Microsoft Teams admin center](transfer-phone-numbers-to-teams.md).

## Manually submit a port order request

You can manually submit a port order by creating a service request in the Microsoft 365 admin center or by sending your completed Letter of Authorization (LOA) form directly to the PSTN service desk for your region.

### Submit a service request in the Microsoft 365 admin center

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Support** > **New service request**.  If you don't see **Support** listed, add it by going to **Customize navigation** in the left navigation, and then select the **Support** check box.
2. In the **Need help?** pane, select **Contact support**.
3. In the **Contact support** pane, do the following:

    1. Enter a title (for example, Port order request) and description for your request, confirm your phone number and email address, and select your preferred contact method.
    2. Under **Attachments**, click **Add a file**, and then upload your completed [LOA](../manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization.md#letters-of-authorization-loas-for-transferring-numbers).
    3. Click **Contact me**.

### Send your Letter of Authorization directly to the PSTN service desk

Download the [LOA](../manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization.md#letters-of-authorization-loas-for-transferring-numbers) for your country or region, complete the form, and then send it to the [PSTN service desk](../manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/contact-pstn-service-desk.md) for your region:

- In the U.S., [send your request](mailto:ptn@microsoft.com).
- In Europe, [send your request](mailto:ptneu@microsoft.com).
- In Asia, [send your request](mailto:ptnapac@microsoft.com).
  
## What else should you know about number porting?

- You must assign the new phone numbers you have to each of your users. See[Assign, change, or remove a phone number for a user](../assign-change-or-remove-a-phone-number-for-a-user.md).
