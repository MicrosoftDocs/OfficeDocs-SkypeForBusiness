# What's the status of your port orders?

To see the status of your port order, in the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to  > **Voice** > **Port orders**, and then click **Order history**. Each port order status is listed in the **Status** column. See [how long does it take to port numbers](../phone-number-calling-plans/port-order-overview.md#how-long-does-it-take-to-port-numbers) to learn about the order process. 

The following table lists port order statuses, as well as actions you can take if needed.

|**Status**|**Can you view the order?**|**Can you edit the order?**|**Can you cancel the order?**|**Can you delete the order?**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**Processing** <br/> |Yes  <br/> |No  <br/> |Yes  <br/> |No  <br/> |The admin created the order, and it's been received by Microsoft.  <br/> |
|**Contacting carrier** <br/> |Yes  <br/> |No  <br/> |Yes  <br/> |No  <br/> |The order has been received and approved by Microsoft, and we're working with the losing carrier to get it approved.  <br/> |
|**Transfer approved** <br/> |Yes  <br/> |No  <br/> |Yes  <br/> |No  <br/> |The order has been accepted by the losing carrier, and the Firm Order Commitment (FOC) date has been set.  <br/> |
|**Transfer pending** <br/> |Yes  <br/> |No  <br/> |No  <br/> |No  <br/> |The transfer is less than 24 hours away, so the order can no longer be edited or cancelled.  <br/> |
|**Error** <br/> |No  <br/> |Yes  <br/> |Yes  <br/> |Yes (at this time, you can't delete the port order if there's an error. The port order needs to be re-created, or you need to contact the [TNS Service Desk](../manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/contact-tns-service-desk.md).  <br/> |The losing carrier rejected the order.  <br/> |
|**Completed** <br/> |Yes  <br/> |No  <br/> |No  <br/> |No  <br/> |The numbers have been successfully transferred.  <br/> |
|**Cancelled** <br/> |No  <br/> |Yes  <br/> |No  <br/> |No  <br/> |The admin canceled the order.  <br/> |
