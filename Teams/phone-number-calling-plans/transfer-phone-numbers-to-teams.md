# Transfer phone numbers to Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE [preview-feature](../includes/preview-feature.md)]

Use the porting wizard in the Microsoft Teams admin center to transfer your phone numbers from your current service provider to Teams. After you port your phone numbers to Teams, Microsoft will become your service provider and will bill you for those phone numbers.

Before you start, we recommend that you review the information in [What's a port order?](port-order-overview.md) If you have service numbers for dial-in conferencing bridges, auto attendants or other service numbers, toll-free phone numbers, or have more than 999 user (subscriber) phone numbers that you need to transfer to Teams, see [Manage phone numbers for your organization](../manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization.md) to download the correct forms and send them to us.

  > [!NOTE]
  > We process port orders for transferring phone numbers only on United States business days and not on public holidays or weekends.

## Create a port order and transfer your phone numbers to Teams

> [!NOTE]
> **Currently, you can use this wizard to get phone numbers for the United Kingdom, United States, and Canada**. To get phone numbers for other countries and regions, you can [manually submit a port order](manually-submit-port-order.md). To get the form you need to manually submit a port order, select your country or region in the drop-down list in [Manage phone numbers for your organization](../manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization.md).

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Voice** > **Phone numbers**. Click **Numbers**, and then click **Port** to start the porting wizard.
2. Review the information on the **Get started** page, and then when you're ready, click **Next**.
3. On the **Select location and number type** page, specify the following, and then click **Next**:

    - **Country or region**: Country or region where you're getting numbers.
    - **Phone number type**: Type of number, such as geographic or toll-free numbers.
    - **Numbers assigned to**: What the numbers are assigned to. For example, users, or conferencing or voice features.

4. On the **Add account information** page, complete the following, and then click **Next**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The information displayed on this page is determined by the country or region and number type. Each country and region have different regulations on the information that's required to port numbers. What you see on this page may be different from what's described here.

    - **Order details**: 
        - **Order name**: Name of your order
        - **Notification emails**: Email addresses to receive order notifications. If you enter multiple email addresses, separate each with a semicolon.
        - **Transferred date**: Transfer date issued by your current service provider.
    - **Phone number details**
        - **Port type**: Whether you're doing a full-port to transfer all your numbers or a partial-port to transfer some of your numbers.
    - **Person requesting details**  
        - Your organization name and contact details of the person requesting the transfer.
    - **Current provider's details**
        - **Billing telephone number (BTN)**: Your BTN in E.164 format, which requires a + sign to prepend the number. For example, for a North America number, use +1XXXYYYZZZZ format.
        - Other details including the name of your current service provider, your account number, and your service address.
            
5. On the **Add numbers** page, click **Select a file**, browse to and select the CSV file that contains the phone numbers that you want to transfer, and then click **Next**.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > The CSV file must have only one column with a header named PhoneNumber. Each phone number must be on a separate row and can be digits only or in E.164 format.

6. On the **Complete your order** page, click **Upload a signed Letter of Authorization** to upload a scanned copy of the signed Letter of Authorization (LOA).

    If you haven't already downloaded and signed the LOA, do the following:
    
    1. Click **Download the template** to download the LOA for your country or region. 
    2. Print the LOA.
    3. Have the LOA signed by the person who is authorized to make changes to the account.
    4. Scan the signed LOA, and then click **Upload a signed Letter of Authorization** to upload it.

    > [!NOTE]
    > After you upload your LOA, submit your order. Just uploading the LOA isn't sufficient. You have to also submit the order for it be processed.

7. Review your order details, and then click **Submit**.


## What happens next?

When we receive your port order, you'll get an email that verifies your request. Your request is checked and updated daily and you'll be notified of its progress and status in email. If your port request is rejected by the losing carrier, contact the [PSTN service desk](../manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/contact-pstn-service-desk.md).

To view the status of your port order, in the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to  > **Voice** > **Port orders**, and then click **Order history**. Each port order status is listed in the **Status** column. To learn more, see [What's the status of your port orders?](port-order-status.md)
