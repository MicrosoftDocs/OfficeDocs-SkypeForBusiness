# Deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms with Exchange Online

Read this topic for information on how to deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms with Exchange Online and Skype for Business Server on-premises.
  
If your organization has a mix of services, with some hosted on premises and some hosted online, then your configuration will depend on where each service is hosted. This topic covers hybrid deployments for Microsoft Teams Rooms with Exchange hosted online. Because there are so many different variations in this type of deployment, it's not possible to provide detailed instructions for all of them. The following process will work for many configurations. If the process isn't right for your setup, we recommend that you use Windows PowerShell to achieve the same end result as documented here, and for other deployment options.

The easiest way to set up user accounts is to configure them using remote Windows PowerShell. Microsoft provides [SkypeRoomProvisioningScript.ps1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=870105), a script that will help create new user accounts, or validate existing resource accounts you have in order to help you turn them into compatible Microsoft Teams Rooms user accounts. If you prefer, you can follow the steps below to configure accounts your Microsoft Teams Rooms device will use.

## Requirements

Before you deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms with Exchange Online, be sure you have met the requirements. For more information, see [Microsoft Teams Rooms requirements](requirements.md).
  
To deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms with Exchange Online, follow the steps below. Be sure you have the right permissions to run the associated cmdlets. 

   > [!NOTE]
   >  The [Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/active-directory/overview?view=azureadps-1.0) in this section (for example,  Set-MsolUser) have been tested in setting up accounts for Microsoft Teams Rooms devices. It's possible that other cmdlets may work, however, they haven't been tested in this specific scenario.
  
### Create an account and set Exchange properties

1. Start a remote Windows PowerShell session on a PC and connect to Exchange Online as follows:

``` Powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
$org='contoso.microsoft.com'
$cred=Get-Credential $admin@$org
$sess= New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/ -Credential $cred -Authentication Basic  -AllowRedirection
```

2. After establishing a session, you'll either create a new mailbox and enable it as a RoomMailboxAccount, or change the settings for an existing room mailbox. This will allow the account to authenticate into Microsoft Teams Rooms.

   If you're changing an existing resource mailbox:

   ``` Powershell
   Set-Mailbox -Identity 'PROJECTRIGEL01' -EnableRoomMailboxAccount $true -RoomMailboxPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String <password> -AsPlainText -Force)
   ```

    If you're creating a new resource mailbox:

   ``` Powershell
   New-Mailbox -MicrosoftOnlineServicesID 'PROJECTRIGEL01@contoso.com' -Alias PROJECTRIGEL01 -Name "Project-Rigel-01" -Room -EnableRoomMailboxAccount $true -RoomMailboxPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String <password> -AsPlainText -Force)
   ```

3. To improve the meeting experience, you'll need to set the Exchange properties on the user account as follows:

   ``` Powershell
   Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity 'PROJECTRIGEL01@contoso.com' -AutomateProcessing AutoAccept -AddOrganizerToSubject $false -AllowConflicts $false -DeleteComments $false -DeleteSubject $false -RemovePrivateProperty $false
   Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity 'PROJECTRIGEL01@contoso.com' -AddAdditionalResponse $true -AdditionalResponse "This is a Skype Meeting room!"
   ```



### Add an email address for your on-premises domain account

1. In **Active Directory Users and Computers AD** tool, right-click on the container or Organizational Unit that your Microsoft Teams Rooms accounts will be created in, click **New**, and then click **User**.
2. Type the display name (- Identity ) from the prior cmdlet (Set-Mailbox or New-Mailbox) into the **Full name** box, and the alias into the **User logon name** box. Click **Next**.
3. Type the password for this account. You'll need to retype it for verification. Make sure the **Password never expires** checkbox is the only option selected.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Selecting **Password never expires** is a requirement for Skype for Business Server on Microsoft Teams Rooms. Your domain rules may prohibit passwords that don't expire. If so, you'll need to create an exception for each Microsoft Teams Rooms user account.
  
4. Click **Finish** to create the account.
5. After you have created the account, run a directory synchronization. This can be accomplished by using [Set-MsolDirSyncConfiguration](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/msonline/set-msoldirsyncconfiguration?view=azureadps-1.0) in PowerShell. When that is complete, go to the users page and verify that the two accounts created in the previous steps have merged.

### Assign an Office 365 license

1. First, connect to Azure AD to apply some account settings. You can run this cmdlet to connect. For details about Active Directory, see [Azure ActiveDirectory (MSOnline) 1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/active-directory/overview?view=azureadps-1.0). 

   > [!NOTE]
   > [Azure Active Directory PowerShell 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/active-directory/overview?view=azureadps-2.0) is not supported. 

  ``` PowerShell
 Connect-MsolService -Credential $cred
  ```
<!--   ``` Powershell
   Connect-AzureAD -Credential $cred
   ``` -->

2. The user account needs to have a valid Office 365 license to ensure that Exchange and Skype for Business Server will work. If you have the license, you need to assign a usage location to your user accountâ€”this determines what license SKUs are available for your account. You'll make the assignment in a following step.
3. Next, use `Get-MsolAccountSku` <!--Get-AzureADSubscribedSku--> to retrieve a list of available SKUs for your Office 365 tenant.
4. Once you list out the SKUs, you can add a license using the `Set-MsolUserLicense` <!-- Set-AzureADUserLicense--> cmdlet. In this case, $strLicense is the SKU code that you see (for example, contoso:STANDARDPACK). 

  ```
    Set-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName 'PROJECTRIGEL01@contoso.com' -UsageLocation 'US'
   Get-MsolAccountSku
   Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName 'PROJECTRIGEL01@contoso.com' -AddLicenses $strLicense
  ```
<!--   ``` Powershell
   Set-AzureADUserLicense -UserPrincipalName 'PROJECTRIGEL01@contoso.com' -UsageLocation 'US'
   Get-AzureADSubscribedSku
   Set-AzureADUserLicense -UserPrincipalName 'PROJECTRIGEL01@contoso.com' -AddLicenses $strLicense
   ``` -->

### Enable the user account with Skype for Business Server

1. Create a remote Windows PowerShell session from a PC as follows:

    ``` Powershell
    Import-Module SkypeOnlineConnector  
    $cssess=New-CsOnlineSession -Credential $cred  
    Import-PSSession $cssess -AllowClobber
    ```

2. To enable your Microsoft Teams Rooms account for Skype for Business Server, run this command:

   ``` Powershell
   Enable-CsMeetingRoom -Identity $rm -RegistrarPool 'sippoolbl20a04.infra.lync.com' -SipAddressType EmailAddress
   ```

    If you aren't sure what value to use for the RegistrarPool parameter in your environment, you can get the value from an existing Skype for Business Server user using this command

   ``` Powershell
   Get-CsOnlineUser -Identity 'alice@contoso.com'| fl *registrarpool*
   ```

### Assign a Skype for Business Server license to your Microsoft Teams Rooms account

1. Log in as a tenant administrator, open the Office 365 Administrative Portal, and click on the Admin app.
2. Click on **Users and Groups** and then click **Add users, reset passwords, and more**.
3. Click the Microsoft Teams Rooms account, and then click the pen icon to edit the account information.
4. Click **Licenses**.
5. In **Assign licenses**, select Skype for Business (Plan 2) or Skype for Business (Plan 3), depending on your licensing and Enterprise Voice requirements. You'll have to use a Plan 3 license if you want to use Enterprise Voice on Microsoft Teams Rooms.
6. Click **Save**.

For validation, you should be able to use any Skype for Business client to log in to this account.
