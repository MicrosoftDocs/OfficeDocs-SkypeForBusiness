# Teams Meeting Room Licensing Update 

## Licensing Solutions for Shared Communication Devices

Microsoft has and dedicated SKU for licensing meetings and calling on a per-device basis for meeting room devices (such as Microsoft Teams Rooms and Microsoft Surface Hub).

||Microsoft Room SKU |  
|:--- |:---: |
|Skype for Business |&#x2714;|
|Microsoft Teams|  &#x2714;|
|Phone Systems|  &#x2714;|
|Audio Conferencing|&#x2714; &sup1;|
|Microsoft Intune|&#x2714;|  
|Worldwide Availability | &#x2714; &sup2;|
|Channel Availability | EA, EAS, CSP, <br>Web Direct |
| | | |

&sup1; Availability and included minutes may vary by region. To verify service availability, refer to  [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](http://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans). Consumption charges may apply for additional services, such as toll-free, international minutes for domestic plans, etc. Customers can disable these features to avoid additional billing.  

&sup2; Not available in sovereign clouds  


> [!NOTE]
> If you are currently using E1, E3, E4, E5, GCC or GCC High and DoD SKUs with Skype for Business Standalone Plan 1 or Skype for Business Plan 2 or Skype for Business Plan 2 with Audio conferencing or with Office365 Phone System and a Calling Plan, these will continue to work. However, you should consider moving to a simpler licensing model in the table above after current licenses expire.  

The following table lists the features that are available in Microsoft Teams Rooms and what licenses you need to buy to get them.
