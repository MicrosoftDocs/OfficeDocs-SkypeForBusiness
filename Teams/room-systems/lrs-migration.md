# Migrate Lync Room System (LRS) devices to Microsoft Teams Rooms

Lync Room System (LRS) devices with Skype Room System Version 1 (SRS v1) software has reached [end of support on October 9, 2018](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4043450/products-reaching-end-of-support-for-2018). This means Skype Room Systems v1 software will no longer get any product updates or fixes anymore. Customers with Lync Room System devices using Skype Room System v1 software are advised to upgrade their devices to Microsoft Teams Rooms.

Microsoft Teams Rooms software works with Microsoft Teams in addition to Skype for Business Server and Online services for meetings and calling on all Microsoft Teams Rooms supported devices.

Your existing devices **may** continue to work after the end of Skype Room System v1 software support. However, if this software hits a software bug that needs Microsoft to release a fix, it will not be supported. SRS v1 uses TLS 1.0/ 1.1 which will be deprecated by Microsoft in the future. You can learn more about [Preparing for TLS 1.0/1.1 Deprecation](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Skype-for-Business-Blog/Preparing-for-TLS-1-0-1-1-Deprecation-O365-Skype-for-Business/bc-p/223608). Microsoft Teams Rooms is adding support for TLS 1.2 and will continue to work past October 31, 2018. Skype for Business on-premises customers should not disable TLS 1.0/1.1 until Microsoft Teams Rooms announces support for TLS 1.2 regardless of general guidelines on TLS 1.0/1.1 deprecation.

## Which devices are affected?

## What should you do?

We recommend you plan to update Lync Room System devices to Microsoft Teams Rooms before TLS 1.0/1.1 deprecation using upgrade options mentioned above. Additionally, you may also consider replacing existing devices with new devices certified for Microsoft Teams Rooms. See [Room devices](https://aka.ms/roomdevices) for details and also take a look at [Microsoft Teams Rooms requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/skypeforbusiness/plan-your-deployment/clients-and-devices/requirements).  

> [!NOTE]
> Touch and whiteboard functionality is not yet supported in Microsoft Teams Rooms. Touch and whiteboard support is currently planned for Microsoft Teams Rooms and will be added in 2019.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Teams Rooms software supports the TLS 1.2 protocol as of December 14, 2018 with app version 4.0.64.0. For on-premises customers, enabling communication over TLS 1.2 for Microsoft Teams Rooms requires Skype for Business Server 2015 Cumulative Update 9 (CU9) or Skype for Business Server 2019 Cumulative Update 1 (CU1). The change should not affect Skype for Business Online customers as client changes are forward and backward compliant.
