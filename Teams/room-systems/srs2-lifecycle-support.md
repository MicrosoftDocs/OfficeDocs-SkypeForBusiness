# Version support
 
Microsoft plans to release updates for Microsoft Teams Rooms a few times per year with each update supported for twelve (12) months from its general availability (GA) release date. Technical support will be provided for the entire twelve (12) months. However, our support structure is now dynamic, evolving into two distinct servicing phases that depend on the availability of the latest  version.

Servicing and Critical Updates servicing phase When running the latest  version of Microsoft Teams Rooms, you will receive regular updates, that contain Security and Servicing updates.


Security Updates (Only) servicing phase After a new  version is released, support for older branches will reduce to Security updates only for the remainder of the twelve (12) month Servicing Updates support lifecycle.


> [!NOTE]
> The latest version is always in the Servicing and Critical Updates servicing phase. This means that in the event that you encounter a code defect that warrants a critical update, you must have the latest version installed in order to receive a fix. All other supported  versions will only be eligible to receive security updates.

All support ends after the twelve (12) month lifecycle for a version has expired or if more than two updates have been released since then. At that time, customers must update to a supported  version.

All releases are listed in the [Microsoft Teams Rooms release notes](srs2-release-note.md).
