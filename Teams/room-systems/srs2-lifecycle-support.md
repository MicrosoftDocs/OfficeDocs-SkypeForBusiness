# Microsoft Teams Room app version support
 
Microsoft plans to release updates for Microsoft Teams Rooms a few times per year with each update supported for twelve (12) months from its general availability (GA) release date. Technical support will be provided for the entire twelve (12) months. However, our support structure is now dynamic, evolving into two distinct servicing phases that depend on the availability of the latest version.

**Servicing and Critical Updates servicing phase** \- When running the latest version of Microsoft Teams Rooms, you will receive regular updates, that contain Security and Servicing updates.

**Security Updates (Only) servicing phase** \- After a new  version is released, support for older branches will reduce to Security updates only for the remainder of the twelve (12) month Servicing Updates support lifecycle.

> [!NOTE]
> The latest version is always in the Servicing and Critical Updates servicing phase. This means that in the event that you encounter a code defect that warrants a critical update, you must have the latest version installed in order to receive a fix. All other supported  versions will only be eligible to receive security updates.

All support ends after the twelve (12) month lifecycle for a version has expired or if more than two updates have been released since then. At that time, customers must update to a supported  version.

All releases are listed in the [Microsoft Teams Rooms release notes](srs2-release-note.md).

# OS Version support
Windows 10 feature updates for devices running Microsoft Teams Rooms are not offered for 6 months from the time when Windows makes a release update. This is accomplished by putting a special block for Microsoft Teams Rooms devices on Windows Update for Business channel (i.e. Semi-Annual Channel) and through the app settings. During this blocked period Microsoft performs various tests both in house and through our device OEM partners to make sure that new Windows 10 feature release is working in harmony with the Microsoft Teams Rooms app and peripherals connected to it. This is important to both ensure device security, consistent user experience and to make sure quality of experiences offered through Microsoft Teams Rooms app.   

From the time block is lifted (i.e. Window 10 feature update is offered to download on these devices), Microsoft Teams Rooms supports the specific Windows 10 feature release for 12-month period in line with App support policy. Since Windows 10 feature updates are offered about every 6 months, this also means that Microsoft Teams will have two additional releases to test by the time support for current version is ended. This also means that a Windows 10 version will be unblocked every 6 months to all Microsoft Teams Rooms customers. As we are continuously making app changes and are developing against last unblocked Windows release, in some cases need to take dependency on Windows features available in newer versions of Windows and the fact that it makes it harder for Microsoft to make changes to the version that is 12-18 months old. To ensure you get the app fix for an issue your encounter on your Microsoft Teams Rooms device, we urge all customers to upgrade these devices to latest Windows 10 feature update offered to stay within supported windows version guidance.

As such, Microsoft Teams Rooms requires Windows 10 versions 1709 as minimum supported version starting May 2019. No new app releases will be offered to systems on Windows 10 Versions 1703 or below.
