# Manage Windows Updates

Microsoft Teams Rooms runs on Windows 10 Enterprise IoT or Windows 10 Enterprise (VL) and receives the same Windows Updates and OS builds as a standard desktop.

Windows Updates can be managed in a few different ways:

## Hands-off approach 

- Updates can be downloaded directly from Windows Updates automatically and installed during off-hours. This is the default configuration.
- Non-deferrable Updates install day-one of release automatically.
- Quality Updates and drivers download and install day-one automatically.
- Feature Updates. See the notes that follow.

## Windows Updates for Business (GPO or Intune)  

- [Windows Updates for Business](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/update/waas-manage-updates-wufb) download
- Updates are downloaded from WU or your WSUS but with configured delays past the KB’s original release date.
- Used with multiple OU’s or filtered policies, you can create deployment “rings” where administrators can specify which devices install Quality Updates first and which ones install later. This allows for reliability and performance testing on a subset of systems before rolling out updates across the entire deployment without the overhead of managing Windows Updates in SCCM for example.
- WSUS and Windows Updates for Business can be [configured at the same time](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/update/waas-integrate-wufb) if you desire both the bandwidth management and the control Windows Updates for Business provides.
- Feature updates. See the notes that follow.

## WSUS/SCCM

- [WSUS/SCCM](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/update/waas-manage-updates-configuration-manager) download
- Much like Windows Update for Business, but with the additional option of targeting specific KB's within each "ring" or the entire deployment. Each Update can be individually deployed and tested at will, rather than relying on only a delay.
- Feature updates. See the notes that follow.

### Feature updates

Unlike Quality and Non-Deferrable updates, Windows 10 "Feature Updates" (major OS releases) will only be installed after Microsoft tests and validates a given updates functionality with Microsoft Teams Rooms. Even if the update is released to the Semi-Annual Channel (or Targeted if you have systems set to that channel for testing) or manually pushed, a Microsoft Room Systems device won't allow the untested update to install.

Microsoft Teams Rooms "out-of-box", using the hands off approach, will not install a Windows Update or reboot a device automatically for a Windows Update. Systems may download an update and wait for the next reboot to install it. Unless someone reboots it manually, installation should happen at the automatic nightly reboot. Windows Updates should be transparent in the room, the UI should never be interrupted by Windows Updates.

If you choose to domain joined devices, use SCCM or WSUS. Pay special attention to policies or actions that may result in the device installing an update or forcing a reboot during business hours. Systems in your deployment should not reboot during use or alert about Windows Updates over the UI during usage hours, review your configuration if that behavior happens.
