# Manage Microsoft Teams Rooms devices with Azure Monitor

This article discusses how to manage Microsoft Teams Rooms devices in an integrated, end-to-end manner using Azure Monitor.

You can configure Azure Monitor to provide basic telemetry that will help you manage Skype meeting room devices (see [Plan Microsoft Teams Rooms management with Azure Monitor](azure-monitor-plan.md) and [Deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms management with Azure Monitor]((azure-monitor-deploy.md) for details). As your management solution matures, you can use additional data and management capabilities to create a more detailed view of device performance.

## Understand the log entries

The following event descriptions are inserted into the event log description field every five minutes, when the Microsoft Teams Room app records the corresponding information in the Windows event log. The Microsoft Monitoring Agent passes these records to Log Analytics in Azure Monitor, which parses them into the dashboard you created in [Deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms management with Azure Monitor](azure-monitor-deploy.md). Using the dashboard you can look at individual log entries to determine courses of action if needed. 

Event IDs 2000 and 3000 indicate the device in question is working as expected. Event IDs 2001 and 3001 indicate an issue was found. Event ID 4000 may require action if it is seen more often than you expect, compared to a baseline you set or other deployed devices in your organization.

Understanding these event descriptions alerts you to problems quickly, and provides a starting point for further troubleshooting.

| 2000  <br> Information | This is a healthy heartbeat event. Every 5 minutes, Microsoft Teams Rooms checks that it is signed in to Microsoft Teams or Skype for Business and has network and Exchange connectivity. <br> If all 3 factors are true, it will write Event ID 2000 into the event log every 5 minutes until the device is offline or one or more of the conditions is no longer met. | {"Description":"Heartbeat is healthy.", "ResourceState":"Healthy", "OperationName":"Heartbeat", "OperationResult":"Pass", "OS":"Windows 10", "OSVersion":"10.0.14393.693", "Alias":"alias<span></span>@contoso.com",  "DisplayName":"Display name", "AppVersion":"1.0.38.0", "IPv4Address":"10.10.10.10",  "IPv6Address":"IP v6 address"} <br><br> In this example, all heartbeat conditions were met and the Microsoft Teams Rooms device was marked as being healthy. If there were errors, the app would record Event ID 2001 instead. |
| 2001  <br> Error | This is an app error event. Every 5 minutes, Microsoft Teams Rooms checks that it is signed in to Microsoft Teams or Skype for Business with network and Exchange connectivity. If one or more factors are not true, it will write EventID 2001 into the event log every 5 minutes until the device is offline or all of the conditions are able to be met once again.  | {"Description":"Network status : Healthy. Exchange status : Connected. **Signin status: Unhealthy.** ", "ResourceState":"Unhealthy", "OperationName":"Heartbeat", "OperationResult":"Fail", "OS":"Windows 10", "OSVersion":"10.0.14393.693", "Alias":"", "DisplayName":"Display Name", "AppVersion":"1.0.38.0", "IPv4Address":"10.10.10.10", "IPv6Address":"ip v6 address"} <br><br>  In this example, Microsoft Teams Rooms determined that the network connection was healthy and the app was connected to Exchange, but the bolded portion indicates the app is not connected to Skype for Business. This could be a configuration issue on the device or host.  <br> <br> The Network status will show as either Healthy or Unhealthy. If the status is unhealthy, you may have a network issue or the device may have been unplugged (but then you would probably also have Exchange and Microsoft Teams or Skype for Business errors).  <br><br> The Exchange Status will show as either Connected or one of the following: Disconnected, Connecting, AutodiscoveryError (the most commonly seen error), GeneralError, or ServerVersionNotSupported. If the status is Connecting, wait until the next health message is sent, for other errors refer the issue to an admin with experience in solving Exchange issues.  <br><br>  The Signin status (indicating the app is signed in to Skype for Business) will show as either Healthy or Unhealthy. If the status is unhealthy, send a technician to investigate further. |
| 3000  <br> Information | This event verifies that a hardware check was run and found to be healthy. Every 5 minutes Microsoft Teams Rooms checks that configured hardware components such as front of room display, microphone, speaker, and camera are connected and functioning. If all components are healthy, it will write EventID 3000 into the event log. This event will continue to be written every 5 minutes unless there is an issue with a connected device.  <br> | {"Description":"HardwareCheckEngine is healthy.",  "ResourceState":"Healthy", "OperationName":"HardwareCheckEngine",  "OperationResult":"Pass", "OS":"Windows 10",  "OSVersion":"10.0.14393.693", "Alias":"alias<span></span>@contoso.com", "DisplayName":"Display Name", "AppVersion":"1.0.38.0",  "IPv4Address":"10.10.10.10", "IPv6Address":"ip v6 address"}  <br><br> In this example, all hardware checks were passed. If there were errors,   the app would record Event ID 3001 instead. |
| 3001  <br> Error Event  | This is a hardware error event. The Microsoft Teams Rooms app has a process that will check the health of connected hardware components (front of room, microphone, speaker, camera) every 5 minutes. If one or more of the components are unhealthy, it will write EventID 3001 into the event log. This event will continue to be written every 5 minutes until the issue with the device is fixed.   | {"Description":" **Front of Room Display status : Unhealthy.** Configured display count is 2. Real display count is 0. **Conference Microphone status : Unhealthy.** Conference Speaker status : Healthy. Default Speaker status : Healthy. Camera status : Healthy.", "ResourceState":"Unhealthy", "OperationName":"HardwareCheckEngine", "OperationResult":"Fail", "OS":"Windows 10", "OSVersion":"10.0.14393.1198", "Alias":"alias<span></span>@contoso.com", "DisplayName":"Yosemite conference room", "AppVersion":"2.0.58.0", "IPv4Address":"10.10.10.10", "IPv6Address":"IPv6Address", "IPv4Address2":"10.10.10.10"} <br><br>  Hardware peripherals are shown as either Healthy or Unhealthy. <br> In this example, there are two front of room displays configured, and currently neither of them is available. The Conference Microphone status is unhealthy, which could have a number of possible causes. Since at least one resource did not pass the check, the ResourceState is listed as Unhealthy. Send a technician to investigate further. |
| 4000  <br> Information  <br> | This is an App Restart event. Every time the app is restarted, it will log this event into the Windows event log.  <br> | {"Description":"App restarts.", "ResourceState":"Healthy", "OperationName":"Restart", "OperationResult":"Pass", "OS":"Windows 10", "OSVersion":"10.0.14393.693", "Alias":"alias<span></span>@domain.com", "DisplayName":"Display Name", "AppVersion":"1.0.38.0", "IPv4Address":"10.10.10.10", "IPv6Address":"ip v6 address"} <br><br> The app may restart for a variety of reasons. compare the restart frequency of devices in the same building and in different buildings, keeping in mind known issues like power fluctuations and failures, as this may provide clues to infrastructure problems.|
