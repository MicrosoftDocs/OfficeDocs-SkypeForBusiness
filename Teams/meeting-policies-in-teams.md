## Participants & guests
   - **Allow anonymous users to dial-out** If you want meeting participants to dial-out to add someone else, you can turn this on. If you turn it off, none of the meeting participants can dial out from the meeting.
   - **Allow anonymous users to start meetings** If this setting is off, then only someone that has been authenticated to the meeting with a Teams app can start the meeting. If it's on, then anyone can start the meeting.
   - **Automatically admit users** If you turn this off, then meeting participants will be left in the lobby until someone starts the meeting. If it's on, meeting participants will be allowed to automatically join the meeting.
