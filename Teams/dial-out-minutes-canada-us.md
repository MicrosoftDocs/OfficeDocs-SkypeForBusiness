# Office 365 Audio Conferencing Extended Dial-out Minutes to US and Canada

For customers who are adopting our Audio Conferencing service and have a high business need for dialing out to US and Canada, Microsoft now provides an add-on offer that allows virtually unlimited with fair use policy US and Canada dial-out minutes for any audio conferencing user. Meeting organizers with this add-on SKU can make virtually unlimited with fair use policy dial-out calls to US and Canada without deducting their tenant’s Zone A country dial-out usage pool or Communications Credits. <sup>1</sup>

|Offer Name | Unlimited dial-out minutes to US Canada |
|-----|------|
| What are the unlimited dial-out countries included in the offer?| US and Canada.|
| Who needs to have the license assigned? | The meeting organizer needs to have the license assigned. The user initializing the call doesn’t need to have the license. |
| Are there any prerequisites? | Audio Conferencing needs to be enabled. It can be either subscription or per-minute service.|
| Who can purchase this offer? | Any country or region where Audio Conferencing can be purchased. [Read more](country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md).|
| Are the minutes pooled?  |No. A meeting organizer will have virtually unlimited with fair use policy dial-out minutes to US/Canada per month. |
| Will this new add-on SKU replace the 60 minutes included with Audio Conferencing? | No. The existing Audio Conferencing 60 minutes per user per month, pooled at the tenant level, will continue to apply to all Zone A dial-out conferencing countries.|
| What is the channel availability?  | It is available on EA/EAS, EES, CSP, and Web Direct.  |
| What is the segment availability? | It is available for Commercial (including WW Commercial Public Sectors), Education, Nonprofit, and US GCC |
| What if a user with Extended Dial-out Minutes to USA/CAN is located in the US and travels to another country outside of an Audio-Conferencing sell-to market? Will their dial-out service work? | Yes. If a user based in the US (meaning their Office 365 license is assigned in the US) traveled to Zimbabwe (a market currently not in a sell-to location for Audio Conferencing), all dial-out minutes made to the US or Canada would continue to apply to their Extended Dial-out Minutes to USA/CAN add-on regardless of where the call takes place. |
