# Office 365 Audio Conferencing Extended Dial-out Minutes to US and Canada

For customers adopting our Audio Conferencing service and have a high business need for dialing out to US and Canada, Microsoft now provides an add-on offer. The add-on allows virtually unlimited US and Canada dial-out minutes for any audio conferencing user, subject to a fair use policy. Meeting organizers with the add-on can make virtually unlimited with fair use policy dial-out calls to US and Canada. These calls don't deduct from their tenant’s Zone A country/region dial-out usage pool or Communications Credits. <sup>1</sup>

|Offer Name | Unlimited dial-out minutes to US Canada |
|-----|------|
| What are the unlimited dial-out countries/regions included in the offer?| US and Canada.|
| Who needs to have the license assigned? | The meeting organizer needs to have the license assigned. The user initializing the call doesn’t need to have the license. |
| Are there any prerequisites? | Audio Conferencing needs to be enabled. It can be either subscription or per-minute service.|
| Who can purchase this offer? | Any country/ region where Audio Conferencing can be purchased. [Read more](country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md).|
| Are the minutes pooled?  |No. A meeting organizer has virtually unlimited with fair use policy dial-out minutes to US/Canada per month. |
| Does the new add-on replace the 60 minutes included with Audio Conferencing? | No. The existing Audio Conferencing 60 minutes per user per month, pooled at the tenant level, continue to apply to all Zone A dial-out conferencing countries/regions.|
| What is the channel availability?  | It's available on EA/EAS, EES, CSP, and Web Direct.  |
| What is the segment availability? | It's available for Commercial (including WW Commercial Public Sectors), Education, Nonprofit, and US GCC |
| What if a user with Extended Dial-out Minutes to USA/CAN is located in the US and travels to another country/region outside of an Audio-Conferencing sell-to market? Will their dial-out service work? | Yes. If a user based in the US, meaning their Office 365 license is assigned in the US, traveled to Zimbabwe, a market currently not in a sell-to location for Audio Conferencing, all dial-out minutes made to the US or Canada would continue to apply to their Extended Dial-out Minutes to USA/CAN add-on regardless of where the call takes place. |
