Define and document your Phone System with Calling Plans in Teams test plan for enterprises 
============================================================================================

After you’ve defined and documented your Phone System with Calling Plans in
Teams business success and technical implementation plans as part of the
Envision phase, the next step is validating that your organization’s
expectations and requirements are met through feature, functionality, and
usability. You should perform this validation step before you deploy a pilot or
final deployment in your production environment.

You can leverage the business success plan you defined during the Envision phase
to serve as the basis for determining the activities, expectations,
feature/functionality test cases, and overall scope to be evaluated during the
testing phase.

Identify testing support stakeholders
-------------------------------------

As you prepare to evaluate Phone System with Calling Plans features, create a
testing support stakeholder matrix to identify roles required to support the
testing phase.

> [!TIP]
> As you populate the Teams testing support stakeholder matrix, you might see
> that some roles are the same as those identified during the Envision phase,
> but with role descriptions slanted toward testing. You might need to
> identify additional roles, depending on the unique requirements of your
> testing scenarios.

#### Teams Testing Support Stakeholder Matrix

> [!TIP]

Define Phone System with Calling Plans feature requirements 
------------------------------------------------------------

As part of defining Phone System with Calling Plans feature requirements for
users in scope, one of the first steps that you should have completed during the
Envision phase was the [Persona
Analysis](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/phone-system-with-calling-plans#assess-environment-and-evaluate-adoption-readiness),
where you defined your Phone System with Calling Plans persona and scenarios.
With this baseline identified, the next step is to evaluate the latest Teams
public roadmap to determine:

-   Which Phone System with Calling Plans features you’ll deploy for users in
    scope.

-   Expected user Phone System with Calling Plans functionality requirements,
    given your current Skype for Business, Exchange, and SharePoint deployment
    landscape.

-   Whether you can confirm that Phone System with Calling Plans features
    described in the latest public roadmap meet your user, functionality, and
    scope requirements in the timeline of your deployment

> [!TIP]
> The latest Teams roadmap for identifying Phone System with Calling Plans
> features in scope for your deployment can be found at
> <https://aka.ms/skype2teamsroadmap>.

Now that the Phone System with Calling Plans persona and features have been
defined, the next criteria for evaluation will be the interoperability
experience with Teams. For additional information about the interoperability
experience along with configuration options available, see [Microsoft Teams and
Skype for Business
interoperability](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-and-skypeforbusiness-coexistence-and-interoperability).

Define and document your Phone System with Calling Plans test plan
------------------------------------------------------------------

After you’ve defined the Phone System with Calling Plans features in scope, the
next step is to create the test plan. At a high level, the test plan encompasses
the overall testing strategy and methodology you’ll use to support the feature
validation in the testing process.

At a high level, the test plan should include:

-   **Testing scope:** Summarizes the focus areas (goals, scenarios, and
    objectives) to be evaluated as part of the testing phase

-   **Test cases:** The set of test cases to be validated for Phone System with
    Calling Plans features in scope

-   **Testing resources:** A matrix of resources required to support the testing
    effort from an environmental, technical, and personnel point of view

-   **Testing schedule (timeline):** Represents when testing will begin, how
    long it’s likely to last, and when you expect the testing phase to end

-   **Defect reporting and remediation:** Guidelines for how issues with testing
    should be reported, tracked, and triaged

-   **Defect triage and escalation:** Outline for how and when a defect
    escalation should be initiated

-   **Testing exit and suspension criteria:** Guidance outlining criteria for
    either achieving sign-off to exit the testing phase or pausing testing until
    prioritized defects are resolved

-   **Test deliverables:** Summary of which outcomes will be developed and
    delivered to support sign-off acceptance and exit of the testing process

> [!TIP]
>   A testing methodology might already exist in your organization, but the
>   guidance below reflects best practices that can be included or leveraged
>   separately for testing Teams features in your environment.

In the sections that follow you’ll find additional prescribed guidance that will
assist in specific decisions, and templates and topics for you to consider as
you complete your testing plan.

### Define and document testing scope

As you work to develop your test plan, you must define the testing scope up
front, highlighting the workload and list of features that you’re evaluating.

The scope for properly evaluating Phone System with Calling Plans features
typically includes:

-   Phone System with Calling Plans site readiness

-   Phone System with Calling Plans user experience

### Define and document Phone System with Calling Plans test cases

After you’ve defined the Phone System with Calling Plans features, client
deployment, and side-by-side scenarios with Skype for Business (if applicable),
the next step is to formulate the test cases required to evaluate Phone System
with Calling Plans features in scope. At a high level, test cases typically are
grouped by focus area and include:

-   **Test case title:** Focus area of the feature the test is evaluating (for
    example, Phone System with Calling Plans)

-   **Test case description:** Summary outlining the goals of the test features
    being evaluated

-   **Test case instructions:** Steps to follow to properly execute the test
    case being performed

### Define and document testing resources

To support the testing phase, it’s important that you develop a resource plan
detailing the people, support, and technology resources that you’ll require. An
important component of the overall test plan, the resource plan helps you
determine any dependencies that might exist and gives you a high-level sense of
the resource support you might need.

At a high level, these resources typically consist of:

-   **People**: Stakeholders

-   **Technology**: Tenant, licensing, devices

-   **Support**: Training (cards, videos), administration support with defined
    escalation path

#### Testing resource requirements

> [!TIP]
>   Below is an example of testing resource requirement template that you can
>   use to document the different types of resources required to support your
>   testing phase.

</table>


### Define and document a testing timeline

As part of the test plan definition, create a timeline that outlines the
schedule for when you expect to complete testing activities and achieve
high-level milestones.

At a high level, this typically consists of:

-   **Task:** High-level activity to be completed

-   **Milestone:** High-level goal, or progress that was completed

-   **Resource required:** Testing resources required to support delivery of the
    milestone or task identified

-   **Start date:** The date the activity, milestone, or task was initiated on

-   **Completion date:** The date you expect the activity, milestone, or task to
    be completed by

-   **Owner:** Assigned resource who’s responsible for ensuring that the
    activity, milestone, or task is completed on time, in accordance with the
    completion date

-   **Estimation:** Number of hours that the assigned resources anticipate it
    will take to ensure that the activity, milestone, or task is completed on
    time

#### Testing scheduling and timeline requirements

> [!TIP]
>   Below is an example of a testing timeline requirement template that you can

### Define and document test defect report criteria

As test cases within a given phase or stream are executed, issues might arise
where the result from the test case being executed isn’t what you expected.

When these types of results occur, they should be captured in a defect report
and remediation plan that’s escalated to the designated test lead for review,
reporting, and defect resolution.

Typically, a defect report and remediation plan includes the following:

-   **Defect ID:** The number assigned to the issue

-   **Test case ID impacted**: The number assigned to the test case that was
    being evaluated at the time the defect was identified

-   **Defect description:** Summary of the issue

-   **Environment/steps to reproduce:** Summary of the testing environment
    setup, along with the exact steps required to reproduce the issue

-   **Defect severity**: The impact of the issue, ranging from preventing the
    test case from being approved to its being accepted with minimal risk. Some
    examples might include:

-   **Low:** The issue has little impact and won’t prevent the test case from
    achieving acceptance if the issue can be resolved later.

-   **Medium:** The issue has substantial impact, but won’t prevent the test
    case from achieving acceptance if the issue can be resolved before the
    testing phase is completed.

-   **High:** -The issue has critical impact on the test case. The issue must be
    resolved before the test case can be accepted.

-   **Status:** Has the issue been resolved, is it open, or still under
    investigation

-   **Submitted by:** The tester who reported the issue

-   **Assigned owner:** The resource assigned from the testing team who is
    responsible for resolving the issue

-   **Supporting details:** This can include—but isn’t limited to—client-side
    logs, screenshots, or video of the issue.

As testers execute the test cases outlined in your test plan, they should be
sure to complete a defect report and remediation plan for any issues that arise.
This will highlight potential impact that could impede or even halt the testing
evaluation process.

#### Testing defect report and remediation plan

> [!TIP]
>   Below is an example of Defect Report and Remediation Plan template that you
>   can use to document issues discovered during the testing phase.

### Define and document exit and suspension criteria

As part of the overall test plan execution process, you need to define criteria
to indicate the point at which you should suspend testing efforts versus
requirements that must be met for obtaining sign-off and exiting the testing
phase.

#### Test plan exit and suspension criteria

> [!TIP]
>   Below is an example of exit and suspension criteria template that you can
>   use in your test plan to document criteria required to achieve sign-off,
>   exit the testing phase, or suspend testing activities.

| Testing exit criteria                            | Testing suspension criteria                      |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
|<ul><li>All test cases must achieve a pass rate of TBD %</li><li>All test cases must have been completely executed</li><li>From all test cases evaluated, all High severity defects must be closed</li></ul> | <ul><li>All test cases must achieve a TBD % failure rate</li><li>All defects identified as High severity must be resolved before testing can continue.</li></ul> |


<table>
<tr><td><img src="media/audio_conferencing_image7.png" alt=""/> <br/>Decision points</td><td><ul><li>Decide on suspension criteria that must be met if issues with testing are identified.</li><li>Decide on exit criteria that must be met to obtain testing acceptance sign-off and support exiting the testing phase after all testing activities are complete.</li></ul></td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="media/audio_conferencing_image9.png" alt=""/><br/>Next steps</td><td><ul><li>Document the testing exit and suspension criteria required in the test and exit templates provided.</li></ul></td></tr>
</table>


### Define and document the defect escalation process

Throughout the course of test plan execution, you might discover an issue or
identify a defect that requires escalation to the right resource for driving and
determining the required resolution to allow testing to proceed.

As defects are identified with the appropriate severity and priority assigned,
you create an escalation matrix and triage review process for mapping out when
an escalation is triggered and how, when, and who the defect will be assigned to
for further review and resolution.

Typically, a defect report and remediation plan includes the following:

-   **Defect ID:** The number you assigned to the issue

-   **Defect description:** Summary of the issue

-   **Defect priority assessment:** The level of priority assigned to a defect
    for resolution based on business impact and defect severity. Some examples
    could include:

-   **Low:** The issue has little impact on preventing the testing phase from
    achieving sign-off if the issue can be resolved later.

-   **Medium:** The issue has substantial impact on preventing the testing phase
    from achieving sign-off if the issue can’t be resolved.

-   **High:** The issue has critical impact on preventing the testing phase from
    achieving sign-off if the issue can’t be resolved.

-   **Assigned defect owner:** The resource assigned from the testing team who’s
    responsible for resolving the issue

-   **Assigned defect escalation point:** The resource assigned who is on point
    for escalating the issue in the organization (if required) for driving
    resolution; based on defect severity

-   **Defect status:** Has the issue been resolved, is it open, or still under
    investigation

-   **Required resolution by date:** The date which the issue must be resolved
    by

-   **Status date:** The date reflecting the last time status was updated as an
    outcome of a defect triage review

#### Test plan defect escalation

### Define and document testing deliverables

The last and final component in creating a test plan is to identify the outcomes
in terms of specific deliverables that the overall test plan will deliver.

At a high level, these typically include, but aren’t limited to:

-   Test plan

-   Test cases

-   Defect reports

-   Test results summary

-   Test acceptance and sign-off

#### Test plan deliverables

Evaluate network readiness
----------------------------

As a critical element supporting your Teams deployment, network readiness is a
crucial part of testing to ensure that the network is properly optimized for
supporting Teams communications. To ensure that your network is ready for the
sites in scope, include the focus areas listed below in your overall testing
strategy:

-   Bandwidth estimation and planning with Network Planner (via MyAdvisor)

-   Quality of service (QoS) configuration validation

-   Network connectivity and performance check through traffic simulation

-   Split-tunneling validation

### Execute Network Planner (through MyAdvisor) for sites and personas in scope

Before introducing real-time communication services like Teams in your
environment, it’s important to ensure that the network has been properly
optimized and sized from an Azure ExpressRoute (if applicable), internet, and
WAN bandwidth perspective.

Evaluate QoS configuration for sites in scope
---------------------------------------------

As part of validating network readiness for supporting Teams real-time
communications, it’s equally important to ensure that the network has been
properly configured and optimized from a QoS perspective.

For additional guidance on how to configure, deploy, and validate QoS network
readiness for Teams by using Group Policy, see [Enabling QoS for
Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/qos-in-teams).

Execute split-tunnel enablement validation
------------------------------------------

It’s common for businesses today to have one or more solutions for providing
remote access, such as a virtual private network, or VPN. These solutions enable
connectivity to internal line-of-business assets and applications securely and
reliably.

Though remote access solutions can work very well for giving access to some
applications, when it comes to tunneling Teams real-time media traffic, these
solutions frequently result in a less-than-optimal user experience for all
participants in a Teams audio conferencing or calling scenario.

To ensure that Teams media traffic does *not* traverse remote access solutions
in your environment, a split-tunnel configuration will be required.

For additional guidance on how to configure and validate split-tunnel
configuration network readiness for Teams, see
[Network](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/prepare-network)
Readiness.

> [!NOTE]
>   Due to the sheer volume of remote access solutions available in the
>   marketplace, this document can’t provide vendor-specific details, just
>   general guidelines for what should be configured on remote access solutions.

Execute network connectivity and performance validation by using the Network Assessment tool from Microsoft
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Network Assessment tool from Microsoft performs traffic simulation and
connectivity tests by streaming simulated audio packets, for a predefined period
and number of iterations, to the nearest edge site that provides connectivity to
the Teams service. One goal of this test is to evaluate network performance
metrics for packet loss, jitter, round-trip latency, and packet reorder
percentage from each simulated call. In addition, the test validates that proper
connectivity is allowed between internal and edge network elements to all edge
ingress points that support connectivity to Teams services.

For additional guidance on how to confirm and evaluate Teams network readiness
for designated sites in scope, see
[Network](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/prepare-network)
Readiness.

Execute subscriber number port validation
-----------------------------------------

If you’ll need to transfer numbers as part of providing inbound/outbound calling
capabilities in Phone System with Calling Plans services supported by Teams, you
should perform a partial port for a service number. This will help you validate
the expectations, requirements, and reasonable timeline as you finish preparing
your deployment of Phone System with Calling Plans services in your production
environment.

To complete a partial port of a subscriber number from your current PSTN service
provider to Teams, walk through the steps described below.

#### Step 1

Identify the test number that you would like to port to Office 365 as an
assignable user number (subscriber number) to be serviced via the Phone System
with Calling Plans service in Teams.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>As you plan your number porting test, be sure to review the latest guidelines for number porting requests in [Number Port Common Questions](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/transferring-phone-numbers-common-questions).

#### Step 2

Identify and document all account information (including the name used for the
specific account) for the current carrier of the test number you’ll be porting.
Typically, you can find the information you’ll need in the most recent bill or
invoice from your current service provider.

> [!TIP]
>   You can port or transfer phone numbers within all currently supported
>   countries/regions; however, the way you submit a port order request might
>   differ depending on the country/region where the phone numbers are sourced
>   from. For the latest list of currently supported countries/regions, see
>   [Countries and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling
>   Plans](country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md).
> 
>   For additional information about transferring phone numbers to Phone System
>   with Calling Plans—along with potential restrictions—see [Transfer phone
>   numbers to Office
>   365](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/transfer-phone-numbers-to-office-365)
>   and [Toll Free dialing restrictions within Office
>   365](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/toll-free-dialing-limitations-and-restrictions.).

#### Step 3

Download and create a Letter of Authorization (LOA) for your country/region
that’s based on “service Number” as the number porting type.

>[!NOTE]
>   Because LOA formats can differ by country, region, or number type (that is
>   geographic versus non-geographic or user number versus service or toll-free
>   number), verify that you’re using the correct LOA template for your specific
>   scenario type. See [Download a Letter of Authorization
>   (LOA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/download-a-letter-of-authorization-loa)
>   for more information about choosing the LOA, or go directly to the [download
>   page](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49167).

>[!NOTE]
> **United States only**<br/>
>   Because we’re only porting one service number for this test, be sure to
>   select the appropriate fields in the LOA as shown below:

![How many phone numbers will you be transferring? Answer: I am only transferring some of my numbers from my current carrier.](media/onboarding-test-plan-image1.png "How many phone numbers will you be transferring? Answer: I am only transferring some of my numbers from my current carrier.")

![What kind of phone numbers will you be transferring? Answer: I am transferring voice service phone numbers like for auto attendants or conference bridges.](media/onboarding-test-plan-image2.png "What kind of phone numbers will you be transferring? Answer: I am transferring voice service phone numbers like for auto attendants or conference bridges.")

>[!IMPORTANT]
>   When you manually port phone numbers by using an LOA, make sure you select
>   the correct type of phone number. You must submit separate port orders for
>   each type of phone number you want to transfer.<br/><br/>
>   Because we want to test the number porting process by using a phone number
>   associated with the same billing telephone number (BTN), you need to ensure
>   that the billing telephone number is *not* included with the specific phone
>   number being ported.

#### Step 4

In the tenant admin portal, go to the **Support** tab and create and submit a
service request. Attach the completed LOA file to schedule the phone number
associated with your current service provider for migration. To choose the
service request method most appropriate for your tenant size, see [Manually
submit a custom service
request](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/manually-submit-a-custom-service-request).

After the support request is received, Microsoft Support will follow up based on
the communication method you’ve chosen and advise you of status and next steps
for completing the number porting process.

#### Step 5

After the number is confirmed as having been ported over as a new subscriber
number in Office 365, assign the number to the Phone System with Calling Plans
service by going to the tenant admin portal \> **Skype for Business Admin
Center** \> **Voice**. On the **Phone Numbers** tab, assign the new service
number to the Phone System with Calling Plans service.

> [!TIP]
>   Though this task assigns a new service number to Phone System with Calling
>   Plans, at the time of this writing, the administration for this task is
>   completed by using the Skype for Business admin center.

#### Step 6

Now that you’ve assigned the ported subscriber number, sign in to a Teams client
as the user and dial an external 10-digit number via the PSTN. After you place
the call, confirm that the call has been connected and that the displayed caller
ID matches the subscriber number you ported.

#### Step 7

From an external PSTN number, place a call to the subscriber number you ported
to Office 365 and verify that the call is received inbound and connected via the
Teams client.
