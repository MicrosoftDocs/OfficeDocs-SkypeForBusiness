Microsoft Teams guest access checklist
=========================================

Use this checklist to help you turn on and configure guest access in Microsoft Teams. You need to be a Global Administrator or a Teams Administrator to make these changes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You may have to wait a few hours for your changes to take effect. 

Watch this short video (5:31 minutes) to see how to turn on guest access throughout Microsoft 365, including Teams.

## Step 1: Turn on guest access at the Teams org-wide level

To turn on guest access, go to the admin center at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">https://admin.microsoft.com</a>. 

1. In the Teams admin center, select **Org-Wide settings** > **Guest access**.
2. Set the **Allow guest access in Microsoft Teams** switch to **On**.

    ![Screenshot shows an example of a Teams settings toggle](media/guest-access-checklist-set-up-guests-image1.png)

3. On this same page, turn on or turn off **Calling**, **Meeting**, and **Messaging** settings for guests.
4. Click **Save**.

> [!TIP]
> If you're using default settings in Azure Active Directory, SharePoint Online, and Microsoft 365 Groups, you may be done configuring guest access. In this case, you can skip the rest of the steps. If you're not sure, or if you're using custom settings for AAD, SharePoint Online, or Microsoft 365 Groups, continue with the rest of the steps in this checklist.

## Step 2: Configure Azure AD business-to-business settings

These are the Azure AD settings that support guest access in Teams. Once these settings are configured, you'll be able to [add](add-guests.md) and [manage guests](manage-guests.md) in Teams.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as a tenant administrator.
2. Select **Azure Active Directory** > **Users** > **User settings**.
3. Under **External users**, select **Manage external collaboration settings**.
   > [!NOTE]
   > The **External collaboration settings** are also available from the **Organizational relationships** page. In Azure Active Directory, under **Manage**, go to **Organizational relationships** > **Settings**.
4. On the **External collaboration settings** page, choose the policies you want to enable.

    - **Guest users permissions are limited**: This policy determines permissions for guests in your directory. Select **Yes** to block guests from certain directory tasks, like enumerating users, groups, or other directory resources. Select **No** to give guests the same access to directory data as  regular users in your directory.
     - **Admins and users in the guest inviter role can invite**: To allow admins and users in the "Guest Inviter" role to invite guests, set this policy to **Yes**.
     - **Members can invite**: To allow non-admin members of your directory to invite guests, set this policy to **Yes** (recommended). If you prefer that only admins be able to add guests, you can set this policy to **No**. Keep in mind that setting **No** will limit the guest experience for non-admin teams owners; they'll only be able to add guests in Teams that have already been added in AAD by the admin.
     - **Guests can invite**: To allow guests to invite other guests, set this policy to **Yes**.
         > [!IMPORTANT]
         > Currently, Teams doesn't support the guest inviter role, so even if you set **Guests can invite** to **Yes**, guests can't invite other guests in Teams.
     - **Enable email one-time passcode for guests (Preview)**: For more information about the one-time passcode feature, see [Email one-time passcode authentication (preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/one-time-passcode).
     - **Collaboration restrictions**: For more information about allowing or blocking invitations to specific domains, see [Allow or block invitations to B2B users from specific organizations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/allow-deny-list).
        > [!NOTE]
        > For collaboration restrictions, see [Enable B2B external collaboration and manage who can invite guests](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/delegate-invitations).
      
    For more information about controlling who can invite guests, see [Delegate invitations for Azure Active Directory B2B collaboration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/delegate-invitations).

## Step 3: Configure Microsoft 365 Groups

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Settings** > **Settings**, click **Services**, and then select **Microsoft 365 Groups**.

     ![Screenshot shows the Microsoft 365 Groups settings](media/guest-access-checklist-services-settings.png)
2. Make sure that the **Let group members outside the organization access group content** check box is selected. If this setting is not selected, guests won't be able to access any group content.

    ![Screenshot shows the Microsoft 365 Groups settings](media/guest-access-checklist-office365.png)
3. Make sure that the **Let group owners add people outside the organization to groups** check box is selected. If this setting is not selected, team owners won't be able to add new guests. At a minimum, this setting must be on to support guest access.

For detailed instructions about configuring these settings, see [Manage guest access in Microsoft 365 Groups](https://support.office.com/article/manage-guest-access-in-office-365-groups-9de497a9-2f5c-43d6-ae18-767f2e6fe6e0?appver=MOE150) and [Control guest access in Microsoft 365 Groups](Teams-dependencies.md#control-guest-access-in-microsoft-365-groups).

## Step 4: Configure sharing in Microsoft 365 

Make sure that users can add guests. Here's how:

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Settings** > **Settings**, click **Security & privacy**, and then select **Sharing**.

     ![Screenshot shows an example of services settings](media/guest-access-checklist-security-privacy-settings.png)
 
2. Select the **Let users add new guests to this organization** check box, and then click **Save changes**.

     ![Screenshot shows an example of a sharing settings toggle](media/guest-access-checklist-sharing-setting.png)
 
    > [!NOTE]
    > This setting is equivalent to the **Members can invite** setting in **User settings** > **External users** in Azure AD.  

## Step 5: Verify sharing setting in SharePoint

1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center.
2. Under **Admin centers**, select  **SharePoint**.
3. In the new SharePoint admin center,  under **Sites**, select **Active sites**.

    ![Active sites in the SharePoint admin center](media/guest-access-checklist-SPOSettings0.png)

3. Select the site, and then click **Sharing**.
4. Make sure that the option is set to **Anyone**, **New and existing guests**, or **Existing guests**.

     ![Screenshot shows an example of a SharePoint Online settings toggle](media/guest-access-checklist-SPOSettings1.png)

## Step 6: Set up guest user permissions

In the Teams application, at the individual team level, configure guest permissions that control whether guests can create, update, or delete channels. Teams admins as well as team owners can configure these settings.
