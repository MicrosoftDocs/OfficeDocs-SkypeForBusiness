# IP Relay in Canada - user guide

[!INCLUDE [sfbo-retirement](../Skype/Hub/includes/sfbo-retirement.md)]

## Scenario A
  
If a hearing- or voice-impaired person wishes to contact a nonimpaired individual, they “chat” via a special web-based client to an agent called a Call Taker.

The Call Taker then communicates with the hearing- or voice-impaired person through the chat session, and contacts the nonimpaired person through the telephone network anywhere in Canada or the United States, as required.

## Scenario B

If a nonimpaired person wishes to talk to a registered hearing- or voice-impaired user, they call the toll-free number as provided by Microsoft.

The Call Taker then communicates with the nonimpaired person and contacts the hearing- or voice-impaired person via chat and communicates back and forth.

If the hearing- or voice-impaired person is not online in the chat program, and an email address is available, the Call Taker sends an email to the hearing- or voice-impaired person, if requested by the caller.

## Scenario C

If a hearing- or voice-impaired person requires emergency assistance, the person may select the appropriate button: 911 – Police / 911 – Fire / 911 – Ambulance.

Selecting the button sends an emergency notification to the Northern IP Relay operators, who then access the 911 account designed for this purpose. Once the Call Taker confirms the address, they'll contact the appropriate PSAP and stay on the line for as long as required.

## How to place a Text chat to Voice call

### How to make a Text to Voice call

1. In the lower-right corner of screen, select Chat.
2. Select the IPRelay user.
3. In the bottom of the new box that pops up, type your message.

### How to receive a Voice to Text call

- Voice users need to know your IP Message Relay Username in order to place a voice to text call.

- Voice users can call (866) 660-8613 to connect with an IP Message Relay operator.

- You must be logged in to the IP Message Relay portal to receive calls or chats.

### How to place a 911 call

If you experience an emergency, you may select the appropriate emergency button located at the bottom of your screen: 911 – Police / 911 – Fire / 911 – Ambulance

The IP Message Relay Operator contacts 911, confirms your address, and translates with various emergency centers until the operator is no longer required, and the appropriate department is dispatched to your location.

> [!Warning]
> Please do not test this service, as the appropriate agency will be contacted and possibly dispatched even if you indicate it is simply a test, and you may be charged a false dispatch fee from the emergency agency.

## Customer Support
