# IP Relay in Canada - user guide

[!INCLUDE [sfbo-retirement](../Skype/Hub/includes/sfbo-retirement.md)]

## Scenario A
  
If a hearing- or voice-impaired person wishes to contact a non-impaired individual, they “chat” via a special web-based client to an agent called a Call Taker.

The Call Taker then communicates with the hearing- or voice-impaired person via the chat session and contacts the non-impaired person through the telephone network anywhere in Canada or the United States, as required.

## Scenario B

If a non-impaired person wishes to talk to a registered hearing- or voice-impaired user, they call the toll-free number as provided by Microsoft.

The Call Taker then communicates with the non-impaired person and contacts the hearing- or voice-impaired person via chat and communicates back and forth.

Should the hearing- or voice-impaired person not be online in the chat program, if an email address is available the Call Taker will send an email to the hearing- or voice-impaired person, if requested by the caller.

## Scenario C

If a hearing- or voice-impaired person requires emergency assistance, he or she may select the appropriate button: 911 – Police / 911 – Fire / 911 – Ambulance.

This will send an emergency notification to the Northern IP Relay operators, who will then access the 911 account designed for this purpose. Once the Call Taker has confirmed his or her address, they will contact the appropriate PSAP and stay on the line for as long as required.
