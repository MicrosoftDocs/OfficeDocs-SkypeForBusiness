# New Teams system requirements

Microsoft Teams can be installed on PCs, Macs, and mobile devices, and can also be accessed via a web browser. Most end users can start using Teams by [installing the client](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app). After they install the new Teams client, all they need to do is sign in with their username and password.

The new Teams client delivers up toâ€¯two times faster app performance while using 50% less memory with the same system requirements that classic Teams has.

## New Teams for web

New Teams for Web shares the same hardware requirements as the underlying operating system (Windows, macOS, and Linux) and is supported on the following desktop browsers:

|Browser        |Supported versions    |Operating systems     |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|
|Microsoft Edge |Latest three versions |Windows, macOS, Linux |
|Chrome         |Latest three versions |Windows, macOS, Linux |
|Firefox        |Latest three versions |Windows, macOS, Linux |
|Safari         |Latest two versions   |macOS                 |

The browser must be configured to allow third-party cookies for some third-party or line-of-business (LOB) apps to function properly.

>[!Note]
>New Teams for Web isn't supported in VDI environments, so performance and reliability may be negatively impacted if used in VDI. New Teams for Web isn't supported on mobile browsers.

## New Teams on Linux

Linux users have access to New Teams for Web and new Teams as a progressive web app (PWA).

## New Teams in a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environment

See [Upgrade to New Teams for Virtualized Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)](new-teams-vdi-requirements-deploy.md) for the requirements for running new Teams in a virtualized environment.

## Teams for mobile devices

You can continue using Teams on these mobile platforms:

- Android: Compatible with Android phones and tablets.

Support is limited to the last four major versions of Android. For example, when a new, major version of Android is released, the Android requirement is the new version and the three most recent versions that precede it.

- iOS: Compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.

Support is limited to the two most recent major versions of iOS. For example, when a new, major version of iOS is released, the iOS requirement is the new version and the most recent version that preceded it.

## Additional user scenario hardware recommendations

While you can use new Teams with the previously mentioned minimal hardware requirements, we recommend the following hardware system requirements for Teams user scenarios like Avatar, Teams Live Events, and so on.

|Teams user scenario               |Hardware systems requirements (equivalent or higher)              |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Avatar/Mesh experience            |8 GB Ram or higher</br>Four-core processor from 2018 or higher    |
|Large meetings (10+ participants) |Four-core processor from 2018 or higher                           |
|Teams Live Events                 |Four-core processor from 2018 or higher                           |
