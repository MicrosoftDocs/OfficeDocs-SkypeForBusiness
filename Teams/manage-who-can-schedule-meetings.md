# Manage who can start instant meetings and schedule meetings

As an admin, you can restrict which users can start instant meetings and schedule meetings in Teams. This can be especially useful for privacy and security reasons, where you may not want particular users setting up meetings.

The meeting policy settings are turned on by default. These settings can be found in the Teams admin center under **Meetings** > **Meeting policies**.

- **Meet now in channels**: Controls whether a user can start an instant meeting in a channel.
- **Channel meeting scheduling**: Controls whether a user can schedule a meeting in a channel.
- **Private meeting scheduling**: Controls whether a user can schedule a private meeting in Teams. A meeting is private when it's not published to a channel in a team.
- **Outlook add in**: Controls whether a user can schedule a private meeting from Outlook. A meeting is private when it's not published to a channel in a team.
- **Meet now in private meetings**: Controls whether a user can start an instant private meeting.

> [!NOTE]
> If the meeting was sent by a delegate, who was given permissions to send meeting invitations on behalf of another person, such as a manager, the meeting policy setting is applied to the person who granted permission (the manager).

## Channel meetings

If you have compliance requirements that mandate only specific people start instant channel meetings and schedule channel meetings, then you can create or update your meeting policy to restrict these settings. You can then create a separate policy attributed to users who you want to start instant channel meetings and schedule channel meetings.

1. From the Teams admin center, go to **Meetings** > **Meeting policies** and choose the policy you want to update. To create a new policy, click **Add**.
1. Under **General**, toggle the following:
    1. If you want to restrict who can start instant meetings in a channel, toggle **Meet now in channels** to **Off**.
    1. If you want to restrict who can schedule meetings in a channel, toggle **Channel meeting scheduling** to **Off**.
1. Hit **Save** at the bottom of the page.

## Private meetings

If you have compliance requirements that mandate only specific people start instant private meetings and schedule private meetings, then you can create or update your meeting policies to restrict these settings. You can then create a separate policy attributed to users who you want to start instant meetings and schedule private meetings.

1. From the Teams admin center, go to **Meetings** > **Meeting policies** and choose the policy you want to update. To create a new policy, click **Add**.
1. Under **General**, toggle the following:
    1. If you want to restrict who can start instant private meetings, toggle **Meet now in private meetings** to **Off**.
    1. If you want to restrict who can schedule private meetings in a channel, toggle both **Private meeting scheduling** and **Outlook add-in** to **Off**.
1. Hit **Save** at the bottom of the page.

## Turning off meeting policy settings

After any of these meeting policy settings are turned off, any user assigned to the policy will not be able to start or schedule meetings of that type. The meeting join links and conference IDs of all existing meetings of that type that the user had previously started or scheduled will not work. (The conversations, files, whiteboards, recordings, transcripts, and other content related to the meeting are retained and users can still access them.)

If a meeting policy setting is turned off and then turned on again for a user, all previously scheduled meetings organized by the user become active and people can join them using the meeting join link or by phone.
