# Plan for your upgrade

![Diagram of the Teams upgrade journey](media/upgrade-banner-main.png "Ensure your project is set up for success with the right project team. Define your project scope, goals, and timeline. Confirm both technical and user readiness. Execute your rollout plan. Maintain momentum to maximize results.")

A healthy technical environment, sustained user adoption, and the realization of your business goals all begin with proper planning. A solid plan gives you a framework for your upgrade project and ensures that all stakeholders are working toward the same goals. By taking time to properly define success, you can measure results as you progress through your deployment and verify that you're achieving the outcomes you wanted. Planning your journey includes:

- [Enlisting your project stakeholders](upgrade-enlist-stakeholders.md)
- [Defining the scope of your project](./upgrade-define-project-scope.md)
- [Understanding coexistence and interoperability of Skype for Business and Teams](./teams-and-skypeforbusiness-coexistence-and-interoperability.md)
- [Choosing your upgrade journey based on your business needs](upgrade-and-coexistence-of-skypeforbusiness-and-teams.md)
- [Planning a user pilot](pilot-essentials.md)

After you've planned your journey, you will read topics about [preparing your environment](upgrade-prepare-environment.md) and [preparing your organization](upgrade-prepare-organization.md) before you [implement your upgrade](upgrade-to-teams.md).
