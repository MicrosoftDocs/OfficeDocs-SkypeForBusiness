# User feedback surveys 

Use feedback surveys to capture users’ experience and insights after your deployment. Questions should elicit feedback about the users’ receptiveness to change, the effectiveness of training resources, how ready was the support plan, and the users’ overall experience. Assess survey responses to measure against the SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, time-bound) goals you defined during your project planning, and determine any additional action required.

Customize the questions below, and then transfer them to a survey tool such as SharePoint for easy distribution and analysis.

For the purpose of these surveys, *new phone system* refers to using calling features in Microsoft Teams or Skype for Business, in addition to devices such as a media phone or mobile phone. All references to Microsoft Teams in these surveys also apply to Skype for Business.

Indicate your level of agreement with the following statements, as it relates to using Teams as your phone.
