# Move from Skype for Business Online Connector to the Teams PowerShell module

To move from using Skype for Business Online Connector to the Teams PowerShell module to manage Teams, you'll need to update your existing PowerShell scripts. This article explains how to do this.

1. Install the latest Teams PowerShell module. For steps, see [Install Microsoft Teams Powershell](teams-powershell-install.md).
2. Uninstall Skype For Business Online Connector. To do this, in Control Panel, go **Programs and Features**, select **Skype for Business Online, Windows PowerShell Module**, and then select **Uninstall**. 
3. In your PowerShell scripts, change the module name that's referenced in ```Import-Module``` from 
```SkypeOnlineConnector``` or ```LyncOnlineConnector``` to ```MicrosoftTeams```.

    For example, change ```Import-Module -Name SkypeOnlineConnector``` to ```Import-Module -Name MicrosoftTeams```.

> [!NOTE]
> Admins should continue to use [New-CsOnlineSession](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/new-csonlinesession) and [import the session before using Skype for Business Online cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/manage-skype-for-business-online-with-microsoft-365-powershell).
