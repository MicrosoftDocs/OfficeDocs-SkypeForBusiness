# Support remote workers using Microsoft Teams

Use the best practices in this article to support your users who work remotely or from home.

1.  Make sure [Teams is turned on for everyone](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/assign-teams-licenses)
    
      - Look at [Teams Exploratory](eams-exploratory.md) or [Teams free](https://support.office.com/article/Welcome-to-Microsoft-Teams-free-6d79a648-6913-4696-9237-ed13de64ae3c) to make Teams available to everybody in your company

2.  [Send out links to training](enduser-training.md) to help your employees get the most out of Teams
    
      - Don’t miss [Best practices for organizing teams](best-practices-organizing.md)

3.  Encourage everyone to [install](get-clients.md#mobile-clients) and use the mobile app

4.  Staff up your [helpdesk](troubleshoot-installation.md) to deal with user inquiries

5.  Make sure your employees have adequate internet access and bandwidth for Teams 

6.  Use Teams to stay in touch with your employees – [org-wide teams](create-an-org-wide-team.md), [Company Communicator](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates#company-communicator) app template
    
      - Send out information about your org’s work-from-home and health and safety policies
