### Known issue - China: Dialing into Skype for Business or Teams conference IDs

The following is a summary of a Feb 7, 2020 Message center post (MC203397):

Microsoft is aware that some users in the China region are experiencing issues dialing into Skype for Business or Teams conference IDs. In most cases, these problems are external to systems under our control. Often, the issue is with local mobile and telephony carriers. 

We recommend the following if you're having audio conferencing problems:

- Ask the caller or meeting organizer to call your PSTN or mobile number.
- Join the call or meeting from the desktop or mobile clients, using VoIP.

If you need to log a support ticket, please include the following:
    
- Exact time of call
- Conference bridge number dialed
- Caller phone network
- Caller phone number
