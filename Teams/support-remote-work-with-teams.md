# Support remote workers using Microsoft Teams

Use the best practices in this article to support your users who work remotely or from home.

## Technical

1.  Make sure [Teams is turned on for everyone](assign-teams-licenses.md)
    
      - Look at [Teams Exploratory](teams-exploratory.md) or [Teams free](https://support.office.com/article/Welcome-to-Microsoft-Teams-free-6d79a648-6913-4696-9237-ed13de64ae3c) to make Teams available to everybody in your company

2.  [Send out links to training](enduser-training.md) to help your employees get the most out of Teams
    
      - Read our new articles about working remotely and share them with your users:
        
        [Collaborate with Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/Collaborate-with-Office-365-ac05a41e-0b49-4420-9ebc-190ee4e744f4) article

        [Working remotely with Teams and Office 365](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4549995/working-remotely-with-teams-and-office-365)

3.  Encourage everyone to [install](get-clients.md#mobile-clients) and use the mobile app
     
     [iOS](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=835758)
     
     [Android](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2102168)
     *Note: If you're in China, go here to [Get Teams for Android in China](get-teams-android-in-china.md)*

4.  Staff up your [helpdesk](troubleshoot-installation.md) to deal with user inquiries

5.  Make sure your employees have adequate internet access and bandwidth for Teams 

## Communications

Use Teams to stay in touch with your employees:
- [Org-wide teams](create-an-org-wide-team.md) and [Company Communicator](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates#company-communicator) app template
    
- Send out information about your org’s work-from-home and health and safety policies
    
- Use [Live events](teams-live-events/what-are-teams-live-events.md) for company-wide meetings and outreach

## Personal considerations

Here are some tips for successfully working from home:

- Have a defined physical work space with good lighting and proper ergonomics.
- Set clear boundaries on your work hours and commitments, and use the Teams presence status to indicate when you're away
- “Commute” to and from your work-from-home office deliberately; don’t turn work-from-home into home-equals-work.
- Get up and take a break periodically. Go for a walk, stretch, make yourself a cup of tea.
