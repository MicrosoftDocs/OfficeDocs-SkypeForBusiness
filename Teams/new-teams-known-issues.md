# Known issues for new Microsoft Teams

- Annotations from the Presenter toolbar aren't currently available.
- PowerPoint Live Standout isn't yet available.
- Language-aware spell checking is currently not available in the new Teams. The team is focusing on this issue with a high priority. Check back for updates.
- On Windows, spell checking is limited to English (United States) dictionaries. Until this is fixed, users can disable spell checking from the settings page.
- Some spell checker suggestions for English can be inaccurate. A Windows fix is pending, with an estimated rollout date of January. Users may choose to disable spell checking from the settings page until then.
- Scheduling a Teams Live Event will redirect to the classic Teams web experience currently.
- Producing a Teams Live Event isn't currently available; you need to switch back to classic Teams.
- Setting up the Home Page in a newly created Class team in Microsoft Teams for Education isn't currently available on desktop.
- Users are unable to see the presence of other users under the Organization tab in 1:1 chats. Restart your new Teams client or browser window to resolve. Still an issue for offline contacts.

## Coming in December

- Support for NDI, SDI, and ISO streaming of Teams media content.
- Set presence in taskbar.
- Show and set presence in system tray.
- Support for external shared channels when using grid view in Microsoft Teams for Education.

## Coming in January

- Custom backgrounds for announcement posts in channels is delayed in *Teams for Education* pending the availability of policy controls.
