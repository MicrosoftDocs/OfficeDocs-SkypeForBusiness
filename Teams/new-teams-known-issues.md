# Known issues for new Microsoft Teams

- PowerPoint Live Standout isn't yet available.
- Language-aware spell checking is currently not available in the new Teams. The team is focusing on this issue with a high priority. Check back for updates.
- On Windows, spell checking is limited to English (United States) dictionaries. Until this is fixed, users can disable spell checking from the settings page.
- Some spell checker suggestions for English can be inaccurate. A Windows fix is pending, with an estimated rollout date of January. Users may choose to disable spell checking from the settings page until then.
- Scheduling a Teams Live Event will redirect to the classic Teams web experience currently.
- Producing a Teams Live Event isn't currently available; you need to switch back to classic Teams.
- Users are unable to see the presence of other users under the Organization tab in 1:1 chats. Restart your new Teams client or browser window to resolve. Still an issue for offline contacts.
- New Teams client is not respecting the date time formats set in the OS. This affects both 12h/24h time formatting as well as date formatting in the product. A fix is pending; check back for updates.
- A fix for a scenario where Sensitivity labels from the wrong template appear for class teams in the Edit Team/Create Team dialogue is expected in the end of January.
- Weekly digest mail settings are missing in Teams for Education.
- When navigating to Teams from microsoft365.com the top navigation bar is not working as expected and both search and profile menu are missing. We plan to fix this by February, in the meantime  use a taskbar shortcut or navigate directly to teams.microsoft.com to avoid the issue.
- Students are able to reply to posts by bots like the Assignment bot in the General channel even if channel moderation is enabled. A workaround is to - publish assignments in another channel where channel moderation is enabled and in channel settings you have enabled "Allow bots to submit channel messages".
- Create team from an existing team is currently not available in Teams for education.

## Coming in December

- Support for NDI, SDI, and ISO streaming of Teams media content.
- Set presence in taskbar.
- Show and set presence in system tray.
- Support for external shared channels when using grid view in Microsoft Teams for Education.
- A fix for scenarios where clicking Insights card while grading assignments in Teams for Education would result in an error.

## Coming in January

- Custom backgrounds for announcement posts in channels is delayed in *Teams for Education* pending the availability of policy controls.
