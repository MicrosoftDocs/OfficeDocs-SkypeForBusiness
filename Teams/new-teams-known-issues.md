# Known issues for new Microsoft Teams

- Annotations from the Presenter toolbar aren't currently available.
- PowerPoint Live Standout isn't yet available.
- Language-aware spell checking is currently not available in the new Teams. The team is focusing on this issue with a high priority. Check back for updates.
- On Windows, spell checking is limited to English (United States) dictionaries. Until this is fixed, users can disable spell checking from the settings page.
- Some spell checker suggestions for English can be inaccurate. A Windows fix is pending, with an estimated rollout date of January. Users may choose to disable spell checking from the settings page until then.
- Scheduling a Teams Live Event will redirect to the classic Teams web experience currently.
- Producing a Teams Live Event isn't currently available; you need to switch back to classic Teams.
- Users are unable to see the presence of other users under the Organization tab in 1:1 chats. Restart your new Teams client or browser window to resolve. Still an issue for offline contacts.
- New Teams client is not respecting the date time formats set in the OS. This affects both 12h/24h time formatting as well as date formatting in the product. A fix is pending; check back for updates.
- Support for NDI, SDI, and ISO streaming of Teams media content.
- Set presence in taskbar.
- Show and set presence in system tray.

## Issues specifically for the new **Microsoft Teams for Education**

*Please note that the issues in the first section also may affect EDU.*  
*If your issue is not in this list please file a support ticket at:* [**aka.ms/edusupport**](https://aka.ms/edusupport)  
*This page will however be frequently updated in the coming weeks, so please check back if you identify a new issue*  
*More frequent updates to the desktop clients are to be expected as issues are fixed and features added.*  

- The Edit class team dialogue shows sensitivity label, however it is not supported in class teams and a fix is expected in the end of January. 
- Weekly digest mail settings are missing
- When navigating to Teams from microsoft365.com, the top navigation bar is not working as expected and both search and profile menu are missing. The plan is to fix this by February, in the meantime use a taskbar shortcut or navigate directly to *teams.microsoft.com* to avoid the issue.
- Students are able to reply to posts by bots like the Assignment bot in the General channel even if channel moderation is enabled. A workaround is to publish assignments in another channel where channel moderation is enabled, and in channel settings you have enabled "Allow bots to submit channel messages".
- Create team from an existing class team is currently broken, but a fix is expected in a few days.
- In some scenarios, students or teachers in your tenant, with the correct policy assigned, still might not be automatically moved to New Teams. Please encourage them to use the toggle to switch to New Teams.
- If you see a toggle to switch to New Teams but it's greyed out with an error message, please see: [**Troubleshooting installation issues**](new-teams-troubleshooting-installation.md)
- Support for external Shared Channels when using *Grid view* is not available. While waiting for a fix a workaround is to use *List view*.
- Custom backgrounds for announcement posts in channels will be available for *Faculty licensed* users after January 10th, while the release for students is delayed pending the availability of policy controls.
