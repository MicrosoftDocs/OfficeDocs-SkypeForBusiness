# Known issues for new Microsoft Teams

- Language-aware spell checking is currently not available in the new Teams. The team is focusing on this issue with a high priority. Check back for updates.
- New Teams client isn't respecting the date time formats set in the OS. This issue affects both 12h/24h time formatting and date formatting in the product. A fix is pending; check back for updates.
- [A website doesn't load in the new Teams desktop](/microsoftteams/troubleshoot/tabs/websites-not-loaded-new-teams).
- [The new Teams desktop app fails to render video](/microsoftteams/troubleshoot/meetings/new-teams-desktop-app-fail-render-video).
- Collaborative Notes is only available in public clouds, and not in EDU (Academic SKUs).
- The app crashes on startup with the error APPLICATION_FAULT_c06d007e_PvDSSource64.ax if the Pleora Technologies eBUS SDK is installed. Update to the latest version of the SDK or uninstall.
- Some users can't join meeting from Outlook Desktop calendar. Open Teams and instead join from Teams calendar.
