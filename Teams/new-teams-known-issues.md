# Known issues for new Microsoft Teams

- PowerPoint Live Standout isn't yet available.
- Language-aware spell checking is currently not available in the new Teams. The team is focusing on this issue with a high priority. Check back for updates.
- New Teams client isn't respecting the date time formats set in the OS. This issue affects both 12h/24h time formatting and date formatting in the product. A fix is pending; check back for updates.
- The app will crash if users hit enter instead of clicking the *Create* button after entering the team name in the team creation wizard.
- The calendar icon will show an error message for users not licensed with Exchange Online. A fix to hide the calendar icon for these users is expected soon.
- [Cross Cloud Guest Access (CCGA) accounts](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-support/cross-cloud-meeting-amp-cross-cloud-guest-access-between-ww/ba-p/3990829) aren't yet shown on the Web client. Until this feature is available, users can use CCGA meeting-join links or navigate directly to the cloud-specific URL in a new tab.
- If using classic Teams for Web to open a [Cross Cloud Meeting (CCM)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-support/cross-cloud-meeting-amp-cross-cloud-guest-access-between-ww/ba-p/3990829) link into a cloud where the user is opted into new Teams for web, the meeting join will fail. Until a fix is ready, users can navigate directly to the cloud-specific URL to join their meeting.
- [A website doesn't load in the new Teams desktop](/microsoftteams/troubleshoot/tabs/websites-not-loaded-new-teams).
- [The new Teams desktop app fails to render video](/microsoftteams/troubleshoot/meetings/new-teams-desktop-app-fail-render-video).
- Collaborative Notes is only available in public clouds, and not in EDU (Academic SKUs).
- Users may receive an error message when trying to open a document attached to a cross-post shared from a team where they're not a member. A fix is expected by mid-March.
- Scheduling a Teams Live Event (TLE) redirects to the classic Teams web experience. This feature will continue to work even after the deprecation of classic Teams.
- When editing a TLE on the web, users can't use the **Join** and **Chat** buttons. Selecting these buttons doesn't take the user to the join or chat experiences.
- When editing a TLE on the web, users can't use the **Manage live event resources** link at the bottom of the page. Selecting the link redirects the user to a different page. Resources for the event, can be found at the top of the page.
- The **Manage live event resources** link in the calendar invite doesn't work outside of Teams. Users must open the invite in Teams calendar to edit the session and access event resources.
- If a user closes a TLE session on the web, the next time they open Teams on the web, Teams might try and relaunch the last TLE event the user was in.
- The app will crash on startup with the error APPLICATION_FAULT_c06d007e_PvDSSource64.ax if the Pleora Technologies eBUS SDK is installed. Update to the latest version of the SDK or uninstall.

We currently have no EDU-specific features, but this may change.

## What features are changing?

As we improved the client, the experience also improved to align with similar features. Learn more: [**Features that are changing in the new Microsoft Teams**](new-teams-whats-changing.md)
