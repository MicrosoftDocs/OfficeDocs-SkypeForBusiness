# Kaizala and Microsoft Teams 

In April of 2019, we [announced](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-kaizala-blog/update-on-kaizala-features-coming-to-microsoft-teams/ba-p/974525) plans to bring **Kaizala together with Microsoft Teams**. The capabilities of Kaizala complement the robust communication and collaboration capabilities of Teams, the hub for teamwork in Microsoft 365.

Open the door to an entirely new way of doing business with Microsoft Teams. Teams extends the capabilities of Kaizala - bringing together chat, meetings, calling, collaboration, app integration, and file storage into a single interface. Teams helps customers realize more value from their investments and improves the frontline worker’s day-to-day experience.

Teams improves workplace collaboration by helping organizations move from an array of disparate apps to a single, secure hub that brings together what teams need, including chat, meetings, and calling, all with native integration to the Office 365 apps. Currently, more than 500,000 organizations use Teams to collaborate across locations, time zones, and languages.

Microsoft Teams will be replacing the Kaizala service as the primary communication client in Microsoft 365 for both internal employees and people in your extended networks.

**The first set of Kaizala Pro capabilities is now available in Teams and include Kaizala actions now available as Teams [app templates](/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates), such as [polls](/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates#poll), [surveys](/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates#survey), [checklists](/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates#checklist), [quizzes](/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates#quiz--), and [training](/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates#training--).**

Enabling every member of an organization’s network with digital communication and collaboration tools can transform the way work gets done. This overview will help you start your transition from Kaizala to Microsoft Teams today.

>[!NOTE]
> In light of the sudden shift to remote work in 2020, we pivoted resources to respond to the exponential increase in Microsoft Teams usage and supporting customers in maintaining continuity during this unprecedented and challenging time. As a result, our efforts to bring additional Kaizala features to teams have been [delayed](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-kaizala-blog/update-on-kaizala-features-in-microsoft-teams/ba-p/1497289). We look forward to providing an update on timing in the coming months as we make adjustments.

## FAQ

## When should my organization move from Kaizala to Teams?

We encourage all Microsoft 365 and Office 365 customers to start using [Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software?ms.officeurl=teams&rtc=1&OCID=AID2388518_SEM_Ks5ySdZ9) today to take advantage of the rich capabilities that Teams provides. These capabilities include a simple and powerful experience for mobile users in 46 languages and 181 markets. Empower your frontline worker staff with capabilities such as shift management, guest access, and support for custom workflows and apps with Microsoft Flow and PowerApps. For specific Kaizala functionality that isn't yet available in Teams, we'll be posting an updated integration timeline in the future.

## How can I continue to use Kaizala Pro if I had purchased the standalone offering?

As of July 1, 2020, Microsoft has ended sales of the Kaizala Pro standalone service. Kaizala and Teams will continue to be accessible as [part of the Microsoft 365 and Office 365 plans](/Office365/Kaizala/migrate-kaizala-pro).

## How can I get started with Teams?

Download [Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) from the app store, and access training and resources in our [help center](https://support.microsoft.com/teams?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) to get started. You can also join the [Teams Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams/ct-p/MicrosoftTeams) to give feedback, vote on feature requests, and engage with an awesome community.

## What can I do to prepare for the integration of Kaizala capabilities in Teams?

Start using Teams today for solutions that can empower communication across your organization. Teams isn’t just an upgrade for Kaizala, it’s a powerful tool that opens the door to an entirely new way of doing business. Teams is uniquely positioned for various frontline worker user scenarios, thanks to the introduction of Teams Essentials designed for small and mid-size businesses (SMB) and the ability to collaborate with external users only using a phone number with Teams for personal use.

## Will I have the ability to sign in and add users with a phone number on Teams?

Users can sign in to Teams with a phone number by using Teams for personal accounts.

With Microsoft Teams Connect, users have the ability to add external users with phone numbers. Users can collaborate with external users by leveraging Teams for work and Teams for personal use interoperability.

External user collaboration in Teams can also be done with guest access with personal or official email.
