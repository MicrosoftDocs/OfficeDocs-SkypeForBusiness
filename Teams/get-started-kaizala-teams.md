# Kaizala and Microsoft Teams 

> [!Important]
> Microsoft Kaizala has retired on August 31, 2023. We recommend using Microsoft Teams for continued connection, sharing, and collaboration.

In August of 2022, we announced plans to retire Microsoft Kaizala on August 31, 2023. That announcement reflects our ongoing commitment to Microsoft Teams. Over the past few years, we've worked closely with customers to help drive Teams innovation, and we can confidently recommend it as the preferred solution for Kaizala users. 

Open the door to an entirely new way of doing business with Microsoft Teams. Teams extends the capabilities of Kaizala - bringing together chat, meetings, calling, collaboration, app integration, and file storage into a single interface. Teams helps customers realize more value from their investments and improves the frontline workers' day-to-day experience.

Teams improves workplace collaboration by helping organizations move from an array of disparate apps to a single, secure hub that brings together what teams need, including chat, meetings, and calling, all with native integration to the Office 365 apps. Currently, organizations worldwide use Teams to collaborate across locations, time zones, and languages.

Microsoft Teams is replacing Kaizala as the primary communication client in Microsoft 365 for both internal employees and people in your extended networks.

Kaizala Pro capabilities are now available in Teams and include Kaizala actions that are now available as Teams [app templates](/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates), such as [polls](/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates#poll), [surveys](/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates#survey), [checklists](/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates#checklist), [quizzes](/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates#quiz--), and [training](/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates#training--). We've recently released the capability for any Teams user to interact with external users through their phone numbers. For more information, see the [blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/microsoft-teams-users-can-now-chat-with-any-teams-user-outside/ba-p/3070832) and [article](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-or-invite-people-outside-your-teams-org-to-a-chat-6897ab47-9f60-4db6-8b95-18599714fe57).

Enabling every member of an organization’s network with digital communication and collaboration tools can transform the way work gets done. This overview helps you start your transition from Kaizala to Microsoft Teams today.
