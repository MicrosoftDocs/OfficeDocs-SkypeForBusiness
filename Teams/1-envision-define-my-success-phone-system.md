# Define my success

This article gives an overview of the requirements for defining success for the deployment of Phone System with Calling Plans for your organization. By properly defining what success looks like, you can measure your results as you progress through your deployment and verify that the outcomes you achieve are the ones you wanted.

## Define business use cases for Phone System with Calling Plans

Organizations can use Phone System with Calling Plans to modernize their workplace by enabling users to make business-related phone calls from their computers and mobile devices.

Workplace modernization can be part of any number of scenarios—an activity-based working implementation, a major office move, an office fit-out refresh, retiring a legacy private branch exchange (PBX) solutions, the conclusion of a public switched telephone network (PSTN) service provider contract, and so on.

To begin with, core project stakeholders need to define business use cases that support the implementation of Phone System with Calling Plans.

Business use cases are meant to define and document expected, measurable business outcomes, and include the following:

-   Description of the current business process

-   Challenges with the existing business process

-   How technology can help overcome these challenges

-   The expected and measurable business outcomes if these challenges are overcome

> [!TIP]
> The following is an example of a completed business use case:
> 
> |         |
> |---------|
> |**Description of current business process**<br>Standard configuration of Contoso’s office workspaces includes a desktop phone for every desk. Each employee has been given a direct inward dialing (DID) phone number. The desktop phones are connected to a PBX system, and connected to PSTN via a session initiation protocol (SIP) trunk. Employees can only make and receive phone calls at their assigned desktop phones.|
> |**Challenges with existing business process**<br>Usage analysis of the desktop phones shows that only 10% of the desktop phones are actively used, with the rest configured either to forward calls to mobile phones or to simultaneously ring to mobile phones. Maintaining the existing PBX system and associated desktop phones contributes to 20% of Contoso’s monthly telephony service cost.|
> |**How technology can overcome these challenges**<br>Phone System with Calling Plans will allow a user’s personal computer to receive and place phone calls over the data network by leveraging the native Microsoft Teams app. This removes the need to roll out and maintain desktop phones, and opens the opportunity to decommission the existing PBX system, because the phone service can be delivered via the cloud over the network with no dependency on a traditional phone system.|
> |**Expected, measurable, business outcomes**<br>Removing maintenance requirements and decommissioning legacy PBX and desktop phones will deliver a 20% reduction in monthly telephony service expenses. Phone System with Calling Plans will simplify office workspaces, allowing Contoso to expand its operations by establishing new offices with minimal upfront telephony costs.|

In addition to defining your business use cases, to set the project boundaries you should aim to drive clarity around:

In addition to defining your business use cases, to set the project boundaries you should aim to drive clarity around:

-   **Organizational scope:** The implementation of Phone System with Calling Plans might encompass the whole organization or just specific business units.

-   **Project timeline:** The specific timeline the project will run.

## Define OKRs, KSIs, and risks

With the project stakeholders assembled, you can translate business use cases, organizational scope, and project timelines into objectives and key results (OKRs), and the measures of project success can be defined as a list of key success indicators (KSIs).

Full participation from project stakeholders in defining OKRs and KSIs is essential to help ensure they feel a sense of ownership and align these measures of success to organizational business requirements.

OKRs contain the objectives you set in the beginning of the project, and you define measurable key results on a quarterly basis. You review key results monthly to track the status of the overall project, and—based on progress—you adjust quarterly plans as needed.

> [!TIP]
> Example of OKRs relevant to Phone System with Calling Plans implementation can be referenced below:
> <br>
> 
> **Vision: Increase productivity by maximizing Office 365 investments**
> 
> |Objectives  |Key Results  |To Do  |
> |---------|---------|---------|
> |Deploy Phone System with Calling Plans in European branch offices by end of fiscal year 2018|FY18Q3: Deploy Phone System with Calling Plans in London office|Envision<ul><li>Create success plan</li><li>Create detailed technical implementation plan</li></ul><p>Onboard<ul><li>Execute success plan</li><li>Execute technical implementation plan</li></ul>|
> |Decommission legacy PBX in London office by end of fiscal year 2018|FY18Q4: Decommission legacy PBX in London office|Drive Value<ul><li>Boost user engagement and drive adoption</li><li>Manage and prepare change</li><li>Measure, share success, and iterate</li>|

KSIs measure quality and success of the key results, and complement the binary nature of OKRs (achieved or not achieved) by detailing good and/or bad results.

When defining KSIs, we recommend that you use “specific, measurable, assignable, realistic, time-related” (SMART) criteria:

-   Specific: target a specific area for improvement

-   Measurable: quantify, or at least suggest an indicator of, progress

-   Assignable: specify who will do it

-   Realistic: state what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources

-   Time-related: specify when the results can be achieved

> [!TIP]
> The following is an example of KSI relevant to this project:
> 
> |Type  |KSI question & criteria  |How measured  |Success criteria  |Measured  |Responsible  |
> |---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
> |Usage/adoption|Call quality is equal to or better than the previous solution|Survey|80% of users agree or strongly agree|After enablement and quarterly|Information Technology team|
> |Usage/adoption|Microsoft Teams made the communication process easier|Survey|80% of users agree or strongly agree|After enablement and quarterly|Change Management team|
> |Usage/adoption|Users actively use the solution|Office 365 reports, Call Quality Dashboard|80% of users are active daily users|Daily|Change Management team|
> |Usage/quality|Percentage of poor calls/conferences should be minimal|Call Quality Dashboard|< 5% of poor calls per month|Daily|Information Technology team|
> |Usage/support|I know how to get technical support|Survey|90% of users agree or strongly agree|After enablement and quarterly|Change Management team|
> |Usage/support|I am satisfied with the quality of technical support|Survey|80% of users agree or strongly agree|After each incident|Information Technology team|
> |Financial|Reduction of legacy conferencing minutes|Financial system|Meet defined ROI|Based on ROI|Change Management team|

You need to identify business risks as part of this exercise and define a mitigation plan for each identified risk. Capture this information in a risks register.

> [!TIP]
> Your risk register can be documented as the example below:
> 
> |Risk  |Likelihood  |Impact  |Overall  |Mitigation plan  |
> |---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
> |Upcoming merger will add up to 1,000 people|High|High|High|<ul><li>For merged companies, create a separate OKR that applies to their own project phases (Envision, Onboard, Drive Value)</li><li>Don’t include these OKRs in existing OKRs</li></ul>|
> |Telephone number porting will delay project completion|High|High|High|<ul><li>Prepare all the information required to support telephone number porting ahead of time (customer service record, billing details, Letter of Authorization)</li><li>Adjust the project timeline to accommodate the turnaround time of telephone number porting execution</li><li>Use temporary telephone numbers with Caller ID manipulation</li></ul>|
> |Planned network redesign|High|Medium|Medium|<ul><li>Before implementing Teams as a modern communications and collaboration platform, conduct a network readiness assessment for sites in scope of the project</li></ul>|

## Establish a steering committee

A steering committee is a governing group of key stakeholders and project leaders who have been brought together to guide a project or program toward its defined business outcomes. The steering committee isn’t directly responsible for *how* the project is delivered, but rather *what* the project delivers to the business.

Every project requires an agreed-on vision and charter. To deliver the outcomes you want from the project, the vision must be clearly defined, and it needs to be monitored and maintained. This becomes the responsibility of the steering committee: to drive decisions, advise, provide strategic oversight, to serve as advocates to the organization for the project’s initiatives, and—when necessary—remove blockers.

Your organization should put significant thought into the formation of the steering committee. The committee must ensure that the project achieves the business objectives you’ve defined for driving change throughout the organization, meet periodically to discuss the current pulse of the project, and help unblock any obstacles that are encountered along the way.

The committee should define its charter to include some key objectives:

-   Keep a strong alignment between the project team and the executive sponsor or executive leadership.

-   Provide insight into the status of the project to the executive sponsor or executive leadership.

-   Allow the executive sponsor or executive leadership team to provide direction and input to the project and ensure that it aligns with overarching business goals, by adjusting project plans, objective key results (OKRs), and other project activities.

The steering committee meets at a recurring interval throughout the lifetime of a project to ensure alignment between the organizational leadership and the project team. This critical meeting ensures that the direction of the project has leadership’s full support and incorporates any feedback provided by leadership into the project to drive success. The committee uses these meetings to gain insight into project status, and to:

-   Agree on business outcomes that align to the business case, and to ensure the project is driving towards delivery of these outcomes.

-   Check and approve the project for accuracy and compliance with the business case.

-   Review and verify changes made to the business case that could affect any defined outcomes.

-   Make strategic decisions regarding the prioritization of project deliverables, and approve interim deliverables.

-   Identify, manage, and mitigate gaps, risks, and issues where additional influence is required from the committee.

-   Gather support from the executive sponsor or executive leadership team for issues that require escalation, prioritizing and resolving any conflicts between stakeholder business units. 

-   Provide formal feedback and recommendations to executive leadership, the change advisory board, or other business and IT stakeholders, as applicable.
