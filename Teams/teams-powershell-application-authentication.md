# Application-based authentication in Teams PowerShell Module

Application-based authentication is supported now in Teams PowerShell Module with 
  - Versions 4.7.1-preview or later in commercial & GCC environments.
  - Versions 5.0.1-preview or later in GCC High & DoD environments.


## Cmdlets Supported

All cmdlets are supported now, except for the cmdlets mentioned below. 

  - New-Team
  - [Get|Set|New|Sync]-CsOnlineApplicationInstance
  - \*PolicyPackage\*
  - \*-CsTeamsShiftsConnection\*
  - \*-CsBatchTeamsDeployment\*
  - [Get|Set]-CsTeamsSettingsCustomApp
  - Get-MultiGeoRegion


## Examples

The following examples show how to use Teams PowerShell Module with the Azure AD app-based authentication: 

- Connect using a certificate thumbprint:

  ```powershell
  Connect-MicrosoftTeams -CertificateThumbprint "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" -ApplicationId "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" -TenantId "YYYYYYYY-YYYY-YYYY-YYYY-YYYYYYYYYYYY"
  ```
  When you use the CertificateThumbprint parameter, the certificate needs to be installed on the computer where you're running the command. The certificate should be installed in the user certificate store.
  
- Connect using a certificate object:

  ```powershell
  Connect-MicrosoftTeams -Certificate <%X509Certificate2 object%> -ApplicationId "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" -TenantId "YYYYYYYY-YYYY-YYYY-YYYY-YYYYYYYYYYYY"
  ```
  When you use the Certificate parameter, the certificate doesn't need to be installed on the computer where you're running the command. The certificate can be remotely stored & fetched when the script is run. The Certificate parameter is available from Teams PowerShell Module version 4.9.2-preview or later.
  
- Connect using Access Tokens:
  
  Access Tokens can be retrieved via the login.microsoftonline.com endpoint. It requires two Access Tokens – “MS Graph” and “Skype and Teams Tenant Admin API” resources.

  ```powershell
  $ClientSecret   = "…"
  $ApplicationID = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  $TenantID = "YYYYYYYY-YYYY-YYYY-YYYY-YYYYYYYYYYYY"

  $graphtokenBody = @{   
     Grant_Type    = "client_credentials"   
     Scope         = "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default"   
     Client_Id     = $ApplicationID   
     Client_Secret = $ClientSecret   
  }  

  $graphToken = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://login.microsoftonline.com/$TenantID/oauth2/v2.0/token" -Method POST -Body $graphtokenBody | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Access_Token 

  $teamstokenBody = @{   
     Grant_Type    = "client_credentials"   
     Scope         = "48ac35b8-9aa8-4d74-927d-1f4a14a0b239/.default"   
     Client_Id     = $ApplicationID   
     Client_Secret = $ClientSecret 
  } 

  $teamsToken = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://login.microsoftonline.com/$TenantID/oauth2/v2.0/token" -Method POST -Body $teamstokenBody | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Access_Token 

  Connect-MicrosoftTeams -AccessTokens @("$graphToken", "$teamsToken")
  ```
  
## How does it work?

Teams PowerShell Module fetches the app-based token using the application ID, tenant ID and certificate thumbprint. The application object provisioned inside Azure AD has a Directory Role assigned to it, which is returned in the access token. The session's role-based access control (RBAC) is configured using the directory role information that's available in the token.


## Setup Application-based authentication

An initial onboarding is required for authentication using application objects. Application and service principal are used interchangeably, but an application is like a class object while a service principal is like an instance of the class. You can learn more about these objects at [Application and service principal objects in Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals).

Sample steps for creating applications in Azure AD are mentioned below. For detailed steps, refer to this [article](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal).

1. Register the application in Azure AD.
2. Assign API permissions to the application.
   - For \*-Cs cmdlets - the Microsoft Graph API permission needed is `Organization.Read.All`.
   - For Non \*-Cs cmdlets - the Microsoft Graph API permissions needed are `Organization.Read.All`, `User.Read.All`, `Group.ReadWrite.All`, `AppCatalog.ReadWrite.All`, `TeamSettings.ReadWrite.All`, `Channel.Delete.All`, `ChannelSettings.ReadWrite.All`, `ChannelMember.ReadWrite.All`.  
3. Generate a self-signed certificate.
4. Attach the certificate to the Azure AD application.
5. Assign [Azure AD roles](/microsoftteams/using-admin-roles#teams-roles-and-capabilities) to the application. Refer to this [Assign a role](/azure/active-directory/roles/manage-roles-portal#assign-a-role) procedure, but search for the application instead of a user.

The application needs to have the appropriate RBAC roles assigned. Because the apps are provisioned in Azure AD, you can use any of the supported built-in roles.
