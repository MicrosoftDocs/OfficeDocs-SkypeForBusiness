# Understand how users can block PSTN calls on Microsoft Teams desktop and mobile clients

If users are receiving calls that they don’t want to receive on their Microsoft Teams desktop or mobile (iOS or Android) clients, they can use the block calls feature to prevent future calls from the sender. Users can also manage their blocked caller list.

This feature allows users to reduce the following types of calls:

- Unknown callers (no  caller ID)
- Spam calls
- Robo calls
- Calls from telemarketers
- Calls from others whom they don’t want to speak to.

For more information and steps to block callers, see [Manage your call settings in Teams](https://support.office.com/article/Manage-your-call-settings-in-Teams-456cb611-3477-496f-b31a-6ab752a7595f).
