# Start an Audio Conference over the phone without a PIN in Microsoft Teams

It might be frustrating for users who dial in to a meeting to be held in the meeting's lobby listening to music because the Microsoft Teams meeting organizer hasn't started the meeting. 
  
If a meeting organizer calls in to the meeting, by default, a PIN is required to start a meeting. You can set it up so that anyone can dial in to a meeting and not be prompted for a PIN to start the meeting. You can use the admin center to enable or disable this setting for a single user.
  
A PIN isn't required for the meeting organizer if someone has started the meeting from the Microsoft Teams app. A PIN is only required when a meeting organizer joins their meeting over a phone. The PIN for meetings is sent to the audio user when they are assigned the **Audio Conferencing** license and are enabled for Audio Conferencing. See [Send an email to a user with their Audio Conferencing information](send-an-email-to-a-user-with-their-dial-in-information-in-teams.md) and [Emails that are automatically sent to users when their Audio Conferencing settings change](emails-sent-to-users-when-their-settings-change-in-teams.md).

1. In the left navigation, click **Users**. 

2. Select a user in the list, and then click **Edit** at the top of the page. 

3. Next to **Audio Conferencing**, click **Edit**.

4. In the **Audio Conferencing** pane, enable or disable **Unauthenticated callers can be the first person in a meeting**.
    
4. Click **Save**. 

**Using Windows Powershell**
  
See the [Microsoft Teams PowerShell reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/teams/?view=teams-ps) for more information.

## What else should you know?

- If you want to reset the PIN, see [Reset the Audio Conferencing PIN](reset-the-audio-conferencing-pin-in-teams.md).
    
- If anonymous access, or not requiring a PIN to start a meeting, is enabled:
    
  - If the meeting hasn't started (there's no one in the meeting yet): A caller will be prompted if he's the organizer; if he says yes, he'll be prompted for his PIN, and after he inputs the PIN, the meeting will start and the user will join the meeting.
    
  - If the meeting already started (someone else is already in the meeting): A caller won't be prompted if he's the organizer and he'll never be prompted for the PIN; the meeting is already started, and the caller will join it.
    
- If anonymous access, or not requiring a PIN to start a meeting, is disabled:
    
  - If the meeting hasn't started (there's no one in the meeting yet): A caller won't be prompted if she's the organizer, and she'll never be prompted for the PIN. Because the setting of the organizer is set to off, the meeting will start and the anonymous callers will join the meeting.
    
  - If the meeting already started (someone else is already in the meeting): A caller won't be prompted if she's the organizer, and she'll never be prompted for the PIN,;the meeting is already started, and the caller will join it.
