## Getting Started

Getting started on your move from Kaizala to Teams is easier than ever with our getting started guide. To learn more about starting your Microsoft Teams journey, see [Getting started with Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/start-and-pin-chats-a864b052-5e4b-4ccf-b046-2e26f40e21b5?wt.mc_id=otc_microsoft_teams&ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us).

## Starting new chats, 1:1 audio and video calls

Create 1:1 or group chats to collaborate with a smaller group or to talk privately within Teams. You can pin chats and save messages for quick access. To begin chatting with our rich text formatting, emojis, and gifs, see [Chats in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/start-and-pin-chats-a864b052-5e4b-4ccf-b046-2e26f40e21b5?wt.mc_id=otc_microsoft_teams&ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us).

Communicate efficiently by starting 1:1 or group calls with anyone in your organization. With Teams,  you have the flexibility to make both audio and video calls.  To get started, see [Make calls](https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE4rxv0?pid=ocpVideo0-innerdiv-oneplayer&postJsllMsg=true&maskLevel=20&market=en-us).

You can move from Kaizala groups to Microsoft Teams through the creation of Teams, channels, and group chats in Teams.

Teams is a collection of people, content, and tools surrounding different projects and outcomes within an organization.

Teams is made up of **channels**, which are the topic-specific conversations you have with your teammates. Each channel is dedicated to a specific topic, department, or project. Channels are most valuable when extended with applications. To learn more, see [work in channels](https://support.microsoft.com/office/teams-and-channels-df38ae23-8f85-46d3-b071-cb11b9de5499?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us#ID0EAABAAA=Work_in_channels).

**Group chats** allow you to gather your coworkers quick huddle over instant messaging.

### Conversations in Teams Chat vs Team Channel

|Conversations in Chat | Conversations in Team Channels |
|---------|---------|
|For lightweight conversations, where you’re directly messaging recipients.   | For interactions where multiple topics are discussed in an open space.  |
|Private chats are only visible to those in the chat     | Visible to everyone in the Team        |
|One continuous, unthreaded conversation     | Structured, multiple threaded conversations        |
|Up to 250 people     | Up to 25,000 people        |
|Choose if you want to share chat history with new chat participants     | History is shared with all new Team members        |
|New chat recipients must be added by those people already in chat     | Users can join a team by searching for it. In private Teams, Teams admin approves new members. Channel members can generate code to enable new members to join directly without admin approval.        |
|On the spot screen share, and audio and video calling. Easy scheduling of Teams meetings with all chat participants     | On the spot and scheduled audio and video calling        |
|Some extensibility with apps     | Full extensibility and customization with apps        |

For an overview on Teams, channels, and group chats, see [teams and channels in Microsoft Teams](teams-channels-overview.md).

## Moving your Kaizala groups to Microsoft Teams

In Kaizala, groups are a collection of people. There are three types of group structures within Kaizala - flat groups, hierarchy groups, and broadcast groups. As you transition to Microsoft Teams, you can use Teams, Channels, and group chats to create similar communication structures for your organization.

Use the guidance that follows for instructions on switching from Groups to Teams, Channels, and group chats.

There are two ways to move your Kaizala flat groups to Teams:

- Option 1: Switching from a Kaizala flat group to a group chat in Teams

- Option 2: Switch from a Kaizala flat group to a Teams team

**Option 1: Switch from a Kaizala flat group to a group chat in Teams**

You can create a Teams group chat to hold quick huddles and transient conversations with up to 250 participants. Group chats allow people in your organization to have a central place for open conversation where anyone can be added to chat.

1. Start and name a group chat.

    ![Name a group chat](media/kaizala-to-teams-image4.png)

    Everyone who has access to the group chat can [send messages](https://support.microsoft.com/office/send-and-read-messages-in-teams-b29e60ec-76af-4d97-8c3c-a4e36f2b64aa?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us).

2. Add people to the conversation.

    ![Add people to the conversation](media/kaizala-to-teams-image5.png)
    
   When adding someone to a group chat (not a one-on-one), you can include the **chat history** and **duration of history** you want to share with them.

3. Manage group chat.
  
    ![Manage group chat](media/manage-groupchats.png)
    
   To see who's in a group chat, hover over the number of participants in the chat header to show a list of everyone's names.

**Option 2: Switch from a Kaizala flat group to a Teams team**
   
For targeted large group communication, you can create a Team for a flat group. You can add up to 25,000 members to engage in structured communication with threaded conversations. This type of communication allows for moderation and administration roles to ensure that things are running smoothly.

1. Create a team:
   To get up and running in Teams, you should create a team, add people, and add channels. To learn more, see [your first teams](get-started-with-teams-create-your-first-teams-and-channels.md).
2. Review the guide for team owners:

As a [team owner](https://support.microsoft.com/office/go-to-guide-for-team-owners-92d238e6-0ae2-447e-af90-40b1052c4547?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us), you can add new members and guests, change members into owners, manage channels and settings, and archive a team that's no longer in use.

3. Add bulk members to a team:

    If you're a team owner, go to the team name in the teams list and select the **More options** button > then **Add member**.

    ![Add bulk members](media/kaizala-to-teams-image6.png)

    You can start typing a distribution list, security group, or Microsoft 365 group to add to your team. To learn more, see [Add members to a team in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-members-to-a-team-in-teams-aff2249d-b456-4bc3-81e7-52327b6b38e9?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us).

### Mimic the consumer app messaging experience

If you prefer a simplified experience for your users,  you can choose to configure your organization’s  Teams experience to mimic the consumer tools your users are already using.

We recommend starting the Teams journey for your Kaizala users with **Show favorite channels in Chat** enabled for simplified communications and Shifts (optional).

![Display favorite channels setting in admin center](media/kaizala-to-teams-image26.png)

Here's an example of the Team's interface with **Shifts**:

![Messaging experience with Shifts](media/kaizala-to-teams-image24.png)

Here's an example of Team's interface **without Shifts**:

 ![Messaging experience without Shifts](media/kaizala-to-teams-images25.png)

> [!NOTE]
> You can remove access to the Teams button to create a simplified interface for Frontline workers with only highlighted channels showing up above chats. To learn more, see [Manage messaging policies in Teams](messaging-policies-in-teams.md).

### Use Teams and Channels to create a hierarchical group structure

In Kaizala, hierarchical groups allow your organization to interact in different group structures depending on the type of communication between members.  In Teams, you can create Teams and channels to match your org chart and set up hierarchy-based communication. You can use a hierarchical structure within Teams to alert members of needed actions, important news, and updates.

![Teams hierarchy chart](media/kaizala-to-teams-image7.png)

![District manager and store associate's interface of Teams channels](media/kaizala-to-teams-image27.png)

To learn more, see our [best practices for organizing teams in Microsoft Teams](best-practices-organizing.md).

### Use Teams and Channels to broadcast important news

In a Kaizala broadcast group, admins can send messages and actions to a targeted group. Similarly, you can post across multiple channels to broadcast a message in Teams. To direct attention to an important message, create Announcements posts.

Channel moderation allows you to control who can post and reply to messages. Channels can be chosen across the teams for the broadcaster to reach a larger audience. You can restrict interactions on announcements only permitting select admins and moderators with the ability to reply. Follow these steps to establish channel moderation within a Teams channel.

**Step 1**: Setup Channel Moderation.

- Select a channel for broadcasts

- Select **Channel settings** to set up moderation

- Navigate to "Who are the moderators?" to manually select moderators for your channel

![Set up Teams Channel Moderation](media/kaizala-to-teams-image8.png)

**Step 2**: Format your message.
  Create an announcement to notify team members of important news or actions.

   ![Teams announcements](media/kaizala-to-teams-image9.png)

- In the channel, select Format  under the box where you type your message.

- At the top of box that appears, select the arrow next to New conversation > Announcement.

- Type a headline, change its background color, or add a background image for the headline area.

- Type the subject of your announcement in the Add a subhead area, then the body of your message, and select Send button.
    ![Mobile announcement](media/kaizala-to-teams-image10.png)

**Step 3**: Select channels for Message broadcast.

You can cross-post across multiple Teams and channels when you have important announcements and information that need to reach large groups of people.

  ![Choose a channel for broadcast](media/kaizala-to-teams-image11.png)

To learn more, see [Cross-post a channel conversation in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/cross-post-a-channel-conversation-in-teams-9c1252a3-67ef-498e-a7c1-dd7147b3d295?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us).

## Getting work done in Teams

When it comes to getting work done, the right tools can enable efficiency. In Kaizala, you can use [Out-of-box (OOB) Action cards](/kaizala/partnerdocs/kaizalaactioncards) to make daily work management easier and efficient.
 Microsoft Teams provides several capabilities and solution for Out of Box Action cards in Kaizala.

![Engage your people with Teams](media/kaizala-to-teams-image12.png)

## Moving Kaizala Custom Solutions to Microsoft Teams

![Moving Kaizala to Teams](media/kaizala-to-teams-image1.png)

Follow this three-step approach to get your solutions to Microsoft Teams:

1. Consider solution usage and frequency.

    High usage and frequency for solutions merits a stronger case for custom development.

2. Consider solution complexity.

    Solutions with higher complexity may warrant a stronger case for custom development.

3. Explore the following approaches per usage frequency and complexity.

    - Explore workarounds with [native Microsoft Teams capabilities](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/capabilities-overview)

    - Use [3P app integrations](deploy-apps-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md)

    - Discover [App templates](/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates)

## Management in Microsoft Teams

### IT Professionals

Make the administrative transition from the Kaizala Management portal to the Microsoft Teams Admin Center. The Teams admin center is primarily for use of administrator roles only.

Administrators can manage the entire Teams workload, or they can have delegated permissions for troubleshooting call quality problems or managing your organization's telephony needs.

To navigate the admin center, visit [Microsoft Teams Admin Center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/).

You can monitor your organization’s security and compliance across Microsoft 365 with the Microsoft 365 [Compliance Center](/microsoft-365/compliance/microsoft-365-compliance-center) and [Security Center](/microsoft-365/security/defender/overview-security-center).

Protect your business and empower your users in the [Azure Active Directory admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com/#@microsoft.onmicrosoft.com/dashboard/private/c7736064-7b28-4f3d-b366-2740a8d48020) where you can review groups, identity, licenses, and access across Microsoft 365.

## Kaizala Management Portal to Teams Admin Center

To delete a group:

- From the Chats list, press and hold the group conversation.

- Tap Delete group.

## Kaizala Tenant Data export

While using Teams, you can still maintain control of your corporate data in Kaizala. For more information, see [Export tenant data from the management portal](/office365/kaizala/export-or-delete-your-data).

## Collaborating with External Users(Vendors/suppliers/Partners)

Collaborating with vendors, suppliers, partners, and other external users is easier than ever in Microsoft Teams. With Teams, users have the ability to add external users with phone numbers. This is supported with Microsoft Teams Connect. Users within the organization can communicate with external users by using Teams for work and Teams for personal accounts interoperability. External user collaboration in Teams can also be done with guest access using a personal or official email. Cross-posting of announcements across teams and channels is supported with Teams. For example: Your suppliers and vendors would be able to send announcements to each other separate Teams channels or teams. Visit [Send an announcement to a channel](https://support.microsoft.com/office/send-an-announcement-to-a-channel-8f244ea6-235a-4dcc-9143-9c5b801b4992) to learn more about what we support in Teams.

## What is External Access in Teams?

External access is a way for Teams users from an entire external domain to find, call, chat, and set up meetings with you in Teams. To learn more about managing external access, visit [Manage external access](/microsoftteams/manage-external-access).

## What is Guest Access in Teams?

With [guest access](/MicrosoftTeams/guest-access), you can provide access to teams, documents in channels, resources, chats, and applications to people outside your organization, while maintaining control over your corporate data. No additional licensing is required to add Guests in Teams.

## Who can be a Guest in Teams?

A guest is someone who isn't an employee, or member of your organization. They don't have a work account with your organization. For example, guests may include partners, vendors, suppliers, or consultants.
Anyone who isn't part of your organization can be [added as guest in Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/guest-access#how-a-guest-becomes-a-member-of-a-team). This means that anyone with a business account (that is, an Azure Active Directory account) or consumer email account (for example, outlook.com, gmail.com, so on) can participate as a guest in Teams with access to teams and channel experiences.
