# Navigate Microsoft Teams

Now that you have a clear understanding of your organization’s unique path and needs, it's time to get started on your journey to powerful collaboration. Use the section below to learn how to navigate Kaziala’s capabilities complimented within Teams.

## Getting Started
Getting started on your move from Kaizala to Teams is easier than ever with our getting started guide. To learn more about starting your Microsoft Teams journey, see [Getting started with Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/start-and-pin-chats-a864b052-5e4b-4ccf-b046-2e26f40e21b5?wt.mc_id=otc_microsoft_teams&ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us).

## Starting new chats, 1:1 audio and video calls
Create 1:1 or group chats to collaborate with a smaller group or to talk privately within Teams. You can pin chats and save messages for quick access. To begin chatting with our rich text formatting, emojis and gifs, see [Chats in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/start-and-pin-chats-a864b052-5e4b-4ccf-b046-2e26f40e21b5?wt.mc_id=otc_microsoft_teams&ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us).

Communicate efficiently by starting 1:1 or group calls with anyone in your organization. With Teams,  you have the flexibility to make both audio and video calls.  To get started, see [Make calls](https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE4rxv0?pid=ocpVideo0-innerdiv-oneplayer&postJsllMsg=true&maskLevel=20&market=en-us).

## Getting work done

The functionality of Kaizala action cards currently exists within Microsoft Teams. When it comes to getting work done, the right tools can enable efficiency. There are over 300 external applications available now in Microsoft Teams. Keep reading to learn how to use  apps and templates to create [meeting invites](https://support.microsoft.com/office/meetings-in-teams-e0b0ae21-53ee-4462-a50d-ca9b9e217b67), announcements, and precise location check-ins to stay connected across your organization.

### Announcements

You can share important updates and information with your workforce with [Announcements in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/send-an-announcement-to-a-channel-8f244ea6-235a-4dcc-9143-9c5b801b4992).

Create and send messages intended for multiple teams or large number of employees over chat with the [company communicator](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates#company-communicator) app. Its easy interface allows designated users to create, preview, collaborate and send messages in a targeted manner. Build custom targeted communication capabilities such as custom telemetry on how many users acknowledged or interacted with a message with insights directly tied to management decisions.

### Check-ins

Use the Teams Smart Camera to capture and share an annotated image with your Team. Easily share your location with precision to keep your team in the know. Need to have more info to communicate how the Kaizala features map to Teams. Definitely have as much info from the slide deck as we can into the doc.

[Use the Staff checkins](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates#staff-check-ins) app template to enable front line Staff to easily provide time-critical information and status updates on either a scheduled or ad-hoc basis directly from Teams. The app supports real-time location, photos, notes, reminder notifications, and automated workflows.

### Training

Use Teams to make training easy for your organization. You can simplify onboarding by offering access to contextual information. Make employee guides, training, and more easily available and up to date to empower your organization through skilling. To learn more about training scenarios, see [Onboard new employees](https://support.microsoft.com/office/effectively-onboard-new-employees-691faccd-1d1a-4f47-99ac-b6c82973f5ee).

## Management in Microsoft Teams

### IT Professionals

Make the administrative transition from the Kaizala Management portal​ to the Microsoft Teams Admin Center. The Teams admin center is primarily for use of administrator roles only.

Administrators can manage the entire Teams workload, or they can have delegated permissions for troubleshooting call quality problems or managing your organization's telephony needs.

To navigate the admin center, visit [Microsoft Teams Admin Center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/).

You can monitor your organization’s security and compliance across Microsoft 365 with the Microsoft 365 [Compliance Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/microsoft-365-compliance-center) and [Security Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender/overview-security-center).

Protect your business and empower your users in the [Azure Active Directory admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com/#@microsoft.onmicrosoft.com/dashboard/private/c7736064-7b28-4f3d-b366-2740a8d48020) where you can review groups, identity, licenses, and access across Microsoft 365.

### End Users

Users can create teams through the Desktop or mobile app. For adding users in bulk to team – consider creating a team through Office 365 groups, Office 365 distribution lists, or security groups.

Search for anyone in your organization through the Search Bar in teams. You can also use the search bar results to view files, messages, and posts.

Enjoy rich analytics through the help of polls, [surveys](https://www.office.com/launch/forms?auth=2), and [checklists](https://support.microsoft.com/office/get-started-with-lists-in-teams-c971e46b-b36c-491b-9c35-efeddd0297db) with built-in reports and downloadable data. Jobs can also be assigned with the help of [Tasks](https://support.microsoft.com/office/manage-tasks-in-planner-ee61ecb0-a0bb-4c39-8682-f47fe7674f05) in planner.

To enable [extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions) within a Team, use the Connectors option from the menu (…) for any channel for which the connector is required.

To view usage, activity, and overall adoption reports, Team owners can access reports for their teams by navigating from the menu (…) to manage team > analytics.

## Kaizala Group Dissolution​
As you transition to Teams channels and chats, you may consider Kaizala group dissolution to ensure your organization has one central place for communication.  Deleting a Kaizala group removes the group from the Chats list. If you are the only admin in the group, you will need to assign the admin role to at least one person in the group before deleting.

To delete a group:

 • From the Chats list, press and hold the group conversation.

 • Tap Delete group.

## Kaizala Tenant Data export​
While using Teams, you can still maintain control of your corporate data in Kaizala. For more information, see [Export tenant data from the management portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/kaizala/export-or-delete-your-data).

## Collaborating with External Users(Vendors/suppliers/Partners)​

Collaborating with vendors, suppliers, partners, and other external users are easier than ever in Microsoft Teams. Begin communicating externally with Microsoft Teams using external access and guest access. Determine which type of access suits your organization’s collaboration needs with external users.

## What is External Access in Teams?

External access is turned on by default in Teams, which means that your organization can communicate with all external domains. External access is a way for Teams users from an entire external domain to find, call, chat, and set up meetings with you in Teams. To learn more about external access, see [Manage external access](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/manage-external-access).

## What is Guest Access in Teams?

With [guest access](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/guest-access), you can provide access to teams, documents in channels, resources, chats, and applications to people outside your organization, while maintaining control over your corporate data. No additional licensing is required to add Guests in Teams.

## Who can be a Guest in Teams?
A guest is someone who isn't an employee, or member of your organization. They don't have a work account with your organization. For example, guests may include partners, vendors, suppliers, or consultants.

Anyone who isn't part of your organization can be [added as guest in Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/guest-access#how-a-guest-becomes-a-member-of-a-team). This means that anyone with a business account (that is, an Azure Active Directory account) or consumer email account (for example, outlook.com, gmail.com, so on) can participate as a guest in Teams with access to teams and channel experiences.

>[!NOTE]
> Before guests can join a team, guest access must be enabled by an admin in Teams.
