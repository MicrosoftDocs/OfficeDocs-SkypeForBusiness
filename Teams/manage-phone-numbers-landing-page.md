# Manage phone numbers for your organization

Microsoft has two types of telephone numbers available: subscriber (user) numbers, which can be assigned to users in your organization, and service numbers, available as toll and toll-free service numbers. Service numbers have higher concurrent call capacity than subscriber numbers and can be assigned to services such as Audio Conferencing, Auto Attendants, or Call Queues.

You will need to decide:

- Which user locations need new phone numbers from Microsoft?
- Which type of telephone number (subscriber or service) do I need?
- How do I port existing phone numbers to Teams?

How you acquire and manage phone numbers differs depending on your PSTN connectivity option.
