# User work location in Teams

Work location is part of a user's profile in Microsoft Teams (and throughout Microsoft 365). Users can set up work locations for the day in Microsoft Teams and share visibility for the days they're in the office or working from home, making it easier to coordinate in-person meetings. By default, anyone in the organization using Teams can see (in nearly real time) locations set by others.

## Work location states in Teams

|Options |Representation |
|---|---|
|Working remotely |![house icon](./media/work-location-remote.png)|
|Working from office |![building icon](./media/work-location-office.png) |
|Working from office with building details |![add building icon](./media/work-location-add-building-update.png)|

> [!Note]
> Setting building details requires the tenant admin to add building directory details. Once added, users can set their work-location buildings for the day. For more information, see [Opt in to the Microsoft Places Public Preview Program](/deployoffice/places/opt-in-places-preview).

Work location states can be set as a recurring schedule in an Outlook calendar. If a user is setting up recurring work hours and location schedules, it will automatically be set in Teams for those periods of time. Whenever changes come up in a user's schedule, they can update plans in Outlook or Teams. Any changes are reflected in both apps.

> [!NOTE]
> For users who have their mailbox hosted on-premises, when they add work-location building details the experience would be limited.

## User experience with location details in Teams

Users can learn about where co-workers are working on a given day from the profile-card details. [Profile cards](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/profile-cards-in-microsoft-365-e80f931f-5fc4-4a59-ba6e-c1e35a85b501) make it easier for others in your organization to quickly get an overview of your online status, your next available time to meet, your work hours, the local time, and your work location (office or remote).

People you interact with in a group chat will also have location details displayed in the list view. To learn more about setting work locations, see [Set your work location in Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/set-your-work-location-in-microsoft-teams-6c14a0f5-3cd6-427d-b1d2-aa0365aebf88).

Users who are using chat from the same location as the chat recipient will see details displayed on the top header area of the chat message window.

## User settings to edit location sharing

By default, setting the user work location is an opt-in experience. By setting up work locations, users enable anyone in their organization to view this information. Users can set different sharing controls for each work location. For more information, see [Access your Account Privacy Settings](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/access-your-account-privacy-settings-3e7bc183-bf52-4fd0-8e6b-78978f7f121b).
