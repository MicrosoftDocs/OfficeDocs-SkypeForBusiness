# Microsoft Teams external domain activity report

The external domain activity report in the Microsoft Teams admin center shows you how you communicate with managed external organizations over chat. This report includes information for 1:1 chats, group chats, and meeting chats.

> [!NOTE]
> We count the following events as meeting chats: When a user is invited to a meeting, when a meeting ends, and when a user leaves a meeting chat.

This report includes both a base and Teams Premium version, where the base version tells you which domains you communicate with and the premium version exposes more detailed information about your communication with each domain.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have an explicit allowed domains list, this report may include domains not on your allow list. It's possible for users from an allowed organization to start a group chat with users from your organization and users from other organizations allowed by them, but not allowed by you. These domains will show up in your external domain activity report.

## View the usage report

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, select **Analytics & reports** > **Usage reports**. On the **View reports** tab, under **Report**, select **External domain activity**.
1. Under **Date range**, select a predefined date range.
1. Select **Run report**.  

## Interpret the report

|Item                           |Description |
|-------------------------------|------------|
|Domain name                    |The domain name. **Premium:** Each domain can be clicked on to see domain-specific insights. |
|People in my org               |The number of users that have communicated with the organization through chat during the selected time range. |
|**Premium:** Total messages    | The number of messages that have been exchanged between your organization and the external domain during the selected time range. |
|**Premium:** Messages sent     | The number of messages that have been sent to your organization by the external domain during the selected time range. |
|**Premium:** Messages received | The number of messages that have been sent by your organization to the external domain during the selected time range. |

- It's possible to have 0 **people in my org**. If an external domain reaches out to your organization and receives no response, we will display 0 **people in my org**.
- In addition to managed communication, we look at when anonymous users join meetings. If you have **Anonymous user join** turned on, you might have unexpected domains appear on your list. Our reports show the names of the domains of the users who joined meetings, rather than marking them as anonymous.
- Premium columns shouldn't be considered accurate until 7 days, 30 days, and 60 days, respectively, after a premium license was assigned. You may notice 0 in some rows or message counts and user counts not making sense.
- Even if a domain has activity in just one or two, but not all three of the potential date ranges (7 days, 30 days, and 60 days), the domain still surfaces the reports of all three date ranges. It shows total internal users as 0 and all premium columns as 0, if applicable. If it's been over 60 days since a premium license was assigned, you can assume a row of all 0s in the 7d or 30d reports means that there was no communication with the domain during that date range, despite the domain surfacing on the list. There should not be all 0s in a 60d report unless it's been less than 60 days since a premium license was assigned.

|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**Premium:** Username      |The UPN of the user in your org who communicates with the external domain. |
|**Premium:** Messages sent |The number of messages that have been sent to each user by the external domain during the selected time range.|
