# Microsoft Teams user activity report

The Teams user activity report gives insight into the types of activities that users in your organization do in Teams. You can see how many users communicate on an unplanned basis through unscheduled meetings (1:1 and group calls). See how many meetings a Teams user has organized, and meetings a Teams user has participated in. See details about screen, video, and audio minutes, and chat communication statistics, such as how many users reply to and post channel messages, and how many users engage in 1:1 or group chat messages.

> [!NOTE]
> The ability to schedule a user activity report isn't available at this time.

## View the user activity report

You must be a Teams service admin to make these changes. See [Use Teams administrator roles to manage Teams](../using-admin-roles.md) to read about getting admin roles and permissions.

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, select **Analytics & reports** > **Usage reports**. On the **View reports** tab, under **Report**, select **Teams user activity**.
2. Under **Date range**, select a range, and then select **Run report**.

Select **Channel messages**, **Reply messages**,  **Chat messages**, or **Meetings Organized** to see info related to each one. Changing this selection doesnâ€™t change the information in the table. |

## Make the user-specific data anonymous

To make the data in Teams user activity report anonymous, you have to be a global administrator. This will hide identifiable information (using MD5 hashes) such as display name, email, and AAD ID in report and their export.

1. In Microsoft 365 admin center, go to the **Settings** \> **Org Settings**, and under **Services** tab, choose **Reports**.
    
2. Select **Reports**, and then choose to **Display concealed user, group, and site names in all reports**. This setting gets applied both to the usage reports in Microsoft 365 admin center and Teams admin center.
  
3. Select **Save changes**.
