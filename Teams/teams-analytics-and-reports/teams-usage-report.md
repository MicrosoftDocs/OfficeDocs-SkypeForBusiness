# Microsoft Teams usage report

The Teams usage report in the Microsoft Teams admin center gives you an overview of the usage activity in Teams, including the number of active users and channels, so you can quickly see how many users across your organization are using Teams to communicate and collaborate. You can view usage information for  teams, including the number of active users and channels, guests, and messages in each team.

With more added information about internal and external users, you can now measure collaboration within internal and external [shared channels](/Teams/shared-channels.md) in a team. For example, metrics like active shared channels and external active users in a team will help the admin measure collaboration across shared channels within a team.

## View the usage report

You must be either a global admin, global reader, or Teams service admin to view the reports in Teams admin center. See [Use Teams administrator roles to manage Teams](../using-admin-roles.md) to read about getting admin roles and permissions.

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, click **Analytics & reports** > **Usage reports**. On the **View reports** tab, under **Report**, select **Teams usage**.
2. Under **Date range**, select a range, and then click **Run report**.

## Make the user specific data anonymous

To make the data in Teams user activity report anonymous, you have to be a global administrator. The global administrator can hide identifiable information (using MD5 hashes) such as display name, group name, email, and AAD ID in the report and its export.

1. In Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Settings** > **Org Settings**, and under the **Services** tab, choose **Reports**.
    
2. Select **Reports**, and then choose **Display concealed user, group, and site names in all reports**. This setting gets applied both to the usage reports in Microsoft 365 admin center as well as Teams admin center.
  
3. Select **Save changes**.

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling this setting will de-identify user, group, and site name information in [Teams user activity report](user-activity-report.md), [Teams device usage report](device-usage-report.md), and [Teams usage report](teams-usage-report.md). Starting September 1, 2021, this setting is enabled by default for everyone as part of our ongoing commitment to help protect important information and enable companies to support their local privacy laws. 
>
>This setting also applies to Microsoft 365 usage reports in Microsoft 365 admin center, Microsoft Graph, and Power BI.
