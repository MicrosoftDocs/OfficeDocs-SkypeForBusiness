# Microsoft Teams analytics and reporting

A new analytics and reporting experience for Microsoft Teams is available in the Microsoft Teams admin center. You can run different reports to get insights into how users in your organization are using Teams. For example, you can see how many users communicate through channel and chat messages and the kinds of devices they use to connect to Teams. Your organization can use the information from the reports to better understand usage patterns, help make business decisions, and inform training and communication efforts.

## How to access the reports

To access the reports, you must be assigned one of the following roles:

- Global administrator.
- Teams or Skype for Business administrator.
- Global reader (only tenant-level aggregate and no per-user or team data).

To learn more about Teams admin roles and which reports each admin role can access, see [Use Teams administrator roles to manage Teams](../using-admin-roles.md).

Go to the Microsoft Teams admin center, in the left navigation, select **Analytics & reports**, and then under **View Reports**, choose the report you want to run.

> [!NOTE]
> The reports in the Microsoft Teams admin center are separate from the activity reports for Teams that are part of the Microsoft 365 reports in the Microsoft 365 admin center. For more information about the activity reports in the Microsoft 365 admin center, see [Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/activity-reports).

## Teams reporting reference

Here's a list of the Teams reports available in the Microsoft Teams admin center across different environments and an overview of some of the information that's available in each report.

We're continually improving the Teams reporting experience and adding features and functionality. Over time, we'll be building additional capabilities into the reports and adding new reports in the Microsoft Teams admin center.

## Make the user specific data anonymous

To make the identifiable information in usage reports anonymous, you have to be a Global administrator. The Global administrator can hide identifiable information (using MD5 hashes) such as display name, group name, email, and AAD ID in the report and its export.

1. In Microsoft 365 admin center, go to the **Settings** \> **Org Settings**, and under **Services** tab, choose **Reports**.
    
2. Select **Reports**, and then choose to **Display concealed user, group, and site names in all reports**. This setting gets applied both to the usage reports in Microsoft 365 admin center as well as Teams admin center.
  
3. Select **Save changes**.

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling this setting will de-identify user, group, and site name information in the [Teams user activity report](user-activity-report.md), [Teams device usage report](device-usage-report.md), and [Teams usage report](teams-usage-report.md). Starting September 1, 2021, this setting is enabled by default for everyone as part of our ongoing commitment to help protect important information and enable companies to support their local privacy laws.
>
>This setting also applies to Microsoft 365 usage reports in Microsoft 365 admin center, Microsoft Graph, and Power BI.
