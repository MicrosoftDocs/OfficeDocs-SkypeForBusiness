# Microsoft Teams information protection license report


Teams information protection license report gives API usage insight of [Microsoft Graph APIs that have license and payment requirements](/graph/teams-licenses). This report highlights all the apps that are using these APIs in [model=A](/graph/teams-licenses#modela-requirements). It does not show usage when APIs are used in [model=B](/graph/teams-licenses#modelb-requirements) or [evaluation mode](/graph/teams-licenses#evaluation-mode-default-requirements).

## Make the user-specific data anonymous

To make the data in the Teams user activity report anonymous, you have to be a global administrator. This will hide identifiable information such as display name, email, and Azure AD ID in reports and their exports.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Settings** \> **Org Settings**, and under the **Services** tab, choose **Reports**.
    
2. Select **Reports**, and then choose to **Display anonymous identifiers**. This setting gets applied both to the usage reports in the Microsoft 365 admin center and the Teams admin center.
  
3. Select **Save changes**.
