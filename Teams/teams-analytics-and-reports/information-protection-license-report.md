# Microsoft Teams information protection license report

The Teams information protection license report gives insight into apps that have [subscribed](/graph/api/resources/subscription?view=graph-rest-1.0) to [change notification](/graph/api/resources/webhooks?view=graph-rest-1.0) events to listen to created, updated, or deleted messages at tenant level (that is, /teams/getAllMessage or /chats/getAllMessages). A change notification corresponding to the message is sent successfully only when the user has the [required license](/graph/teams-licenses).  You can see how many change notifications was triggered by a given user.


## View the information protection license report

You must be a Teams service admin to make these changes. See [Use Teams administrator roles to manage Teams](../using-admin-roles.md) to read about getting admin roles and permissions.

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, select **Analytics & reports** > **Usage reports**. On the **View reports** tab, under **Report**, select **Information Protection License**.
2. Under **Date range**, select a range.
3. Under **Apps**, select an app and then select **Run report**.

|**2**   |App name will display a list of all apps that have subscribed to change notification events of messages in the last n days as selected in the date range. |
|**3**   |The table gives you a breakdown of usage per user for the selected app.<ul><li>**Display name** is the display name of the user. Select the display name to go to the user's details page in the Microsoft Teams admin center.</li><li>**Has Required License** is yes if the user has one of the required licenses as defined (here)[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/teams-licenses]. If the user does not have the required license, the _Assign license_ link is displayed which navigated to the user's license detail page in the Microsoft admin center (**Users** > **Active Users** > select username).</li><li>**License Protected Events** is the number of unique change notification events sent to the app against a message which was created, updated or deleted by that user.</li></ul> |

|**5**   |Export the report to a CSV file for offline analysis. Select **Export to Excel**, and then the **Downloads** tab. Select **Download** to download the report when it's ready. When you view the report in Excel, you'll also see an **Id** and **email** column, which represents the User ID and email address of the user. |

## Make the user-specific data anonymous

To make the data in the Teams user activity report anonymous, you have to be a global administrator. This will hide identifiable information such as display name, email, and Azure AD ID in reports and their exports.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Settings** \> **Org Settings**, and under the **Services** tab, choose **Reports**.
    
2. Select **Reports**, and then choose to **Display anonymous identifiers**. This setting gets applied both to the usage reports in the Microsoft 365 admin center and the Teams admin center.
  
3. Select **Save changes**.
