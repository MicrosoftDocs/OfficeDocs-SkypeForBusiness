# Microsoft Teams PSTN usage report

The Teams PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) and SMS usage report in the Microsoft Teams admin center gives you an overview of calling and audio conferencing activity in your organization. You can view detailed calling activity for Calling Plans if you use Microsoft as your telephony carrier and for Direct Routing if you use your own telephony carrier.

The **Calling Plans** tab shows information including the number of minutes that users spent in inbound and outbound PSTN calls and the cost of these calls. The **Direct Routing** tab shows you information including the SIP address and call start and end times. Use the information in this report to gain insight into PSTN usage in your organization and help you to investigate, plan, and make business decisions.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a Telstra or Softbank calling plan, you will not see any call detail records in the PSTN usage report. Please contact Telstra or Softbank for your reporting needs. 

## View the PSTN usage report

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, click **Analytics & reports** > **Usage reports**. On the **View reports** tab, under **Report**, select **PSTN and SMS (preview) usage**.
2. Under **Date range**, select a predefined range of 7 or 28 days, or set a custom range, and then select **Run report**.

## Interpret the report

#### Caller/Callee fields considerations

Depending on the call direction, the Caller or Callee names can contain non-E164 numbers.

These fields can come from the customer SBC(s). There are three formats that the SBC can send to Direct Routing: E.164 numbers, non-E.164 numbers, and strings.

- E.164 phone number from a user who has an E.164 number to a user who also has an E.164 number. 
- Call from a non-E.164 number. A user from a third-party PBX interconnected with Direct Routing makes a call to a Teams user. In this case, the caller number might be any non-E.164 number, for example +1001. 
- A spammer calls and doesn't present a number, only a name, for example "Internal Revenue Service". This string will be shown in the reports.

#### Phone number obfuscation

Per-country/region privacy requirements include the obfuscation of the external (not owned by the customer) phone numbers. The three or four last digits of the phone number are replaced with asterisks (+123 456789***). 

For incoming calls, the caller number is obfuscated, for outgoing calls, the callee number is obfuscated. Note that these rules apply to the PSTN and Direct Routing reports in Tenant Admin Center, data export, and the PSTN call logs available via Microsoft Graph. Phone number obfuscation rules in other reports, such as Call Analytics and Call Quality Dashboard, may differ.

The obfuscation is based on the organization's location (country/region). Full phone numbers are shown for the countries/regions that are not listed in the following table:

| Country/Region | Number of obfuscation digits |
| :---: | :--- |
|BE – Belgium | 3 |
|CH – Switzerland | 4 |
|DE – Germany | 3 |
|DK – Denmark | 3 |
|ES – Spain | 3 |
|FI – Finland | 3 |
|FR – France | 4 |
|IT – Italy | 3 |
|NL – Netherlands | 3 |
|NO – Norway | 3 |
|SE – Sweden | 3 |

#### About Shared Correlation ID

The Shared Correlation ID only exists in the exported Excel file that you download and indicates that two or more calls are related. 
The following explains the different scenarios, and when Shared Correlation ID is present.

1.    PSTN User 1 on a PSTN endpoint called Teams User 1 on Teams client, call type Dr_In, correlation ID 57f28917-42k5-4c0c-9433-79734873f2ac, no shared correlation ID.
2.    Teams User 1 on Teams client called PSTN User 1 on a PSTN endpoint, call type Dr_Out 2c12b8ca-62eb-4c48-b68d-e451f518ff4, no shared correlation ID.
3.    PSTN User 1 on a PSTN endpoint called a Teams User 2 on Teams client, call type Dr_In f45e9a25-9f94-46e7-a457-84f5940efde9, shared correlation ID f45e9a25-9f94-46e7-a457-84f5940efde9.
4.    Existing call 3 with correlation ID "f45e9a25-9f94-46e7-a457-84f5940efde9". PSTN User 1 in a call with Teams User 2. Teams User 2 transferred (blind or consultative) a call to Teams or PSTN User, call type Dr_Out_User_Transfer 45a1da7c-9e97-481a-8a05-3fe19a9a77e0, shared correlation ID f45e9a25-9f94-46e7-a457-84f5940efde9.

#### Data retention

Per-country regulatory requirements specify data retention of detailed call records. Per-country retention period in days is listed in the following table:

| Country | PSTN Calling Plans | Direct Routing |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| CA – Canada | 150 | 150 |
| CH – Switzerland | 365 | 365 |
| DE – Germany | 365 | 100 |
| DK – Denmark | 365 | 365 |
| FI – Finland | 365 | 365 |
| FR – France | 365 | 365 |
| IT – Italy | 730 | 730 |
| KR – South Korea | 365 | 365 |
| MX – Mexico | 720 | 730 |
| NL – Netherlands | 180 | 180 |
| NO – Norway | 150 | 150 |
| SE – Sweden | 180 | 180 |
| UK – United Kingdom | 450 | 450 |
| All other countries | 365 | 150 |

Note that these rules apply to the PSTN and Direct Routing reports in Tenant Admin Center, data export, and the PSTN and Direct Routing call logs available via Microsoft Graph. Data retention in other reports, such as Call Analytics and Call Quality Dashboard, may differ.

The retention period is based on the user's location (country). If the tenant administrator does not set a user's location, the default value for the location of a user is the location of the tenant.

## Exporting the reports
Click **Export to Excel**, and then on the **Downloads** tab, click **Download** to download the report when it's ready. Export process can take from a few seconds to several minutes to complete, depending on the quantity of the data.

This exports data of all users and enables you to do simple sorting and filtering for further analysis. Exported files contain additional fields that are not available in the online report. These can be used for troubleshooting and automated workflows.

 You'll receive a zip file named "**Calls.Export.`[identifier]`.zip**", with the identifier being a unique ID for the export that can be used for troubleshooting.

If you have both Calling Plans and Direct Routing, the exported file may contain data for both products. PSTN usage report file will have filename "**PSTN.calls.`[UTC date]`.csv**" and Direct Routing "**DirectRouting.calls.`[UTC date]`.csv**".

 In addition to PSTN and Direct Routing files, the archive contains file "**parameters.json**", with the selected export time range and capabilities.

Exported files are in Comma Separated Values (CSV) format, compliant with [RFC 4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) standard. The files can be opened in Excel or any other standards-compliant editor without requiring any transformations.

The first row of the CSV contains column names. All dates are UTC and in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format.

### Exported PSTN usage report

 You can export data up to one year from the current date unless country/region-specific regulations prohibit retention of the data for 12 months.
