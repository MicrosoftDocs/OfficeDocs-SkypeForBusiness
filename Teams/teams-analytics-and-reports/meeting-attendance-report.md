# Microsoft Teams meeting attendance report

Meeting organizers can view and download a meeting attendance report. Find this report in the **Participants** pane of the meeting, by clicking the download arrow as shown below. You can download the report as a .CSV file (text format).

For education tenants, this report is useful to track student attendance in online classes. For example, the teacher can download the attendance report at the start of class as a simple way to do a "roll call." To learn more, read [Download attendance reports in Teams](https://support.office.com/article/download-attendance-reports-in-teams-ae7cf170-530c-47d3-84c1-3aedac74d310).

As an admin, you control whether meeting organizers can download meeting attendance reports by setting a Teams meeting policy. By default, the ability to download the report is turned on. For steps on how to turn off this feature, see [Meeting policy settings - Allow engagement report](../meeting-policies-in-teams-general.md#engagement-report).

If meeting organizers need access to more meeting attendance data than they get from the report available within the meeting, you can assign the *Report reader* role so they can access the Teams admin reports themselves. To learn about this, read [Who can access the Teams activity reports](../teams-activity-reports.md#who-can-access-the-teams-activity-reports).
