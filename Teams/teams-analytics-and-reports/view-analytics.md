# View analytics in Teams

In Microsoft Teams, users can view analytics for teams and channels that they are part of. This information gives users insight into usage patterns and activity on their teams. Users can see data such as the number of active users, posts, replies, and more at three levels.

- **Cross-team analytics** gives users a broad overview of usage data for all teams that they are a member or owner of in a single list view.
- **Per-team analytics** gives users a more granular view, showing usage data for a specific team.
- **Per-channel analytics** gives users an even more granular view, showing usage data for a specific channel.

Users can filter any of these views to see data for a specified time period.

## View cross-team analytics

1. In Teams, at the bottom of the teams list, next to **Join or create a team**, click **Manage teams**.
2. Click the **Analytics** tab.
3. Select a date range to show usage data for all teams that you're a member or owner of.

> We define active users as users who perform an intentional action in the desktop client, mobile client, and web client. Examples of an intentional action include starting a chat, placing a call, sharing a file, editing a document within teams, participating in a meeting, and so on. We strip out passive actions like auto boot, minimizing a screen, or closing the app. We also de-dupe all actions across a single user ID.
