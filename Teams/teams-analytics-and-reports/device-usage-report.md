# Microsoft Teams device usage report

The Teams device usage report in the Microsoft Teams admin center provides you with information about how users connect to Teams. You can use the report to see the devices that are used across your organization, including how many use Teams from their mobile devices when on-the-go.  

## View the device usage report


You must be either a global admin, global reader, or Teams service admin to view reports in Teams admin center. See [Use Teams administrator roles to manage Teams](../using-admin-roles.md) to read about getting admin roles and permissions.


1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, click **Analytics & reports** > **Usage reports**. On the **View reports** tab, under **Report**, select **Teams device usage**.
2. Under **Date range**, select a range, and then click **Run report**.

## Make the user specific data anonymous

To make the data in Teams user activity report anonymous, you have to be a global administrator. The global administrator can hide identifiable information (using MD5 hashes) such as display name, group name, email, and AAD ID in the report and its export.

1. In Microsoft 365 admin center, go to the **Settings** \> **Org Settings**, and under **Services** tab, choose **Reports**.
    
2. Select **Reports**, and then choose **Display concealed user, group, and site names in all reports**. This setting gets applied both to the usage reports in Microsoft 365 admin center as well as Teams admin center.
  
3. Select **Save changes**.

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling this setting will de-identify user, group and site name information in the [Teams user activity report](user-activity-report.md), [Teams device usage report](device-usage-report.md), and [Teams usage report](teams-usage-report.md). Starting September 1, 2021, this setting is enabled by default for everyone as part of our ongoing commitment to help protect important information and enable companies to support their local privacy laws. 
>
>This setting also applies to Microsoft 365 usage reports in Microsoft 365 admin center, Microsoft Graph, and Power BI.
