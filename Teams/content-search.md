Use Content Search in Microsoft Teams
=====================================

Content Search provides an ad-hoc way to query Microsoft Teams information spanning Exchange, SharePoint Online, and OneDrive for Business.

To learn more, read [Content Search in Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/Run-a-Content-Search-in-the-Office-365-Security-Compliance-Center-61852fd9-fe8a-4880-a339-cb19ed3bff4a).

For example, using **Content Search** against your Manufacturing Specs mailbox and Manufacturing Specs SharePoint site, you can search against Teams channel conversations from Exchange, file uploads and modifications from SharePoint Online, and OneNote changes.

You can also add query criteria to the **Content Search** to narrow the results returned. In the above example, you can look for content where the keywords “**New Factory Specs”** were used.

> [!TIP]
> After adding search conditions, you can export a report or the data to your computer for analysis.
