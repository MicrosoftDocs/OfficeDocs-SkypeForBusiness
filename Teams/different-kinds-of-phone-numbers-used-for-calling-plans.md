# Different kinds of phone numbers used for Calling Plans

Microsoft Teams uses different telephone number types depending on the purpose for which you want to use the telephone number. Teams uses **subscriber** numbers, which can be assigned to users in your organization, and **service** numbers, which are assigned to services such as Audio Conferencing, auto attendants, or call queues. Service phone numbers have a *higher concurrent call capacity*  than subscriber (or user) numbers. Service phone numbers are available but will vary by country/region and the type of number (whether it's a toll or toll-free number). If you need additional or other number types other than those numbers seen in the Microsoft Teams admin center, you can submit a phone number request to the Microsoft telephone number service desk.
  
- **Subscriber numbers**
    
    Subscriber numbers are assigned to users, and there are two kinds:
    
  - **Geographic numbers** Geographic numbers have a relationship to a geographic area and are the most common. For example, geographic telephone numbers in most cases can only be used within a certain address, city, state, or region of the country.
    
  - **Non-geographic numbers** Non-geographic numbers are national numbers that don't have a relationship to a geographic area within a country/region. For example, non-geographic numbers often have the same cost when calling the number from anywhere within the country/region. Also, some countries, such as Denmark, only have non-geographic numbers available.
    
- **Service numbers** Service numbers are available in several different number types, and availability does vary by country/region.
    
  - **Toll service numbers**
    
    Toll service numbers may incur a toll cost to the caller, and there are two kinds:
    
      - **Geographic numbers** Geographic numbers have a relationship to a geographic area. For example, geographic telephone numbers in most cases can only be used within a certain address, city, state, or region of the country.
        
      - **Non-geographic numbers** Non-geographic numbers are national numbers that don't have a relationship to a geographic area within a country/region. For example, non-geographic numbers often have the same cost when calling the number from anywhere within the country/region.
   
  - **Toll-free service numbers** These service numbers don't typically incur a toll cost to the caller. Teams provides national toll-free numbers in over 60 countries/regions.
    
    > [!CAUTION]
    > Some countries/regions and originating number types, such as calls originating from mobile phones, may in some cases incur a toll cost to the caller.
