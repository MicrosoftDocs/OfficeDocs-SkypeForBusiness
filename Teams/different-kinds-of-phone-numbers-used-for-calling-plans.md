# Types of phone numbers

Microsoft Teams uses different telephone number types depending on the purpose for which you want to use the phone number. 

Teams uses **user** numbers, which can be assigned to users in your organization, and **service** numbers, which are assigned to services such as Audio Conferencing, auto attendants, or call queues. Service phone numbers have a *higher concurrent call capacity*  than user numbers. Service phone numbers are available but will vary by country/region and the type of number (whether it's a toll or toll-free number). If you need additional or other number types other than those numbers seen in the Teams admin center, you can submit a phone number request to the [TNS Service Desk](manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/contact-tns-service-desk.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that there are regions and country limitations for the availability of non-geographic numbers.
> If you have further questions or need to get more phone numbers, [contact the TNS Service Desk](manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/contact-tns-service-desk.md).
  
### User numbers
    
User numbers are assigned to users, and there are two kinds:
    
- **Geographic numbers:** Geographic numbers have a relationship to a geographic area and are the most common. For example, geographic phone numbers in most cases can only be used within a certain address, city, state, or region of the country.
    
- **Non-geographic numbers:** Non-geographic numbers are national numbers that don't have a relationship to a geographic area within a country/region. For example, non-geographic numbers often have the same cost when calling the number from anywhere within the country/region. Also, some countries, such as Denmark, only have non-geographic numbers available.
    
### Service numbers 

Service numbers are available in several different number types, and availability does vary by country/region.
    
#### Toll service numbers
    
Toll service numbers may incur a toll cost to the caller, and there are two kinds:
    
- **Geographic numbers:** Geographic numbers have a relationship to a geographic area. For example, geographic phone numbers in most cases can only be used within a certain address, city, state, or region of the country.
        
- **Non-geographic numbers:** Non-geographic numbers are national numbers that don't have a relationship to a geographic area within a country/region. For example, non-geographic numbers often have the same cost when calling the number from anywhere within the country/region.
   
#### Toll-free service numbers 

These service numbers don't typically incur a toll cost to the caller. Teams provides national toll-free numbers in over 60 countries/regions.
    
> [!CAUTION]
> Some countries/regions and originating number types, such as calls originating from mobile phones, may in some cases incur a toll cost to the caller.
