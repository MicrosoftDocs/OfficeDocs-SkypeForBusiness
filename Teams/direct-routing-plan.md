# Plan Direct Routing

> [!Tip]
> Watch the following session to learn about the benefits of Direct Routing, how to plan for it, and how to deploy it: [Direct Routing in Microsoft Teams](https://aka.ms/teams-direct-routing)

Direct Routing lets you connect a supported, customer-provided Session Border Controller (SBC) to Phone System. With this capability, you can configure on-premises Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) connectivity with Microsoft Teams client, as shown in the following diagram: 

![Diagram showing configuration of on-premises PSTN connectivity.](media/PlanDirectRouting1-PSTNwithTeams.png "Configuration of on-premises PSTN connectivity with Microsoft Teams client")

  > [!NOTE]
  > Skype for Business Online also lets you pair a customer-provided SBC, but this requires an on-premises Skype for Business Server deployment or a special edition of Skype for Business, called Cloud Connector, in between the SBC and the Microsoft Cloud. This scenario is known as hybrid voice. In contrast, Direct Routing allows a direct connection between the supported SBC and the Microsoft Cloud.

> [!Important]
> Cloud Connector Edition will retire July 31, 2021 along with Skype for Business Online. Once your organization has upgraded to Teams, learn how to connect your on-premises telephony network to Teams using [Direct Routing](direct-routing-landing-page.md). 

With Direct Routing, you can connect your SBC to almost any telephony trunk or interconnect with third-party PSTN equipment. Direct Routing enables you to: 

- Use virtually any PSTN trunk with Phone System. 

- Configure interoperability between customer-owned telephony equipment, such as a third-party private branch exchange (PBX), analog devices, and Teams.

Microsoft also offers all-in-the-cloud voice solutions, such as Calling Plan. However, a hybrid voice solution might be best for your organization if: 

- Microsoft Calling Plan is not available in your country. 

- Your organization requires connection to third-party analog devices, call centers, and so on. 

- Your organization has an existing contract with a PSTN carrier.

Direct Routing also supports users who have the additional license for the Microsoft Calling Plan. For more information, see [Phone System and Calling Plans](calling-plan-landing-page.md). 

With Direct Routing, when users participate in a scheduled conference, the dial-in number is provided by Microsoft Audio Conferencing service, which requires proper licensing.  When dialing out, the Microsoft Audio Conferencing service places the call using online calling capabilities, which requires proper licensing. (Note that if a user does not have a Microsoft Audio Conferencing license, the call routes through Direct Routing.) For more information, see [Online Meetings with Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/online-meetings). 
 
Planning your deployment of Direct Routing is key to a successful implementation. This article describes infrastructure and licensing requirements and provides information about SBC connectivity:

## Infrastructure requirements
The infrastructure requirements for the supported SBCs, domains, and other network connectivity requirements to deploy Direct Routing are listed in the following table:  

|Infrastructure requirement|You need the following|
|:--- |:--- |
|Session Border Controller (SBC)|A supported SBC. For more information, see [Supported SBCs](#supported-session-border-controllers-sbcs).|
|Telephony trunks connected to the SBC|One or more telephony trunks connected to the SBC. On one end, the SBC connects to Phone System through Direct Routing. The SBC can also connect to third-party telephony entities, such as PBXs, Analog Telephony Adapters, and so on. Any PSTN connectivity option connected to the SBC will work. (For configuration of the PSTN trunks to the SBC, refer to the SBC vendors or trunk providers.)|

## Licensing and other requirements 

Users of Direct Routing must have the following licenses assigned in Microsoft 365: 

- Microsoft Phone System
- Microsoft Teams + Skype for Business Plan 2, if included in licensing
- Microsoft Audio Conferencing (Read the notes and the paragraph below for specific examples about when this license is required.)

> [!NOTE]
> Skype for Business Plan should not be removed from any licensing agreement where it is included. 
> 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> GCC High and DoD users should disable any Audio Conferencing licensing included in G5 and wait to enable any Audio Conferencing until Direct Routing has been fully configured. Users should have dial-in phone numbers configured and a working dial pad before enabling Audio Conferencing licenses. See [Audio Conferencing with Direct Routing for GCC High and DoD](./audio-conferencing-with-direct-routing-for-gcch-and-dod.md) for more details.


> [!IMPORTANT]
>  If you want to add external participants to scheduled meetings, either by dialing out to them or by providing the dial-in number, the audio conferencing license is required.
>  For GCC High and DoD, do not assign an Audio Conferencing license for G5 users. For G3 users, do not assign an Audio Conferencing license until Direct Routing is fully configured and the user has a working dial pad.


### Ad hoc call escalation and Audio Conferencing license

A Teams user can start a one-on-one Teams-to-PSTN or Teams-to-Teams call and add a PSTN participant to it. This scenario is called an ad hoc conference. The path that the call takes depends on whether the user who escalates the call has a Microsoft Audio Conferencing license assigned or not:

- **If the Teams user who escalates the call has a Microsoft Audio Conferencing license assigned**, the escalation happens through the Microsoft Audio Conferencing service. The remote PSTN participant who is invited to the existing call receives a notification about the incoming call and sees the number of the Microsoft bridge assigned to the Teams user who initiated the escalation.

- **If the Teams user who escalates the call does not have the Microsoft Audio Conferencing license assigned**, the escalation happens through a Session Border Controller connected to the Direct Routing interface. The remote PSTN participant who is invited to the call receives a notification about the incoming call and sees the number of the Teams user who initiated the escalation. The specific SBC used for the escalation is defined by the routing policy of the user. 

You must ensure the following:
 
- CsOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy is assigned to the user. 

- Allow Private Calling is enabled at the tenant level for Microsoft Teams. 

Direct Routing also supports users who are licensed for Microsoft Calling Plan. Phone System with Calling Plan can route some calls using the Direct Routing interface. However, the users' phone numbers must be either acquired online or ported to Microsoft.  

Mixing Calling Plan and Direct Routing connectivity for the same user is optional, but could be useful. For example, when the user is assigned a Microsoft Calling Plan but wants to route some calls using the SBC. One of the most common scenarios is calls to third-party PBXs.  With third-party PBXs, all calls, except calls to the phones connected to that PBX, are routed using Microsoft Calling Plan, but calls to the phones connected to third-party PBXs go to the SBC, and therefore stay within the enterprise network and not the PSTN. 

For more information about Phone System licensing, see [Get the most from Office](https://products.office.com/compare-all-microsoft-office-products?tab=2) and [Plan Options](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-plan-options) and [Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](./teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md). 

## Supported end points 

You can use as an end point:

- Any Teams client. 

- Common Area Phones. See [Set up Common Area Phones for Microsoft Teams](./set-up-common-area-phones.md). You do not need a Calling Plan license when setting up a Common Area Phone with Direct Routing.

- Skype for Business 3PIP phones. See [Skype for Business phones (3PIP) support with Microsoft Teams](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-Teams-Blog/Skype-for-Business-phones-3PIP-support-with-Microsoft-Teams/ba-p/789351)


## SBC domain names

The SBC domain name must be from one of the names registered in Domains of the tenant. You cannot use the \*.onmicrosoft.com tenant for the FQDN name of the SBC.

The following table shows examples of DNS names registered for the tenant, whether the name can be used as an FQDN for the SBC, and examples of valid FQDN names:

|DNS name|Can be used for SBC FQDN|Examples of FQDN names|
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
contoso.com|Yes|**Valid names:**<br/>sbc1.contoso.com<br/>ssbcs15.contoso.com<br/>europe.contoso.com|
|contoso.onmicrosoft.com|No|Using *.onmicrosoft.com domains is not supported for SBC names

Assume you want to use a new domain name. For example, your tenant has contoso.com as a domain name registered in your tenant, and you want to use sbc1.sip.contoso.com. Before you can pair an SBC with the name sbc1.sip.contoso.com, you must register the domain name sip.contoso.com in Domains in your tenant. If you try pairing an SBC with sbc1.sip.contoso.com before registering the domain name, you will get the following error: "Cannot use the "sbc1.sip.contoso.com" domain as it was not configured for this tenant."
After you add the domain name, you also need to create a user with UPN user@sip.contoso.com and assign a Teams license. It might take up to 24 hours to fully provision the domain name after it is added to Domains of your tenant, a user with a new name is created, and a license is assigned to the user. 

It is possible that a company might have several SIP address spaces in one tenant. For example, a company might have contoso.com as a SIP address space and fabrikam.com as the second SIP address space. Some users have address user@contoso.com and some users have address user@fabrikam.com. 

The SBC only needs one FQDN and can service users from any address space in the paired tenant. For example,  an SBC with the name sbc1.contoso.com can receive and send the PSTN traffic for users with addresses user@contoso.com and user@fabrikam.com as long as these SIP address spaces are registered in the same tenant.  

 > [!NOTE]
 > SBC FQDN in Azure Communication Services direct routing must be different from SBC FQDN in Teams Direct Routing.
  
## Public trusted certificate for the SBC

Microsoft recommends that you request the certificate for the SBC by generating a certification signing request (CSR). For specific instructions on generating a CSR for an SBC, refer to the interconnection instructions or documentation provided by your SBC vendors. 

> [!NOTE]
> Most Certificate Authorities (CAs) require the private key size to be at least 2048. Keep this in mind when generating the CSR.

The certificate needs to have the SBC FQDN as the common name (CN) or the subject alternative name (SAN) field.

Alternatively, Direct Routing  supports a wildcard in the CN and/or SAN, and the wildcard needs to conform to standard [RFC HTTP Over TLS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818#section-3.1). 
An example would be using \*.contoso.com which would match the SBC FQDN sbc.contoso.com, but wouldn't match with sbc.test.contoso.com.

Direct Routing SIP interface will only trust certificates that are signed by Certificate Authorities (CAs) that are part of the Microsoft Trusted Root Certificate Program. Make sure that your SBC certificate is signed by a CA that is part of the program and that the Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension of your certificate includes Server Authentication.
Learn more:
[Program Requirements - Microsoft Trusted Root Program](/security/trusted-root/program-requirements)
  
[Included CA Certificate List](https://ccadb-public.secure.force.com/microsoft/IncludedCACertificateReportForMSFT)
  
 For Direct Routing in Office 365 GCCH and DoD environments, the certificate needs to be generated by one of the following root certificate authorities:

- DigiCert Global Root CA
- DigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA

> [!NOTE]
> If Mutual TLS (MTLS) support is enabled for the Teams connection on the SBC, then you must install the Baltimore CyberTrust Root and the DigiCert Global Root G2 certificates in the SBC Trusted Root Store of the Teams TLS context. (This is because the Microsoft service certificates use one of these two root certificates.) To download these root certificates, see [Office 365 Encryption chains](/microsoft-365/compliance/encryption-office-365-certificate-chains). For more details, see [Office TLS Certificate Changes](/microsoft-365/compliance/encryption-office-365-tls-certificates-changes).

## SIP Signaling: FQDNs 

Direct Routing is offered in the following environments:

- Microsoft 365 or Office 365
- Office 365 GCC
- Office 365 GCC High
- Office 365 DoD

Learn more about [Office 365 and US Government environments](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/office-365-us-government) such as GCC, GCC High, and DoD.

### Microsoft 365, Office 365, and Office 365 GCC environments

The connection points for Direct Routing are the following three FQDNs:

- **sip.pstnhub.microsoft.com** – Global FQDN – must be tried first. When the SBC sends a request to resolve this name, the Microsoft Azure DNS servers return an IP address pointing to the primary Azure datacenter assigned to the SBC. The assignment is based on performance metrics of the datacenters and geographical proximity to the SBC. The IP address returned corresponds to the primary FQDN.

- **sip2.pstnhub.microsoft.com** – Secondary FQDN – geographically maps to the second priority region.

- **sip3.pstnhub.microsoft.com** – Tertiary FQDN – geographically maps to the third priority region.

Placing these three FQDNs in order is required to:

- Provide optimal experience (less loaded and closest to the SBC datacenter assigned by querying the first FQDN).

- Provide failover when connection from an SBC is established to a datacenter that is experiencing a temporary issue. For more information, see [Failover mechanism](#failover-mechanism-for-sip-signaling) below.  

The FQDNs – sip.pstnhub.microsoft.com, sip2.pstnhub.microsoft.com and sip3.pstnhub.microsoft.com – will be resolved to IP addresses from the following subnets:

- 52.112.0.0/14
- 52.120.0.0/14

You need to open ports for all these IP address ranges in your firewall to allow incoming and outgoing traffic to and from the addresses for signaling.

### Office GCC DoD environment

The connection point for Direct Routing is the following FQDN:

**sip.pstnhub.dod.teams.microsoft.us** – Global FQDN. As the Office 365 DoD environment exists only in the US data centers, there is no secondary and tertiary FQDNs.

The FQDN sip.pstnhub.dod.teams.microsoft.us will be resolved to an IP address from the following subnet:

- 52.127.64.0/21

You need to open ports for all these IP addresses in your firewall to allow incoming and outgoing traffic to and from the addresses for signaling.

### Office 365 GCC High environment

The connection point for Direct Routing is the following FQDN:

**sip.pstnhub.gov.teams.microsoft.us** – Global FQDN. As the GCC High environment exists only in the US data centers, there is no secondary and tertiary FQDNs.

The FQDN sip.pstnhub.gov.teams.microsoft.us will be resolved to an IP address from the following subnet:

- 52.127.88.0/21

You need to open ports for all these IP addresses in your firewall to allow incoming and outgoing traffic to and from the addresses for signaling.

## SIP Signaling: Ports

You must use the following ports for Microsoft 365 or Office 365 environments where Direct Routing is offered:

- Microsoft 365 or Office 365
- Office 365 GCC
- Office 365 GCC High
- Office 365 DoD

|Traffic|From|To|Source port|Destination port|
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
|SIP/TLS|SIP Proxy|SBC|1024 – 65535|Defined on the SBC (For Office 365 GCC High/DoD only port 5061 must be used)|
SIP/TLS|SBC|SIP Proxy|Defined on the SBC|5061|
||||||

### Failover mechanism for SIP Signaling

The SBC makes a DNS query to resolve sip.pstnhub.microsoft.com. Based on the SBC location and the datacenter performance metrics, the primary datacenter is selected. If the primary datacenter experiences an issue, the SBC will try the sip2.pstnhub.microsoft.com, which resolves to the second assigned datacenter, and, in the rare case that datacenters in two regions are not available, the SBC retries the last FQDN (sip3.pstnhub.microsoft.com), which provides the tertiary datacenter IP.

The table below summarizes the relationships between primary, secondary, and tertiary datacenters:

|If the primary datacenter is|EMEA|NOAM|ASIA|
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
|The secondary datacenter (sip2.pstnhub.microsoft.com)|US|EU|US|
|The tertiary datacenter (sip3.pstnhub.microsoft.com)|ASIA|ASIA|EU|

## Media traffic: Port ranges
Note that the requirements below apply if you want to deploy Direct Routing without Media Bypass. For firewall requirements for Media Bypass, please refer to [Plan for media bypass with Direct Routing](./direct-routing-plan-media-bypass.md).

The media traffic flows to and from a separate service in the Microsoft Cloud. The IP address ranges for Media traffic are as follows.

### Microsoft 365, Office 365, and Office 365 GCC environments

- 52.112.0.0/14 (IP addresses from 52.112.0.1 to 52.115.255.254).
- 52.120.0.0/14 (IP addresses from 52.120.0.1 to 52.123.255.254).

### Office 365 DoD environment

- 52.127.64.0/21

### Office 365 GCC High environment

- 52.127.88.0/21

### Port range (applicable to all environments)
The port range of the Media Processors is shown in the following table: 

|Traffic|From|To|Source port|Destination port|
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
|UDP/SRTP|Media Processor|SBC|3478-3481 and 49152 – 53247|Defined on the SBC|
|UDP/SRTP|SBC|Media Processor|Defined on the SBC|3478-3481 and 49152 – 53247|

  > [!NOTE]
  > Microsoft recommends at least two ports per concurrent call on the SBC.


## Media traffic: Media processors geography

The media traffic flows via components called media processors. Media processors are placed in the same datacenters as SIP proxies:

- NOAM (US South Central, two in US West and US East datacenters)
- Europe (UK South, France Central, Amsterdam and Dublin datacenters)
- Asia (Singapore datacenter)
- Japan (JP East and West datacenters)
- Australia (AU East and Southeast datacenters)
- LATAM (Brazil South)
- Africa (South Africa North)

## Media traffic: Codecs

### Leg between SBC and Cloud Media Processor or Microsoft Teams client

Applies to both media bypass case and non-bypass cases.

The Direct Routing interface on the leg between the Session Border Controller and Cloud Media Processor (without media bypass) or between the Teams client and the SBC (if Media Bypass enabled) can use the following codecs:

- Non-Media bypass (SBC to Cloud Media Processor): SILK, G.711, G.722, G.729
- Media Bypass (SBC to Teams client):  SILK, G.711, G.722, G.729

You can force use of the specific codec on the Session Border Controller by excluding undesirable codecs from the offer.

### Leg between Microsoft Teams Client and Cloud Media Processor

Applies to non-media bypass case only. With Media Bypass, the media flows directly between the Teams client and the SBC.

On the leg between the Cloud Media Processor and Microsoft Teams client, either SILK or G.722 is used. The codec choice on this leg is based on Microsoft algorithms, which take into consideration multiple parameters. 

  > [!NOTE]
  > Media re-targeting is not supported. During a Direct Routing call, if the SBC sends a new media IP to Teams Direct Routing, although it's negotiated in the SIP signaling, the media is never sent to the new IP address from Teams Direct Routing.

## Supported Session Border Controllers (SBCs)

Microsoft only supports certified SBCs to pair with Direct Routing. Because Enterprise Voice is critical for businesses, Microsoft runs intensive tests with the selected SBCs, and works with the SBC vendors to ensure the two systems are compatible. 

Devices that have been validated are listed as Certified for Teams Direct Routing. The certified devices are guaranteed to work in all scenarios. 

For more information about supported SBCs, see [Session Border Controllers certified for Direct Routing](direct-routing-border-controllers.md).

## Support Boundaries
Microsoft only supports Phone System with Direct Routing when used with certified devices. In case of issues, you must contact your SBC vendor's customer support first. If needed, the SBC vendor will escalate the issue to Microsoft via internal channels. Microsoft reserves the right to reject support cases where a non-certified device is connected to Phone System through Direct Routing. If Microsoft determines that a customer's Direct Routing issue is with a vendor's SBC device, the customer will need to re-engage the SBC vendor for support.
