# Plan Direct Routing

Microsoft Phone System Direct Routing lets you connect a supported, customer-provided Session Border Controller (SBC) to Microsoft Phone System.  With this capability, for example, you can configure on-premises PSTN connectivity with Microsoft Teams client, as shown in the following diagram: 

![Shows configuration of on-premises PSTN connectivity with Microsoft Teams client](media/PlanDirectRouting1-PSTNwithTeams.png)

  > [!NOTE]
  > Skype for Business Online also lets you pair a customer-provided SBC, but this requires an on-premises Skype for Business Server deployment or a special edition of Skype for Business, called Cloud Connector, in between the SBC and the Microsoft Cloud. This scenario is known as hybrid voice. In contrast, Direct Routing allows a direct connection between the supported SBC and the Microsoft Cloud. 

With Direct Routing, you can connect your SBC to almost any telephony trunk or interconnect with third-party Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) equipment. Direct Routing enables you to: 

- Use virtually any PSTN trunk with Microsoft Phone System. 
- Configure interoperability between customer-owned telephony equipment, such as a third-party private branch exchange (PBX), analog devices, and Microsoft Phone System.

Microsoft also offers all-in-the-cloud voice solutions, such as Calling Plan.  However, a hybrid voice solution might be best for your organization if: 

- Microsoft Calling Plan is not available in your country. 
- Your organization requires connection to third-party analog devices, call centers, and so on. 
- Your organization has an existing contract with a PSTN carrier.

Direct Routing also supports users who have the additional license for the Microsoft Calling Plan. For more information, see [Calling Plans in Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/skypeforbusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365) and [Licensing and other requirements](#licensing-and-other-requirements). 

With Direct Routing, when users participate in a scheduled conference, the dial-in number is provided by Microsoft Audio Conferencing service, which requires proper licensing.  When dialing out, the Microsoft Audio Conferencing service places the call using online calling capabilities, which requires proper licensing. (Note that dialing out does not route through Direct Routing.) For more information, see [Online Meetings with Teams](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/online-meeting-solutions). 
 
Planning your deployment of Direct Routing is key to a successful implementation. This article describes infrastructure and licensing requirements and provides information about SBC connectivity:

## Licensing and other requirements 

Users of Direct Routing must have the following licenses assigned in Office 365: 

- Microsoft Phone System 
- Microsoft Teams 
- Microsoft Audio Conferencing 

The Audio Conferencing license is required for adding external participants to scheduled meetings, either by dialing out to them or by providing the dial-in number. 
 
  > [!NOTE]
  > The E5 license includes both Phone System and Audio Conferencing.   

In addition, you must ensure the following:
 
- CsOnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy is assigned to the user. 
- Allow Private Calling is enabled at the tenant level for Microsoft Teams. 

Direct Routing also supports users who are licensed for Microsoft Calling Plan. Microsoft Phone System with Calling Plan can route some calls using the Direct Routing interface. However, the users' phone numbers must be either acquired online or ported to Microsoft.  

Mixing Calling Plan and Direct Routing connectivity for the same user is optional, but could be useful, for example, when the user is assigned a Microsoft Calling Plan but wants to route some calls via SBC. One of the most common scenarios are calls to third-party PBXs.  With third-party PBXs, all calls, except calls to the phones connected to that PBXs, are routed via Microsoft Calling Plan; but calls to the phones connected to third-party PBXs go to the SBC, therefore stay within the enterprise network and not to the PSTN. 

For more information about Phone System licensing, see [Get the most from Office with Office 365](https://products.office.com/compare-all-microsoft-office-products?tab=2) and [Office 365 Plan Options](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/office-365-plan-options.aspx). 

For more information about Phone System licensing, see [Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing). 

## SBC domain names

The SBC domain name must be from one of the names registered in “Domains” of the tenant. You cannot use the *.onmicrosoft.com tenant for the FQDN name of the SBC.

The following table shows examples of DNS names registered for the tenant, whether the name can be used as a FQDN for the SBC, and examples of valid FQDN names:

|**DNS name**|**Can be used for SBC FQDN**|**Examples of FQDN names**|
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
contoso.com|Yes|**Valid names:**<br/>sbc1.contoso.com<br/>ssbcs15.contoso.com<br/>europe.contoso.com|
|contoso.onmicrosoft.com|No|<br/>Using *.onmicrosoft.com domains is not supported for SBC names

Assume you want to use a new domain name. For example, your tenant has contoso.com as a domain name registered in your tenant, and you want to use sbc1.sip.contoso.com. Before you can pair an SBC with the name sbc1.sip.contoso.com, you must register the domain name sip.contoso.com in "Domains" in your tenant. If you try pairing an SBC with sbc1.sip.contoso.com before registering the domain name, you will get the following error: "Cannot use the "sbc1.sip.contoso.com" domain as it was not configured for this tenant."
After you add the domain name, you also need to create a user with UPN user@sip.contoso.com and assign a "Teams" license. It might take up to 24 hours to fully provision the domain name after it is added to "Domains" of your tenant, a user with a new name is created, and a license is assigned to the user. 

It is possible that a company might have several SIP address spaces in one tenant. For example, a company might have contoso.com as a SIP address space and fabrikam.com as the second SIP address space. Some users have address user@contoso.com and some users have address user@fabrikam.com. 

The SBC only needs one FQDN and can service users from any address space in the paired tenant. For example,  an SBC with the name sbc1.contoso.com can receive and send the PSTN traffic for users with addresses user@contoso.com and user@fabrikam.com as long as these SIP address spaces are registered in the same tenant.  

## Public trusted certificate for the SBC

Microsoft strongly recommends that you request the certificate for the SBC by generating a certification signing request (CSR). For specific instructions on generating a CSR for an SBC, refer to the interconnection instructions or documentation provided by your SBC vendors. 

  > [!NOTE]
  > Most Certificate Authorities (CAs) require the private key size to be at least 2048. Keep this in mind when generating the CSR.

The certificate needs to have the SBC FQDN in the subject, common name, or subject alternate name fields.

Alternatively, Direct Routing  supports a wildcard in the common name or SAN, and the wildcard needs to conform to standard [RFC HTTP Over TLS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818#section-3.1). 
An example would be using *.contoso.com in the SAN, which would match the SBC FQDN sbc.contoso.com, but wouldn’t match with sbc.test.contoso.com.

The certificate needs to be generated by one of the following root certificate authorities:

- AffirmTrust
- AddTrust External CA Root
- Baltimore CyberTrust Root
- Buypass
- Cybertrust
- Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority
- Comodo Secure Root CA
- Deutsche Telekom 
- DigiCert Global Root CA 
- Entrust
- GlobalSign
- Go Daddy
- GeoTrust
- Verisign, Inc. 
- Starfield 
- Symantec Enterprise Mobile Root for Microsoft 
- SwissSign
- Thawte Timestamping CA
- Trustwave
- TeliaSonera 
- T-Systems International GmbH (Deutsche Telekom)
- QuoVadis

Microsoft is working on adding additional certification authorities based on customer requests. 

## SIP Signaling: FQDNs and firewall ports 

The connection point for Direct Routing are the following three FQDNs:

- **sip.pstnhub.microsoft.com** – Global FQDN – must be tried first. When the SBC sends a request to resolve this name, the Microsoft Azure DNS servers return an IP address pointing to the primary Azure datacenter assigned to the SBC. The assignment is based on performance metrics of the datacenters and geographical proximity to the SBC. The IP address returned corresponds to the primary FQDN.
- **sip2.pstnhub.microsoft.com** – Secondary FQDN – geographically maps to the second priority region.
- **sip3.pstnhub.microsoft.com** – Tertiary FQDN – geographically maps to the third priority region.

Placing these three FQDNs in order is required to:

- Provide optimal experience (less loaded and closest to the SBC datacenter assigned by querying the first FQDN).
- Provide failover when connection from an SBC is established to a datacenter that is experiencing a temporary issue. For more information, see [Failover mechanism](#failover-mechanism-for-sip-signaling) below.  

The FQDNs – sip.pstnhub.microsoft.com, sip2.pstnhub.microsoft.com and sip3.pstnhub.microsoft.com – will be resolved to one of the following IP addresses:

- 52.114.148.0
- 52.114.132.46 
- 52.114.75.24 
- 52.114.76.76 
- 52.114.7.24 
- 52.114.14.70

You will need to open ports for all these IP addresses in your firewall to allow incoming and outgoing traffic to and from the addresses for signaling.  If your firewall supports DNS names, the FQDN sip-all.pstnhub.microsoft.com resolves to all the IP addresses above.  You must use the following ports:

|**Traffic**|**From**|**To**|**Source port**|**Destination port**|
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
|SIP/TLS|SIP Proxy|SBC|1024 – 65535|Defined on the SBC|
SIP/TLS|SBC|SIP Proxy|Defined on the SBC|5061|
||||||

### Failover mechanism for SIP Signaling

The SBC makes a DNS query to resolve sip.pstnhub.microsoft.com. Based on the SBC location and the datacenter performance metrics, the primary datacenter is selected. If the primary datacenter experiences an issue, the SBC will try the sip2.pstnhub.microsoft.com, which resolves to the second assigned datacenter, and, in the rare case that datacenters in two regions are not available, the SBC retries the last FQDN (sip3.pstnhub.microsoft.com), which provides the tertiary datacenter IP.

The table below summarizes the relationships between primary, secondary, and tertiary datacenters:

|**If the primary datacenter is**|**EMEA**|**NOAM**|**ASIA**|
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
|The secondary datacenter (sip2.pstnhub.microsoft.com)|US|EU|US|
|The tertiary datacenter (sip3.pstnhub.microsoft.com)|ASIA|ASIA|EU|
|||||

## Media traffic: Port ranges

The media traffic flows to and from a separate service in the Microsoft Cloud. The IP range for Media traffic:
- 52.112.0.0 /14 (IP addresses from 52.112.0.1 to 52.115.255.254).

The port range of the Media Processors is shown in the following table: 

|**Traffic**|**From**|**To**|**Source port**|**Destination port**|
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
|UDP/SRTP|Media Processor|SBC|49 152 – 53 247|Defined on the SBC|
|UDP/SRTP|SBC|Media Processor|Defined on the SBC|49 152 – 53 247|
|

  > [!NOTE]
  > Microsoft  recommends at least two ports per concurrent call on the SBC.

## Supported Session Border Controllers (SBCs)

Microsoft only supports the certified SBC to pair with Direct Routing. Because Enterprise Voice is critical for business, Microsoft runs intensive tests with the selected SBCs, and works with the SBC vendors to ensure the two systems are compatible. 

Devices that have been validated are listed as Certified for Teams Direct Routing. The certified devices are guaranteed to work in all scenarios. There is also a joint support process between Microsoft and the SBC vendors established.  

The following vendors are in the process of being certified:
- [AudioCodes](https://www.audiocodes.com/solutions-products/products/products-for-microsoft-365/direct-routing-for-Microsoft-Teams)
- Ribbon Communications (formerly Sonus):
   - [SBC Edge series](https://support.sonus.net/display/UXDOC70/Best+Practice+-+Configuring+SBC+Edge+1000+-+2000+for+Microsoft+Teams+Direct+Routing)
   - [SBC Core Series](https://support.sonus.net/display/IOT/PBXs+-+SBC+5k7kSWe)
- ThinkTel: ThinkTel does not sell the SBCs to the enterprises but their SBC is being certified.
