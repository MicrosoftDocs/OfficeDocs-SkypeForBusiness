The first approval created from the Approvals app will trigger the provisioning of the Approval Solution in the default Common Data Service (CDS) environment. Approvals created from the Approvals app will be stored in the default CDS environment.

This article describes the Approvals app requirements and roles.

## Security

From the Teams Approvals app, users have access to create new Approvals and view Approvals that they have sent and received. Users won't have access to Approvals that are created by others unless they're either a responder or a viewer of the request.

> [!Note]
> A user will be given a viewer role of a request if they are part of the chat or channel where the approval was created. They won't have the ability to take action on the request if they weren't given that role when the approval was created.
