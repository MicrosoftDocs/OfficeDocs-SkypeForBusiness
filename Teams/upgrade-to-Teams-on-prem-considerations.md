# Upgrade considerations for organizations with Skype for Business Server on-premises &mdash; for IT administrators

This article describes additional considerations for organizations with Skype for Business Server on-premises. This article is the fourth of several that describe upgrade concepts and implementation for IT administrators.  

- [Overview](upgrade-to-teams-on-prem-overview.md)
- [Upgrade methods](upgrade-to-teams-on-prem-upgrade-methods.md)
- [Tools for managing your upgrade](upgrade-to-teams-on-prem-tools.md)
- **Additional considerations for organizations with Skype for Business on-premises** (this article)
- [Implementing your upgrade](upgrade-to-teams-on-prem-implement.md)
- [Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) considerations](upgrade-to-teams-on-prem-pstn-considerations.md)

In addition, the following articles describe important upgrade concepts and coexistence behaviors:

- [Coexistence of Teams and Skype for Business](upgrade-to-teams-on-prem-coexistence.md)
- [Coexistence modes - Reference](migration-interop-guidance-for-teams-with-skype.md)
- [Teams client experience and conformance to coexistence modes](teams-client-experience-and-conformance-to-coexistence-modes.md)



## Considerations for organizations with Skype for Business Server on-premises

- Setting up Skype for Business hybrid is a prerequisite to migrate to TeamsOnly mode. While it is possible to use Teams in Islands mode without hybrid, the transition to TeamsOnly mode cannot be made until the user is moved from Skype for Business on-premises to Skype for Business Online (using [Move-CsUser](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/hybrid/move-users-between-on-premises-and-cloud)). For more information, see [Configure hybrid connectivity](https://docs.microsoft.com/skypeforbusiness/hybrid/configure-hybrid-connectivity).

- If your organization has Skype for Business Server and you have not configured hybrid connectivity, but you still want to use Teams, to administer Teams functionality, you must use an administrative account that has an .onmicrosoft.com domain. 

- Teams users who have a Skype for Business account on-premises (that is, they have not yet been moved to the cloud by using Move-CsUser) cannot interoperate with any Skype for Business users, nor can they federate with external users. This functionality is only available once the users are moved to the cloud (either in Islands mode, or as TeamsOnly users). 

- If you have any users with Skype for Business accounts on-premises, you cannot assign TeamsOnly mode at the tenant level. You must first move all  users with on-premises Skype for Business accounts to the cloud using `Move-CsUser` and then [disable hybrid to complete migration to the cloud](https://docs.microsoft.com/skypeforbusiness/hybrid/cloud-consolidation-disabling-hybrid).  `Grant-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy -PolicyName UpgradeToTeams` will not work at the tenant level if a lyncdiscover DNS record is detected that points to a location other than Office 365.

- You must ensure your users are properly synchronized into Azure AD with the correct Skype for Business attributes. These attributes are all prefixes with “msRTCSIP-”. If users are not synchronized properly to Azure AD, the management tools in Teams will not be able to manage these users. (For example, you won’t be able to assign Teams policies to on-premises users unless you are properly syncing these attributes.) For more information, see [Configure Azure AD Connect for Teams and Skype for Business](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/hybrid/configure-azure-ad-connect).

- To create a new TeamsOnly or Skype for Business Online user in a hybrid organization, *you must first enable the user in Skype for Business Server on-premises*, and then move the user from on-premises to the cloud using Move-CsUser.  Creating the user in on-premises first ensures that any other remaining on-premises Skype for Business users will be able route to the newly created user. Once all users have been moved online, it is no longer necessary to first enable users in on-premises.

- When a user is moved from on-premises to the cloud, meetings organized by that user are migrated to either Skype for Business Online or Teams--depending on whether or not the -MoveToTeams switch is specified.

- If you would like display notifications in the Skype for Business client for on-premises users, you must use TeamsUpgradePolicy in the on-premises toolset. Only the NotifySfbUsers parameter is relevant for on-premises users.  On-premises users receive their mode from the online instances of TeamsUpgradePolicy. See the notes in [Grant-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/grant-csteamsupgradepolicy?view=skype-ps). 

>[!NOTE]
> Any new tenants created after Sept 3, 2019 are created as TeamsOnly tenants unless the organization already has an on-premises deployment of Skype for Business Server. Microsoft uses DNS records to identify on-premises Skype for Business Server organizations. If your organization has on-premises Skype for Business Server with no public DNS entries, you will need to call Microsoft Support to have your new tenant downgraded.
