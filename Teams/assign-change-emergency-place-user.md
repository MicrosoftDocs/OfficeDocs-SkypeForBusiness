# Assign or change the place for an emergency location for a user

Regardless of the [PSTN connectivity option](pstn-connectivity.md) you choose&mdash;Microsoft Calling Plans, Operator Connect, Teams Phone Mobile, or Direct Routing&mdash;an emergency location needs to be assigned to each phone number or user.

Depending on your PSTN connectivity option, however, how you manage and assign emergency locations for a user may vary. For more information, see [Manage emergency calling](what-are-emergency-locations-addresses-and-call-routing.md).

This article describes how to assign or change the *place* for an emergency location for a user in the Microsoft Teams admin center or by using PowerShell.

This article applies to Calling Plans, Operator Connect, and Teams Phone Mobile.

## Using the Microsoft Teams admin center

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, click **Voice** > **Phone numbers**.

2. On the **Phone numbers** page, click the **Numbers** tab, select a user number in the list, and then click **Edit**.

3. On the **Edit** pane, under **Emergency location**, do one of the following:

    - To assign a place, search for the location or place, and then select the place in the search results.

    - To change the place that's already assigned to the user, click **X** to remove the existing location and place, search for and then select the place you want to assign.

4. Depending on whether you want to send an email to the user with their phone number information, turn off or turn on **Email user with telephone number information**. By default, this is on.

5. Click **Apply**.

## Using PowerShell

See [Set-CsOnlineLisLocation](/powershell/module/skype/set-csonlinelislocation).
