# Add, change, or remove an emergency location for your organization

Regardless of the [PSTN connectivity option](pstn-connectivity.md) you choose&mdash;Microsoft Calling Plans, Operator Connect, Teams Phone Mobile, or Direct Routing&mdash;emergency locations can be associated with a phone number.

However, depending on your PSTN connectivity option, how you manage emergency locations and location requirements may vary. For more information, see [Manage emergency calling](what-are-emergency-locations-addresses-and-call-routing.md).

This article describes how to add, change, or remove an emergency location for your organization. 

This article applies to Microsoft Calling Plans, Operator Connect, Teams Phone Mobile, and Direct Routing.

You manage emergency locations for your organization in the Microsoft Teams admin center or by using PowerShell.

To assign an emergency location, users, phone numbers, and emergency locations all need to be in the same country. For more information, see [Assign or change an emergency location for a user](assign-change-emergency-location-user.md).
  
## Add an emergency location

### Using the Microsoft Teams admin center

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, click **Locations** > **Emergency addresses**.
2. Click **Add**.
3. Enter a name and description for the location.
4. Select the country or region, and then enter the address.

   > [!NOTE]
   > In Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, and Spain, it's important to understand that to successfully activate a phone number in Microsoft 365, the address set up in the emergency location, which is used to acquire the number, must match the phone number's area code.

5. If the address isn't found and you want to manually edit the address, turn on **Edit the address manually**.
6. Click **Save**.

### Using PowerShell

See [New-CsOnlineLisCivicAddress](/powershell/module/skype/new-csonlineliscivicaddress).
    
## Change an emergency location

### Using the Microsoft Teams admin center

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, click **Locations** > **Emergency addresses**.
2. In the list, select the location that you want to change, and then click **Edit**.
3. Make the changes you want.
4. Click **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can change the address information for a location only if the address isn't validated. If the address is already validated, and you need to change the address, delete the location, and then create a new location with the correct address.

### Using PowerShell

See [Set-CsOnlineLisCivicAddress](/powershell/module/skype/set-csonlineliscivicaddress).
