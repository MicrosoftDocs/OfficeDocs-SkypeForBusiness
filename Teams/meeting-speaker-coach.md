# Speaker Coach in Microsoft Teams meetings

**APPLIES TO:** ✔️Meetings ✔️Webinars

This setting lets users turn on Speaker Coach during a Teams meeting. Speaker Coach processes the audio of the user while they present, and of all unmuted participants during the meeting and provides private real-time feedback and suggestions for improvement. The user who turned on the Speaker Coach also gets a summary report of the feedback after the meeting. Only the user can view the summary report of feedback. Administrators don't have access to any of this data.

> [!NOTE]
> This setting also affects webinars.

You can only set and edit this policy in PowerShell by using the [Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamsmeetingpolicy) cmdlet. Or, you can create a new Teams meeting policy by using the [New-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/new-csteamsmeetingpolicy) cmdlet and assign it to users.

This setting is enabled by default. To turn it off, set **AllowMeetingCoach** to **False**.
