    The Network Planner tool is available in the Teams admin center. It helps you determine network requirements for your organization. This example scenario shows how you can use the tool to create sites, personas, and running reports for a company called Contoso. 
  
    ## Before you begin

    We assume you already know your way around the Teams admin center, and you are familiar with what you need to do to prepare your network for Teams. If this is the first article you've seen on Network Planner, we recommend that you go through the following articles first.
    
    - [Prepare your organization's network for Teams](prepare-network.md)
    - [Use the Network Planner for Microsoft Teams](network-planner.md) 

    ## Overview of Contoso network

    Contoso has three locations:

    - **Seattle Headquarters:** This is the main location for Contoso. It has 1000 employees and 25 of them are calling only. The site is connected to the internet, and there is a local telephone connection (PSTN). Contoso has Direct Routing set up to be able to use the local telephone connection with Teams. 
    - **Kirkland Office:** This branch office has 400 employees and 10 are calling only. The site uses its connection to the headquarters for both internet and phone (PSTN) traffic. This office is connected to the Seattle headquarters using a WAN connection.
    - **Denver Office:** This office has 250 employees and 50 are calling only. The site has its own local internet connection, but has no direct telephone connection (PSTN).

    Let's get started!

    In the Teams admin center, expand **Org-wide settings** and then select **Network planner**. The first thing you need to do is create a network plan. 

    1. Click **Add a network plan** 
    2. In the **New network plan** pane, add a name and description for your network plan. For this example, we will use *Contoso1* as the plan name, and *Contoso network plan* as the description.
    3. Click **Save**

    After you save your network plan, it will be displayed in the list of your network plans.

- title: Create custom personas
  durationInMinutes: 2

    Next you need to create the necessary personas to represent your users. Since each location has specialized users who will only make phone calls, you need to create that persona.

    1. On the Network planner page, click the **Personas** tab, and then click **+ Custom persona**. 
    2. Add a name and description for this persona, for this example, we'll just call it *Calling only*.
    3. Turn on **Audio** and turn off everything else so that calling is the only permission turned on.
    4. Click **Save** to add the persona to the list.

  durationInMinutes: 5

    Now, you need to add the three sites to your network plan. The table below summarizes the characteristics of Contoso's network locations.

    |Location       |Total number of employees|Calling only employees|Internet connection       |PSTN connection                |WAN link capacity   | Internet link capacity   |
    |---------------|-------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
    |Seattle HQ     |1000                     |25                    |Local Internet            |Local PSTN using Direct Routing| 200 Mbps           | 500 Mbps                 |
    |Kirkland Office|400                      |10                    |Remote Internet through HQ|Remote PSTN through HQ         | 200 Mbps           | N/A                      |
    |Denver Office  |250                      |50                    |Local Internet            |No PSTN connection             | N/A                | 150 Mbps                 |

    1. Click your network plan in Network Planner.
    2. Select the **Network sites** tab and click **Add a network site**.

    ![Adding a network site](media/network-planner-add-network-site.png)

    3. Using the table above, fill in the details for the Seattle HQ site. Turn on both the **ExpressRoute** and **Connected to WAN** toggles. 

    ![New site details](media/network-planner-add-network-site-2.png)

    4. Since the Seattle HQ site has local internet and local PSTN connections, you need to correctly specify these characteristics.

    ![New site egress settings](media/network-planner-add-network-site-link-capacity.png)

    5. Click **Save** to complete adding the Seattle HQ site.
    6. Create the Denver site using the same process. WAN should not be enabled. 
    7. Since the Kirkland site leverages the connection to Seattle HQ for both internet and PSTN connectivity, it is considered a remote site. When creating the Kirkland site, you need to specify that it is connected to WAN and select *Remote* for both **Internet egress** and **PSTN egress**.

- title: Create a report
  durationInMinutes: 3

   Now that you have your sites added, you can create a report. You'll be defining your user distribution while creating the report.

   1. Select the **Report** tab, and then click **Start a report**. This will open the user distribution page. Start by adding a name and a description for your report.

   ![Creating a network planner report](media/network-planner-add-report.png)  

   2. When you first start a report, the user counts for each site will be distributed automatically, for example 80% to office workers, 20% to remote workers. This is where you’ll adjust the number of users for each persona to match your user population. Let's assume that Contoso has the same 80/20 split between office workers and remote workers for each site. Be sure to take the calling only personas out of the number of users in the office. The resulting distribution should look like the image below.

    Once you generate the report, you’ll see a screen displaying your bandwidth requirements both as overall and modality specific values. By default, the allowed bandwidth is set to 30%. By changing this value and clicking **Run report**, you can see the different impact on the bandwidth for your network. Any areas that need more bandwidth will be highlighted in red.

    ![Report analysis](media/network-planner-contoso-report-output.png)

    Network planner also gives you recommendations based on the projected impact of Teams on your network. Click the recommendation view icon to see recommendations for each site, if there are any. The image below shows a sample recommendation view.

    ![Recommendation view](media/network-planner-recommendation-view.png)

    Here, you can see that currently the Kirkland site's bandwidth needs to be increased to get the best performance from Teams.
