# Manage and upload custom meeting backgrounds for Teams meetings

**APPLIES TO:** ✔️Meetings ✔️Webinars ✔️Town halls

[!INCLUDE[Teams Premium](includes/teams-premium-ecm.md)]

## Overview

Custom meeting backgrounds are images that you, as an admin, can upload for your users to display in the background of their video feed during meetings.

Customization in Teams meetings allows organizations to extend their visual identities across the meeting experience. Using custom meeting backgrounds helps foster internal corporate culture building and increase overall brand awareness with both internal and external meeting participants. With the help of your organization's brand management and corporate communications teams, you can easily set up and create custom meeting backgrounds for various business units and departments within a single tenant.

By default, Teams premium licensed users who are either admins or have been assigned a meeting customization policy can create meetings that feature custom meeting  backgrounds. Custom backgrounds are only available for end users within your organization who have a Teams Premium license to use. Your users can still upload their own custom backgrounds.

In town halls, organizers, co-organizers, and presenters in your org can use the custom meeting backgrounds that you've created.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up custom meeting backgrounds for your Teams Meetings, check to make sure you have the following items:

- Access to the Teams Premium SKU.
- You’re an admin with access to the Teams admin center or you’ve been assigned a customization policy.
- You’ve enabled the [custom background policy](#enable-the-custom-background-policy).
- Your background images meet the [required specifications](#add-custom-background-images).

## Set up and manage custom meeting backgrounds in the Teams admin center

You can upload and manage custom meeting backgrounds for Teams meetings in the Teams admin center.

### Enable the custom background policy

To enable the custom background policy, follow these steps:

1. Open the Teams admin center
2. Select **Meetings** from the navigation pane.
3. Under **Meetings**, there are two ways to access the custom background policy:

   - You could select **Customization Policies** to select an existing policy, the global default, or create a new policy.
   - Alternatively, you could select **Meeting Policies** and then select the **Customize meeting visuals** button in the upper right-hand corner.

4. Within your chosen policy, navigate to the **Meeting Backgrounds** section.
5. Toggle the **Use background images from my organization** setting from **Off** to **On** to enable the setting.
6. Select **Save**

### Add custom background images

When you’ve saved the policy, an **+Add** button appears. Once you select **+Add**, a pane called **Managing Backgrounds** opens, allowing you to add your custom background images.  These images are displayed on the end users’ interfaces, ordered by the time of upload.

Uploaded images must adhere to the following parameters. You can upload:

- PNG and JPEG image formats of your images.
- Images with a minimum dimension of 360 px X 360 px.
- Images with a maximum dimension of 3840 px X 2160 px.
- A maximum of 50 custom background images.

> [!NOTE]
> Only end users with a Teams Premium license have these images in their Background Settings panel to use during meetings.

### Save custom background images

You can find previews of your uploaded images in a new table under the **Meeting backgrounds** section. This table also displays the names and resolutions of your images. Once you confirm your choice of uploaded images, select the **Save** button below the preview table. Now that you’ve selected save, your uploaded backgrounds are visible to your users with a Teams Premium license.

## Show only custom backgrounds in your users' gallery

You can decide to only show custom backgrounds you've uploaded in your users' gallery.

To only show custom backgrounds you've uploaded, follow these steps:

1. Select **Meetings** from the navigation pane in the Teams Admin Center
2. Under Meetings, select **Meeting Policies** and select an existing policy, or create a new one.
3. Within your chosen policy, navigate to the **Audio and Video** section and set  **Participants can use video effects** to **Off** or **Only background blur**.
4. Select **Save**
5. Navigate to **Meetings** >  **Customization Policies** to select an existing policy or create a new one.
6. Within your chosen policy, scroll down to the **Meeting backgrounds** section and toggle  **Use background images from my organization** to **On**. If you haven't already, you can upload your custom backgrounds.
