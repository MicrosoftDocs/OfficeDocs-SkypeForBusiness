Use built-in and custom tabs in Microsoft Teams
==================================================

Tabs allow team members to access services on a dedicated canvas within a channel. This lets the team work directly with the tools and data you provide, and to have conversations about them, in the channelâ€™s context. With every new channel, two tabs are provisioned by default, as listed and shown in the image, below:

-   Conversations

-   Files

1.  Owners and team members can add additional tabs, to each channel, to help integrate their cloud services.

2.  Excel, PowerPoint, Word and PDF files must be uploaded to the **Files tab** before they can be converted to tabs. Alternatively, any existing uploaded, files can be converted into tabs with a single click, as shown below.

3.  To add a website, the URL must start with an **https prefix,** so that any information exchanged remains secure.

4.  Detailed instructions are provided when a team member attempts to add a custom tab into their channel.

5.  When a Custom tab is added into a channel, a **Tab conversation** is created that allows team members to have focused discussions about the content.

6.  Additional tabs can be added to channels to help users easily access and manage the data they need or interact with the most. This can be a Power BI report, a dashboard, or even a [Microsoft Stream](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=855785) video channel where you publish training videos.

Develop custom tabs
-------------------

In addition to the built-in tabs, organizations can easily design and develop their own tabs, that can be integrated into Microsoft Teams, or shared with the rest of the community.

The Microsoft Developer Network provides [detailed instructions](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=855786) to design and build your own tabs; and download and deploy [sample tabs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=855787) developed by Microsoft.
