# Manage emergency calling policies in Microsoft Teams

If your organization uses Microsoft Calling Plans, Operator Connect, Teams Phone Mobile, or Direct Routing as your [PSTN connectivity option](pstn-connectivity.md), you can use emergency calling policies in Microsoft Teams to define what happens when a Teams user in your organization makes an emergency call.

The emergency calling policy enables you to:

- Allow end users to configure their emergency address when working at remote locations.

- Configure emergency numbers to determine how emergency calling operates in your organization.

- Configure who to notify when a user calls emergency services. For example, you can configure policy settings to automatically notify your organization's security desk and have them listen to emergency calls.  

You manage emergency calling policies by using the Microsoft Teams admin center or by using Windows PowerShell. You can assign policies to users and [network sites](cloud-voice-network-settings.md).

For users, you can use the global (Org-wide default) policy or create  custom policies. Users automatically get the global policy unless you create and assign a custom policy. You can edit the settings in the global policy, but you can't rename or delete it. For network sites, you create and assign custom policies.

If you assigned an emergency calling policy to a network site and to a user, and if that user is at that network site, the policy that's assigned to the network site overrides the policy that's assigned to the user.

For more information, see [Manage emergency calling](what-are-emergency-locations-addresses-and-call-routing.md) and [Configure security desk notifications](emergency-calling-security-desk-notifications.md).

## Create a custom emergency calling policy

### Use the Teams admin center

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Voice** > **Emergency policies**, and then click the **Calling policies** tab.

2. Click **Add**.

3. Enter a name and description for the policy.

4. To allow your end users to configure their emergency address when they are working from a network location outside the corporate network, set the **External location lookup mode** to on .

5. To show a banner to remind your end users to confirm their emergency location, set theâ€¯**Emergency service disclaimer**. 

6. To customize how emergency calling operates in your organization, configure one or more **Emergency numbers**.  To do this, in the **Emergency numbers** table, select **Add**.  

7. Enter the **Emergency dial string** that people in your organization will dial to contact emergency services. 

8. Set how you want to notify people in your organization, typically the security desk, when an emergency call is made. Under **Notification mode**, select one of the following:

    - **Send notification only**: A Teams chat message is sent to the users and groups that you specify.
    - **Conferenced in but are muted**: A Teams chat message is sent to the users and groups that you specify. They can listen (but not participate) in the conversation between the caller and the PSAP operator.
    - **Conferenced in and are unmuted**: A Teams chat message is sent to the users and groups that you specify. They can unmute to listen and participate in the conversation between the caller and the PSAP operator.

9.  If you select either of the **Conference in muted** notification modes, in the **Numbers to dial for emergency calls notifications** box, you can enter a PSTN phone number of a user or group to call and join the emergency call. For example, enter the number of your organization's security desk, who will receive a call when an emergency call is made and can then listen in on the call. The PSTN phone can't be unmuted even when the mode is set to **Conferenced in muted but are able to unmute**.

10. Select **Apply**.

11. To enter additional **Emergency numbers**, select **Add**. To change or delete an existing configuration, select the row in the table and select **Edit** or **Remove**.  You might want to add additional numbers for testing purposes.  

11. Select **Save**.

### Use PowerShell

See [New-CsTeamsEmergencyCallingPolicy](/powershell/module/teams/new-csteamsemergencycallingpolicy).

## Edit an emergency calling policy

### Use the Microsoft Teams admin center

You can edit the global policy or any custom policies that you create.

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Voice** > **Emergency policies**, and then click the **Calling policies** tab.
2. Select the policy by clicking to the left of the policy name, and then click **Edit**.
3. Make the changes that you want, and then click **Apply**.

### Use PowerShell

See [Set-CsTeamsEmergencyCallingPolicy](/powershell/module/teams/set-csteamsemergencycallingpolicy).

## Assign a custom emergency calling policy to users

[!INCLUDE [assign-policy](includes/assign-policy.md)]

See also [Grant-CsTeamsEmergencyCallingPolicy](/powershell/module/teams/grant-csteamsemergencycallingpolicy).

## Assign a custom emergency calling policy to a network site

### Use the Microsoft Teams admin center

You can assign the global policy or any custom policies that you create.

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Locations** > **Network topology**, and click the **Network sites** tab.
2. Select the site by clicking to the left of the name, and then click **Edit**.
3. Under **Emergency calling policy**, select the policy, and then click **Save**.

### Use PowerShell
Use the [Set-CsTenantNetworkSite](/powershell/module/teams/set-cstenantnetworksite) cmdlet to assign an emergency calling policy to a network site.

The following example shows how to assign a policy called Contoso Emergency Calling Policy 1 to the Site1 site.

```powershell
Set-CsTenantNetworkSite -identity "site1" -EmergencyCallingPolicy "Contoso Emergency Calling Policy 1"
```
