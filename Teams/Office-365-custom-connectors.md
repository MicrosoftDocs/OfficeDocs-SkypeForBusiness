# Manage Microsoft 365 and custom connectors

To keep your team updated, the connectors deliver frequently used content and service updates directly into a Teams channel. With connectors, your Teams users can receive updates from popular services such as Trello, Wunderlist, GitHub, and Azure DevOps Services. The updates are posted directly into the chat stream in their team.

Microsoft 365 connectors are used with both Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 groups, making it easier for all members to stay in sync and receive relevant information quickly. Both Microsoft Teams and Exchange use the same connector model, which allows you to use the same connectors within both platforms. However, if you disable any connectors configured for a Microsoft 365 group, it also disables the ability for the Microsoft 365 group to create connectors.

Any member of a team can connect their team to popular cloud services with the connectors if the team permissions allow, and all team members are notified of activities from that service. Connectors continue to work after the member who initially set up the connector leaves. Any team member with the permissions to add or remove can modify connectors setup by other members.

## Enable or disable connectors in Teams

The Exchange Online PowerShell V2 module uses modern authentication and works with multi-factor authentication, called MFA for connecting to all Exchange related PowerShell environments in Microsoft 365. Admins can use Exchange Online PowerShell to disable connectors for an entire tenant or a specific group mailbox, affecting all users in that tenant or mailbox. It isn't possible to disable for few specific users. Also, connectors are disabled by default for Government Community Cloud, called GCC tenants.

The tenant setting overrides the group setting. For example, if an admin enables connectors for the group and disables them on the tenant, connectors for the group is disabled. To enable a connector in Teams, [connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps#connect-to-exchange-online-powershell-using-modern-authentication-with-or-without-mfa&preserve-view=true) using modern authentication with or without MFA.

To enable or disable a connector, execute the following commands in Exchange Online PowerShell:

* To disable connectors for the tenant: `Set-OrganizationConfig -ConnectorsEnabled:$false`.
* To disable actionable messages for the tenant: `Set-OrganizationConfig -ConnectorsActionableMessagesEnabled:$false`.
* To enable connectors for Teams, execute the following commands:
  * `Set-OrganizationConfig -ConnectorsEnabled:$true`
  * `Set-OrganizationConfig -ConnectorsEnabledForTeams:$true`
  * `Set-OrganizationConfig -ConnectorsActionableMessagesEnabled:$true`

For more information on PowerShell module exchange, see [Set-OrganizationConfig](/powershell/module/exchange/Set-OrganizationConfig?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true). To enable or disable Outlook connectors, [connect apps to your groups in Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/connect-apps-to-your-groups-in-outlook-ed0ce547-038f-4902-b9b3-9e518ae6fbab).

## Publish connectors for your organization

If you want a custom connector to be available only to the users in your organization, you can upload a custom connector app to your organization's app catalog. After you upload the app package, the end-users can install the connector from the organization's app catalog and can configure and use the connector in a team.

<!---TBD: Check if these instructions are for admins or end-users. I cannot find these options either in Teams or in TAC.

To set up a connector:

1. Select **Apps** from the left navigation bar.
1. In the **Apps** section, select **Connectors**.
1. Select the connector that you want to add.
1. From the pop-up menu, select **Add to a team**.
1. In the search box, type a team or channel name.
1. Select **Set up a Connector** from the pop-up menu in the bottom right corner of the dialog window.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Custom connectors are not available in Government Community Cloud (GCC), GCC-High, and Department of Defense (DOD).

To use connectors in a team or a channel, open the More Options menu from the upper right corner of a channel. From the menu select **Connectors** and then locate or search for the required connector app. Configure the selected connector if required.

## Update URL of a connector

The Teams connectors are transitioning to a new URL to enhance security. During transition, you'll receive a notification to update the configured connector. Update your connector at the earliest to prevent any disruption to connector services. To update your connector:

1. In the connectors configuration page, check for **Attention Required** message next to the configured connector.

   :::image type="content" source="media/Teams_Attention_Required_message.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Attention Required message.":::

1. To recreate the connection for incoming webhook connectors, select **Update URL** and use the generated webhook URL.

1. For other connector types, remove the connector and recreate the connector configuration. A **URL is up-to-date** message appears.
