## Want to know how to manage with Windows PowerShell?

- To save time or automate this, you can use the [Get-CsOnlineDialInConferencingLanguagesSupported](/powershell/module/teams/Get-CsOnlineDialInConferencingLanguagesSupported) or [Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingServiceNumber](/powershell/module/teams/Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingServiceNumber) cmdlets.

- Windows PowerShell is all about managing users and what users are allowed or not allowed to do. With Windows PowerShell, you can manage Microsoft 365 or Office 365 by using a single point of administration that can simplify your daily work when you have multiple tasks to do. To get started with Windows PowerShell, see these articles:

  - [Why you need to use Office 365 PowerShell](/microsoft-365/enterprise/why-you-need-to-use-microsoft-365-powershell)

  - [Best ways to manage Microsoft 365 or Office 365 with Windows PowerShell](/previous-versions//dn568025(v=technet.10))

- Windows PowerShell has many advantages in speed, simplicity, and productivity over only using the Microsoft 365 admin center, such as when you're making settings changes for many users at one time. Learn about these advantages in the following articles:

  - [Microsoft Teams PowerShell Overview](teams-powershell-overview.md)
