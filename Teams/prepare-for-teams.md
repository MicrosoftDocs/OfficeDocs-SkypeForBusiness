# Charting your Kaizala to Teams journey

You’ve decided that your organization is ready to move to Teams. Before getting started, it's important that you understand your organization’s collaboration needs before transitioning. What does successful communication look like for your organization? What preparations will your organization need to make for the move? To answer these questions, you'll need to consider what your path to Teams may consist of and the collaboration needs of your workforce.

## Determine your path

Your first action should be to **determine what your path from Kaizala to Teams will look like**. Every organization is unique, and no workforce’s journey will be the exact same. Organizations not currently using Teams will need to make additional strategic decisions to ensure a successful transition journey. Determining your path will help you identify any important actions that should be completed for a successful transition.

We’ve outlined what the path may consist of depending on your organization’s usage today:  

For organizations **not using Teams**:

 1. Envision teamwork for your organization
 
 2. Pilot Teams
  
 3. Deploy Teams
  
 4. Use Kaizala and Teams
  
 5. Manage change
 
 6. Plan for your adoption of Teams
 
 7. Move your organization to Teams

For organizations **already using Teams**:

 1. Plan for your transition
 
 2. Manage change
 
## Identify User Groups

The next action is to **identify user groups for the transition**. *Who will be using the tool and how? What needs will these groups require for effective teamwork?* Understand that every user group has its own unique needs in terms of communication.

We’ve identified three common user groups to support you in identifying collaboration needs.

 1. Information workers

 2. Frontline workers
 
 3. External connections (for example, suppliers/vendors)

Users connecting with other information workers in their workforce need:

 - Chat, meeting, file collaboration
 
 - Work across devices
 
 - Industry solutions
 
 - Advanced IT controls
  
 - Internal and external collaboration with email

Users connecting with the Frontline workforce need:

 - Connection with Frontline Workers within their organization’s directory
 
 - Offline, remote locations
 
 - Workforce engagement and outreach
 
 - Digitized processes and workflows
 
 - Shifts scheduling and tasks management

Users connecting with external users (suppliers/vendors) could use:
 - Guest access collaboration
 
 - Federation
