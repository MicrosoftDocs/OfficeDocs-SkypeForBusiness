    [Microsoft Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/Teams-overview) and [Skype for Business Online](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Video-What-is-Skype-for-Business-3a21eca4-434d-41f1-ab06-3d4a268573b7) 
    are both part of Office 365 that provide chat, phone conversations, voicemail, meetings, files, and apps together in one place. They both require 
    [**Phone System**](/MicrosoftTeams/what-is-phone-system-in-office-365) licenses to enable call control and PBX capabilities in the Office 365 cloud. The license 
    is available as an add-on or as part of the Enterprise E5 licenses. Licensing details are at 
    [Skype for Business add-on licensing](/skypeforbusiness/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing). 

    A Phone System license allows you to replace your existing PBX system with a [set of features](/MicrosoftTeams/here-s-what-you-get-with-phone-system) that include 
    voicemail, Call Queues, and [Auto Attendants](/microsoftteams/what-are-phone-system-auto-attendants), which let people who call your business navigate a menu system to get them 
    to the right department, person, or the Operator. Auto Attendants can be used with either Teams or Skype for Business. You create an Auto Attendant system for your 
    organization using the Skype for Business admin center.
    
    If you are asked to set up an Auto Attendant, this article provides an illustration of planning and implementing Auto Attendants for a hypothetical small business. 
    It's not a one-size-fits-all solution, it's intended as an illustration of the thought process behind creating a functioning structure of several auto attendants. 
  
    ## Before you begin

    We assume you've already done the following: 
    - [Set up Phone System in your organization](/MicrosoftTeams/setting-up-your-phone-system) to provide phone numbers to your users.
    - [Set up Cloud Voicemail](/MicrosoftTeams/set-up-phone-system-voicemail) 
    - Reviewed [What are Cloud Auto Attendants?](/MicrosoftTeams/what-are-phone-system-auto-attendants) to get a 
    better understanding of the Phone System features that can interact with an Auto Attendant.

    Also, you'll be pleased to discover that most of the planning and design portion can be done using a white board or index cards: having a good plan 
    isn't technically demanding.

    VanArsdel, Ltd. is a small town law office with three lawyers and a total of 15 employees, each of whom already has Office 365 and a Phone System 
    voicemail box.    

    The needs assessment might include the following questions:

    ### Q: Who are the people in the business?
    Here's a summary of the employees: 

    |Phone #  |Name	          	|Role	 		 |Notes|
    |:--      |:--              |:--       |:--  |
    |555-0181	|Olga Gerasimova	|lawyer    | |
    |555-0182	|Manuela	Carstens|	lawyer   | |	
    |555-0183	|Andrey	Alexeeva	|lawyer    | |	
    |555-0184	|Lena	Ehrle     	|paralegal | |
    |555-0185	|Svetlana	Uvarova	|paralegal | |
    |555-0186	|Sofia	Krause  	|paralegal | |
    |555-0187	|Mariya	Artemyeva	|paralegal | |
    |555-0188	|Dariya	Polyakova	|paralegal | |
    |555-0189	|Milana	Nikolaeva	|paralegal | |
    |555-0190	|Valeria	Pisani	|office manager |  |
    |555-0191	|Boris	Averyanov	|investigator  |  |
    |555-0192	|Julie	Wolfe	    |reception and scheduling | Also Operator during business hours  |
    |555-0193	|Jakob	Roth	    |billing  |  |
    |555-0194	|Laura	Heinrich	|billing  |  |
    |555-0195	|Franco	Piccio	    |records  |  |
    | | | | |  |
  

    ### Q: Why are the customers calling?
    Your Auto Attendant should address the needs of the customers, and the most frequent customer needs should get addressed first. Since Julie Wolfe is 
    acting as the Operator for the office until the Auto Attendant system is implemented she should be in the best position to tell you what customer 
    needs generate calls. 

    Ask her to keep a record for one week of the calls the business gets, and which users she transfers the calls to in response to customer inquiries. 
    Here’s what she reports back with:

    |Caller issue |	# of calls	| Operator action |
    |:--          |:--          |:--              |
    |Scheduling/rescheduling/cancelling appointments	|45|	No transfer, receptionist handles the call|
    |Billing questions                              	|22|	Transfer to Jakob or Laura in billing | 
    |Inquiry about hours and business location      	|20|	No transfer, receptionist handles the call|
    |Want to speak to one of the lawyers            	|15|	Transfer to the lawyer requested|
    |Want to speak to the office manager            	|12|	Transfer to the office manager |
    |Want to speak to one of the paralegals	            |10|	Transfer to the paralegal requested|
    |Want to speak to the investigator              	| 6|	Transfer to the investigator |
    |Requesting a copy of records	                    | 4|	Transfer to the records clerk |
    | | | |

    ### Q: What special considerations does each job function in the office have?
    Have some discussions with people in each of the job functions in the office about what they need from the Auto Attendant. In our small office the 
    following point was made clear:
    - Billing questions can be handled by either of the clerks. Given that, it’s okay to create a call queue that will send 
    the call to whichever line is not already busy. 

    ### Q: What language requirements do the customers have?
    Asking Julie Wolfe, we discover that there were only two callers in the whole week for whom English seemed to be a second language. They functioned 
    well enough in English to make their inquiries, and they didn’t seem to speak the same native language. Confirming this with the business partners, 
    the lawyers, the need for bilingual or multilingual prompts was not seen as a priority.

    ### Q: What are the business hours, non-business hours and holidays?
    You may want distinct initial greetings for business hours, after-hours, weekends, holidays, and so on.

    ### Q: For each of the job functions in the office, what issues do they handle for customers?
    You may be surprised by what issues the various office workers usually handle. For example, it’s possible that Julie the receptionist can answer many 
    questions you might have assumed should be routed to the billing department or Valeria the office manager.

    ##	General guidelines
    Before we look at our specific example, let’s look briefly at some more general design guidelines and basics.  

    #### Do:
    1.	It's a good idea to have alternate initial greetings for calls taken outside business hours, or on holidays or weekends.
    2.	Put your most frequently used options as early as possible in the first set of menu options. If possible, reserve zero in the first menu for a 
    transfer to a live Operator, and mention it first in the scripts. 
    3.	Have the menu repeat at least once if nothing is selected, and if there still isn't a selection, transfer the call to a live Operator rather than having 
    the call disconnect. By default, Phone System will replay the menu three times, then if an Operator is configured the call will transfer to the Operator or 
    if no Operator is configured the system will hang up. Given that, it's important to configure an Operator for your Auto Attendant system.
    4.	Use multilingual prompts, but put the secondary language or languages at the end of the first set of options. You’ll need to create a separate 
    set of nested Attendants for the secondary language.
    5.	Take a few extra minutes to flow chart the options you want to create, and make sure you aren't creating opportunities for users to go around in 
    circles in the option menus. It should ideally be possible to get connected to a person or their voicemail in three menus or less.
    
    #### Don't:
    1.	Create a nested Auto Attendant with more than 5 choices. If you do, you'll likely confuse your callers and force them to repeat the menu.
    2.	Use reserved menu option numbers or keys as menu options.

    > [!Important]
    > The keys \* (Repeat) and \# (Back) are reserved by the system and can't be reassigned. If speech recognition is enabled, pressing \* will correspond with 
    "Repeat" and \# will correspond with the "Back" voice commands.
  

    ## Do a design mockup 

    To do the initial design, you'll need a flexible and easy way to work out hierarchies and structures of users and Auto Attendants. Here’s an exercise you 
    can do on any blank wall or whiteboard, using several colors of pen and some sticky notes or index cards and tape:
    1.	For each person with a voicemail account in the business, write their name and phone number on a sticky note or 3x 5 index card. You may need 
    several notes for the employee who will be the Operator. If you have several colors of note available, it might help to distinguish users and Auto Attendants at a glance.
    2.	Mark one note as the Main Auto Attendant, which will include a business hours initial greeting, an after hours greeting, and a main menu. 
    You'll probably also want  an Auto Attendant to represent the hours and location recording (if you’re choosing to use one), 
    and additional Auto Attendants as needed to cover the needs of your callers. If possible, use a different color of note to represent Auto Attendants.
    3.	Place the main Auto Attendant note on your board space, if any of the top options go directly to a single employee put their note to the right of the note representing the attendant. 
    4.	It’s unlikely all the options will fit on a the Main Auto Attendant menu, so think about which additional attendants might be needed and how they might nest under the main attendant.  
    5.	If you have an option that leads to a call queue, create a note using a third color, place it below and to the right of the Attendant that connects to the Call Queue.
    Place notes representing the users in the queue to the right of the note representing the queue, or over the top of it (whichever is clearer to you).

    Here’s a diagram representing one way to implement our example:

    ![Diagram of Auto Attendants at a lawyer's office](media/AA-LawyerOfficeExample.png)

    The example in the diagram takes into account the reasons the office's customers call, and the do and don't recommendations. Even in a small 
    office, the complexity of an Auto Attendant can grow quickly.   You might notice the following things about the design chosen here:
    
    - The most common reason for calling was to schedule appointments, so it was listed first. The other reasons to call are given as options in 
    descending order of their use.
    - There are usually 3-4 options per menu in this example. While Phone System supports menus with up to 9 options, most users 
    won't be able to keep track of more than 5 options without getting confused and needing to repeat the menu, which wastes their time and annoys them. 
    - The lawyer, paralegals, and billing menus can arguably be replaced with Call Queues. The main reason we've used an Auto Attendant is to keep our 
    implementation focused on Auto Attendants. Actual implementations would probably use Call Queues.  See [Create a Cloud call queue](/MicrosoftTeams/create-a-phone-system-call-queue)
    for more about Call Queues. 
    - Eventually, every employee gets matched with an Auto Attendant option in this design. This might not be what you choose to do, you may want a 
    much simpler system with fewer options. If that simplicity is important, you can plan to enable the **Dial by Name** option and remove one or more 
    of the nested Auto Attendants that mention specific employees by name.
    - The example assumes that after hours, callers will get a message letting them know the business is closed, then only leaves them the option to leave a message to the operator. 
    You could decide instead to send after-hours calls to the normal menu tree, if you'd prefer. 

    This slightly simpler example shows the use of Call Queues and slightly longer menus, therefore needing fewer Auto Attendants:

    ![Another diagram of Auto Attendants at a lawyer's office](media/AA-LawyerOffice-CallQueues.png)

    In this example, we can assume we've enabled the **Dial by Name** option and it's expected that callers either know the name of the person or they're okay with 
    talking to anyone in that job category. Since this is an optional variation, the later stages will assume we're implementing the first diagram. 

    If you have Visio, you could use that to visualize your design. The Visio file containing the diagrams above is available for 
    [download](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/OfficeDocs-SkypeForBusiness/blob/live/Skype/SfbOnline/images/AA-LawyerOfficeExample.vsdx?raw=true). 

- title: Writing the scripts 
  durationInMinutes: 3
  content: |
    ### Writing better Auto Attendant scripts 
    Your auto-attendant script can make or break the impression left on your customers or callers. 
    Plan it carefully, write it out, and consider having it professionally recorded. The goal is to connect the caller to a live person as efficiently as possible.
    Think about some of these guidelines when writing the script dialog:

    #### Do:
    1.	Greet and thank the caller for contacting you. Keep this short, no more than three sentences and under 30 seconds. If your web site offers self-service 
    options, mention it but otherwise present choices and options as soon as possible without being abrupt. 
    2.	Use multilingual prompts, but put the secondary language or languages at the end of the first set of options.
    3.	Present the option, then the number to press ("For Sales, press 3"). When the caller hears the option they want, their attention immediately focuses, so 
    that's the time to tell them what will get them there.
    4.	Make sure the voice for the prompts leaves the impression you want and is clearly understandable.  Phone System has a built in text to speech 
    engine which gives you the option of entering your final text and deciding for yourself whether it's conveying the impression you want. If not, 
    recording an audio prompt is fully supported. If the voice mumbles, sounds condescending, or has other issues, keep looking.
    5.	Mention significant changes to your option structure when that happens, but don't leave that part of the greeting active for more than a month. If you 
    have frequent updates and expect that to be the case most of the time, just omit it from the script.
    
    #### Don't:
    1.	Clutter the initial greeting with hours of operation or your business address. Make those available as a choice in the first menu if it's frequently 
    requested information, but keep the initial greeting short and sweet.
    2.	Say please or use other pleasantries over and over. Just get the callers to the option or person they need as efficiently as possible.
    3.	Include "http:\/\/www\." when mentioning a web address. It's just a poor use of script time.
    4.	Use abbreviations like St for street or CA for California. Spell them out in the script and say the whole word in the recording. 
    Text to speech engines don't usually do well with abbreviations.
    5.	Include sales information in the scripts, you'll annoy your callers. Let your sales force take care of that sort of thing.

    And finally, if your company has a slogan, think twice about including it in the script at all. Chances are your callers have heard it before if they're calling 
    you. If you do include it, put it somewhere it brings the Auto Attendant experience to a close, like when transferring to an individual's desk line or voicemail. 
    If you’ve had a slogan or tag line for a long time that many of your customers know, it might or might not be worth including. The "golden rule" here is to connect the caller to a person as efficiently as possible.

    ### Sample Auto Attendant scripts

    > [!Important]
    > The keys \* (Repeat) and \# (Back) are reserved by the system and can't be reassigned. If speech recognition is enabled, pressing \* will correspond with 
    "Repeat" and \# will correspond with the "Back" voice commands.

    These scripts reflect the design we chose earlier, and the suggested guidelines for writing Auto Attendant scripts. 

    #### Script 1: company greeting
    Thanks for calling VanArsdel, Ltd. At any time you can press zero to transfer to the Operator, press star to repeat the menu, or press pound to return to the previous menu.
    
    (Optional, if Dial by Name will be enabled) If you know the name of the person you're calling, say their name at any time and you'll be transferred to them.

    #### Script 2: after-hours greeting
    Thanks for calling VanArsdel, Ltd.  We’re closed at this time, press zero and leave a message with our Operator. We’ll call you back when we return to the office. 

    #### Script 3: main menu
    For scheduling, press 1.
    For billing questions, press 2.
    For hours and location, press 3.
    For more options, press 4.

    *Available options not mentioned: zero, \*, and \#.*

    #### Script 4: billing
    To speak to Jakob Roth, press 1.
    To speak to Laura Heinrich, press 2.

    *Available options not mentioned: zero, \*, and \#.*

     This script could be omitted if you redesigned using Call Queues.

    #### Script 5: hours and Location
    We are open for business from 8:30am to 5:30 pm, Tuesday through Saturday. Our address is 1234 Green Street near Central avenue, Planktown Pennsylvania, 
    directly across from City Hall.

    Available options not mentioned: zero, *, and #.

    #### Script 6: more menu options
    To speak to one of the lawyers, press 1.
    To speak to the office manager, press 2. 
    To speak to one of the paralegals, press 3.
    For other options, press 4.

    *Available options not mentioned: zero, \*, and \#.*

    #### Script 7: lawyer menu
    To speak to Olga Gerasimova, press 1.
    To speak to for Manuela Carstens, press 2.
    To speak to for Andrey Alexeeva, press 3.

    *Available options not mentioned: zero, \*, and \#.* 

    This script could be omitted if you redesigned using Call Queues.

    ####	Script 8: paralegal menu
    To speak to Lena Ehrle, press 1.
    To speak to Svetlana Uvarova, press 2.
    To speak to Sofia Krause, press 3. 
    To speak to Mariya Artemyeva, press 4.
    To speak to Dariya Polyakova, press 5.
    To speak to Milana Nikolaeva, press 6.

    *Available options not mentioned: zero, \*, and \#.*

     This script could be omitted if you redesigned using Call Queues.

    ####	Script 9: additional menu options
    To speak to our investigator, press 1.
    To request a copy of your records, press 2.

    *Available options not mentioned: zero, \*, and \#.*



- title: Implementing Auto Attendants
  durationInMinutes: 7
  content: |

    The information needed to implement the design in the earlier diagram is presented in the tables that follow.
    The implementation uses text-to-speech for the scripts. Phone System has a built in text to speech engine so you the option 
    of entering your final text and deciding for yourself whether it conveys the impression you want. If not, it's up to you whether to record your 
    own prompts using recording software or have a professional voice-over artist use your scripts to record .wav files.
    
    As mentioned earlier, your implementation could easily involve Call Queues, which could be used in place of the lawyer, paralegal, and billing 
    Auto Attendants below. A Call Queue would transfer the call to any of the available lawyers, paralegals, or billing clerks. See [Create a Cloud call queue](/MicrosoftTeams/create-a-phone-system-call-queue)
    for more about Call Queues. If you choose to do this, you'll need to create a valid Call Queue before creating an Auto Attendant menu that refers to the Call Queue.

    Your account must have Admin privileges. In the **Microsoft Teams admin center**, click **Voice** then select **Auto Attendants**, then click **+ New**. 
    The following tables show values to enter in the user interface screens. Each table represents a user interface screen.
    
    Create the following Auto Attendants in the following order and set their general information, then once the main and nested Auto Attendants are all created, edit them to set the 
    Business hours call handling. A nested Auto Attendant needs to already exist when you link to it in another Auto Attendant's menu choices. 


    ### Main Auto Attendant

    ![Screen shot of My Auto Attendant screen with callouts](media/edacec94-9384-4a87-be0a-5c49a151287e.png)

    **Edit general info** for the main menu

    |   Option   | Setting      |
    |:---  |:---   |
    | ![Number 1 label, relative to the callout in the previous screen shot](media/sfbcallout1.png) AA Name  |   VanArsdel, Ltd.   | 	
    | ![Number 2 label, relative to the callout in the previous screen shot](media/sfbcallout2.png) Resource account	|   |
    | ![Number 3 label, relative to the callout in the previous screen shot](media/sfbcallout3.png) Time Zone	| (UTC-04:00) Eastern Daylight Time (US & Canada) |
    | ![Number 4 label, relative to the callout in the previous screen shot](media/sfbcallout4.png) Language	| English (United States)  |
    | ![Number 5 label, relative to the callout in the previous screen shot](media/sfbcallout5.png) Voice inputs	| Enabled |
    | ![Number 6 label, relative to the callout in the previous screen shot](media/sfbcallout6.png) Operator	| Person in your company: Julie Wolfe |
    |  |  | 
     
    Only the main menu, named *VanArsdel, Ltd.* needs a resource account with an assigned Phone Number.  
    
    Enabling **Voice inputs**  will enable voice commands for a given menu. 
    It will also enable callers to say "Operator" and get transferred directly to the Operator.

    ![Screen shot of Business hours screen with callouts](media/61769547-cdb4-45c0-af5a-3d6e0731fbc6.png)

    **Select hours of operation** for the main menu

    | Option   | Setting |
    |:--- | :--- |
    | ![Number 1 label, relative to the callout in the previous screen shot](media/sfbcallout1.png) 24/7-Custom| Custom  |
    | ![Number 2 label, relative to the callout in the previous screen shot](media/sfbcallout2.png) Selection|  8:30am to 5:30pm, Monday-Friday  |
    
    The default for this screen is 24/7. 
       
    ![Screen shot of Business hours screen with callouts](media/61769547-cdb4-45c0-af5a-3d6e0731fbc6.png)

    **Business hours call handling** for the main menu

    |   Option   | Setting      |
    |:---  |:---  |
    | ![Number 1 label, relative to the callout in the previous screen shot](media/sfbcallout1.png) Company greeting	| Create a custom greeting > Callers will hear: Copy/paste Script 1 above  |
    | ![Number 3 label, relative to the callout in the previous screen shot](media/sfbcallout3.png) What happens to the calls after the greeting?	| Play menu options prompt, menu prompt: Create a custom prompt <br/>Callers will hear: Script 3 above |
    | ![Number 4 label, relative to the callout in the previous screen shot](media/sfbcallout4.png) Dial By Name  | Enabled   |
    | ![Number 5 label, relative to the callout in the previous screen shot](media/sfbcallout5.png) Edit Menu options	|**1:** Enter the Name of the option: Scheduling <br/>Send to: Person in your company: **Julie Wolfe** <br/>**2:** Enter the Name of the option: Billing <br/>Send to: nested Auto Attendant **Billing** <br/>**3:** Enter the name of the option: Hours <br/>Send to: nested Auto Attendant **Hours&Location** |
    |  |   |
    
    The Company Greeting usually only needs to be set on the main menu, with a nested Auto Attendant we want to flow straight through to the Custom Prompt.


    **After hours call handling** for the main menu
    The After Hours call handling screen is very similar to the Business hours Call handling screen.
    
    |   Option   | Setting|
    |:---  | :---  |
    | ![Number 1 label, relative to the callout in the previous screen shot](media/sfbcallout1.png) Company greeting	| Create a custom greeting, callers will hear: Copy/paste Script 2 above |
    | ![Number 3 label, relative to the callout in the previous screen shot](media/sfbcallout3.png) What happens to the calls after the greeting?|	Redirect call- Send to: Person in your company: **Julie Wolfe**. <br/> The call will go to voicemail when not picked up.  |
    |  |   |

    While setting up your after hours call handling for the Main Auto Attendant, you could choose to create the same menu options used in the business hours call handling screen. Doing this would allow the after 
    hours callers to navigate the same menus as business hours callers. It's a matter of preference which approach you choose.

    Set up **holidays** and the **dial scope** as you see fit, and save the Main Auto Attendant.

    ### Nested Auto Attendants

    Nested Auto Attendants don't usually have phone numbers associated or a company greeting, and they only get accessed as directed in the main Auto Attendant.

    Set up the General Information for the nested Auto Attendants using different names but the same Time Zone, Language, Speech Recognition and Operator settings. 
    
    Set the business hours call handling as shown for each Auto Attendant. You can leave the business hours for a nested Auto Attendant set to the default, 24/7.
    
    You can also choose to leave the holidays and dial scope settings at their defaults for nested Auto Attendants.
    
    
    **Nested Auto Attendant: Billing (nested under main menu)**

    Business hours call handling settings for this Auto Attendant:
    
    |   Option   | Setting|

    ### Editing and testing Auto Attendants

    After you have saved your Auto Attendant, it will be listed on the **Auto Attendants** page of the Admin center. 
    This will allow you to quickly see some of the options that you have set up.
    
    The best way to test the implementation is to call the number configured for an Auto Attendant and choose options to navigate to each of the auto 
    attendants you've just created. You can also quickly place a test call to your Auto Attendant by using the **Test button** in the Action pane. 
    If you want to make changes to an Auto Attendant, select the Auto Attendant, and then in the Action pane click **Edit**.
