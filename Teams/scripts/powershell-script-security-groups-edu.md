# PowerShell script sample - Create security groups for educators and students in your school

Use this PowerShell script to create the security groups that you need to manage Microsoft Teams policies in your school. The [policy assignment to groups](../assign-policies-users-and-groups.md#assign-a-policy-to-a-group) feature in Teams lets you assign a policy to a group of users, such as a security group. The policy assignment is propagated to members of the group according to precedence rules. As members are added to or removed from a group, their inherited policy assignments are updated accordingly.

This PowerShell script creates two security groups, one for staff and educators and another for students in your school, based on license type. You can then assign policies to the security groups that you created. For more information about using this script, see [Assign policies to large sets of users in your school](../batch-group-policy-assignment-edu.md).

This script does the following:

- Identifies staff and educators who are assigned a Faculty SKU, creates a security group, and then adds staff and educators  to the group.
- Identifies students who are assigned a Student SKU, creates a security group, and then adds the students to the group.
- Updates the membership of each security group to add or remove staff, educators, and students based on whether they have a license.

You'll need to run this script regularly to keep the security groups fresh and up to date.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's important to understand [precedence rules](../assign-policies-users-and-groups.md#precedence-rules) and [group assignment ranking](../assign-policies-users-and-groups.md#group-assignment-ranking) when assigning policies to groups. Make sure that you read and understand the concepts in [What you need to know about policy assignment to groups](../assign-policies-users-and-groups.md#what-you-need-to-know-about-policy-assignment-to-groups).

## Before you start

Download and install the [Skype for Business Online PowerShell module](/microsoft-365/enterprise/manage-skype-for-business-online-with-microsoft-365-powershell), and then restart your computer if prompted.

To lean more, see [Manage Skype for Business Online with Office 365 PowerShell](/office365/enterprise/powershell/manage-skype-for-business-online-with-office-365-powershell) and [Teams PowerShell overview](../teams-powershell-overview.md).


## Sample script

```powershell
<#
Script Name:
CreateOrUpdate_SecurityGroup_Per_LicenseType.ps1
Synopsis:
This script is designed to perform following operations:
1. Create a security group for faculty and student members based on the assigned license SKU and add the members accordingly.
2. Update the security group to add/remove teachers and students so that only users who have a valid teacher/student license are present in the group.
The output of the script is written in a log file present at location: C:\results\log.txt
