# Information barriers in Microsoft Teams preview

> [!INCLUDE [Preview feature](includes/preview-feature.md)]

Information barriers are policies that an admin can configure to prevent individuals or groups from communicating with each other. This is useful if, for example, one department is handling information that shouldn’t be shared with other departments or a group needs to be prevented from communicating with any outside contacts.

> [!NOTE]
> - Information barrier groups cannot be created across tenants.
> - Using bots to add users is not supported for version 1.

Information barrier policies also prevent lookups and discovery. This means that if you attempt to communicate with someone you should not be communicating with, you will not find that user in the people picker.

## Background

The primary driver for Information Barriers comes from the financial services industry. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ([FINRA]( http://www.finra.org/)) reviews information barriers and conflicts of interest within member firms and provides guidance as to how to manage such conflicts (FINRA 2241, [Debt Research Regulatory Notice 15-31](http://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/Regulatory-Notice-15-31_0.pdf).  

## When should I use information barriers?

You might want to use information barriers in situations like these:

- A team must be prevented from communicating or sharing data with a specific other team.
- A team must not communicate or share data with anyone outside of the team.

The Information Barrier Policy Evaluation Service determines whether a communication complies with information barrier policies. 

## Managing information barrier policies

Information barrier policies are managed with Security & Compliance Center (SCC) PowerShell cmdlets. For more information about using these cmdlets, [sign up here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR1UzUQTEgHVPtD9W5uih2OlUMEwwUzhJSktIMUw2SDJJOE5FT1lTVzVTSS4u).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you set up or define policies, **you must enable scoped directory search in Microsoft Teams**. Wait at least 24 hours after enabling scoped directory search before you set up or define policies for information barriers.

## Information barriers administrator role

The information barriers administrator role is responsible for managing information barrier policies. For more information about this role and to participate in the preview, [sign up here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR1UzUQTEgHVPtD9W5uih2OlUMEwwUzhJSktIMUw2SDJJOE5FT1lTVzVTSS4u).

## When are information barrier policies checked?

Information barrier policies are checked when the following Teams events take place:

- **Members are added to a team** - Whenever you add a user to a team, the user’s policy must be evaluated against the information barrier policies of other team members. After the user is successfully added, the user can perform all functions in the team without further checks. If the user's policy blocks them from being added to the team, the user will not show up in search.
- **A new chat is requested** - Each time a new chat is requested between two or more users, the chat is evaluated to make sure that it isn’t violating any Information barrier policies. If the conversation violates an information barrier policy, then the conversation isn’t initiated, and an error message appears.
- **A user is invited to join a meeting** - When a user is invited to join a meeting, the user's policy is evaluated against the policies of other team members, and if there’s a violation, the user will not be allowed to join the meeting and will see an error message.
- **A screen is shared between two or more users** - Any time a screen is shared between two or more users, the screen share must be evaluated to make sure that it doesn’t violate the information barrier policies of other users. If an information barrier policy is violated, the screen share won’t be allowed, and an error message will appear.
- **A user places a phone call (VOIP) in Teams** - Any time a voice call is initiated by a user to another user or group of users, the call is evaluated to make sure that it doesn’t violate the information barrier policies of oher team members. If there is any violation, the voice call is blocked.

## What happens to existing chat threads when a policy is changed?

When the information  barrier policy admin makes changes to the policy or a policy change kicks into effect because of a user’s job changing or a similar reason, the Information Barrier Policy Evaluation Service automatically searches the members to ensure that members of the Team are not violating any policies. 

If there is an existing chat or other communication between users, and a new policy is set or an existing policy is changed, the service evaluates existing communications to make sure that they aren’t “poisoned” (no longer allowed): 

- **1:1 chat** - If communication between the two users is no longer allowed (if a policy blocking communication is applied to one or both users), further communication is blocked and the chat conversation will become read-only.
- **Group chat** - If communication from one user to the group is no longer allowed (for example, if a user changes jobs), the user along with the other users who violate the policy may be removed from group chat and further communication with the group will not be allowed. The user can still see old conversations (which will be read-only), but will not be able to see or participate in any new conversations with the group. If the new or changed policy preventing communication is applied to more than one user, the users who are affected by the policy may be removed from group chat. They can still see old conversations. 
- **Team** - Any users who have been removed from the group are removed from the team and will not be able to see or participate in existing or new conversations.
