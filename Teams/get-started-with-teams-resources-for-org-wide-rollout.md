# Get resources to plan your organization-wide rollout of Microsoft Teams

Now that you've successfully set up your first teams, onboarded an initial group of users while driving usage, it's time to look at your go-forward plan to deploy Teams across the rest of your organization while driving adoption.

## Deploy Teams
The [Deploy Teams](deployment-overview.md) section of our documentation provides IT pros with the guidance to make the best decisions for an organization-wide rollout.

## Adopt Teams
The [Adopt Teams](adopt-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md) section of our documentation steps you through how to successfully adopt Teams in your organization.
