# Calling plans in Office 365 - Complaint handling code for the United Kingdom (U.K.)

This Code applies to small business customers (organizations with 10 employees or less) in the United Kingdom (UK) with respect to the Office 365 Calling Plan service (the "Service") in accordance with UK communications regulations. Other Skype for Business services are governed by your service agreement with Microsoft and any other terms applicable to your use of the particular service.

## How to make a complaint

Customer satisfaction is a priority for Skype for Business. However, in the event that you are dissatisfied with the Service for any reason, you may file a complaint by phone or online:

- Toll-Free Phone Number: 0800 032 6417

- Online: Sign in to the Office 365 admin center and submit a service request by selecting **New service request** under **Support**.

## Timelines

If you file a complaint by phone during normal business hours, you will speak to a live Skype for Business representative, who will attempt to resolve the issue during the phone call.

If you file a complaint online, a Skype for Business representative will respond to your complaint within two (2) business days of receiving the complaint and will attempt to resolve the issue immediately.

If a Skype for Business representative is unable to resolve the issue immediately, he or she will clearly explain further steps that need to be taken to investigate the matter. The representative will provide you his or her contact information so that you may contact him or her with any questions throughout the course of the investigation.

Skype for Business aims to resolve all complaints related to the Service within seven (7) business days of receipt.

If you are unhappy with the manner in which your complaint regarding the Service is managed, you may ask the Skype for Business representative handling your complaint, by phone or email, to escalate the complaint to in accordance with your service agreement. Microsoft will evaluate the complaint within seven (7) days of receipt.

## Alternative dispute resolution

If your complaint regarding the Service is not resolved after eight (8) weeks of submission or if you receive a letter from us stating that we have reached a final decision, you may refer the complaint to Ombudsman Services, which is a third party approved by Ofcom to deal with complaints regarding communications services. We will also notify you, in writing, about the availability of such alternative dispute resolutions services.

Ombudsman Services is independent of Microsoft and will render an impartial decision on the merits of the complaint. There is no cost for referring a complaint to Ombudsman Services.

All complaints must be sent to Ombudsman Services within twelve (12) months of filing the complaint with Skype for Business.

The steps for referring a complaint to Ombudsman Services can be found on the Ombudsman Services' [website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=820708&amp;clcid=0x809).
