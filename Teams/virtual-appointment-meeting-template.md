# Virtual appointment meeting template in Microsoft Teams

**APPLIES TO:** ✔️Meetings ✖️Webinars ✖️Town halls

![Information icon](media/info.png) **Some features described in this article require [Teams Premium](teams-add-on-licensing/licensing-enhance-teams.md)**.

## Overview

The Virtual appointment template is a default meeting template in Microsoft Teams that your users can use to schedule virtual appointments with customers, clients, and other people outside your organization. For example, use it to schedule and conduct interviews, mentorship sessions, financial consultations, virtual shopping experiences, and more.

This article gives you an overview of how to view and manage the Virtual appointment meeting template in the Teams admin center.

## Manage the Virtual appointment meeting template

You use meeting template policies in the Teams admin center to control which meeting templates are available to users in your organization. By default, the Global policy allows users to see and use all meeting templates, including the Virtual appointment template and any custom templates that you created.

If you want to make the Virtual appointment template available to specific users or groups of users in your organization, you can create a custom meeting template policy, and then assign it to those users or groups.

To learn more, see [Manage meeting templates in Teams](manage-meeting-templates.md).

## User experience

When users in your organization use the meeting template to schedule a virtual appointment, people outside your organization (external guests) get a tailored meeting invitation that includes a **Join appointment as a guest** button and other appointment details. They can use this button to easily join from any device without having to download and install Teams.

Keep in mind that some Teams meeting options may not apply to external guests or to any person who joins using the **Join appointment as a guest** button. The following meeting options are supported for guests to join:

- **Who can bypass the lobby**: The **Everyone** setting allows external guests to bypass the lobby.
- **Choose co-organizers**
- **Record automatically**
- **Allow meeting chat**: Set to **Disabled** if you want to prevent a meeting chat before, during, and after the meeting.

People within your organization receive a meeting invitation, and the appointment appears in their Teams and Outlook calendar, from where they can easily join as in any other Teams meeting. All Teams meeting options apply to attendees who join using the Teams meeting link in the meeting invitation or from the Teams or Outlook calendar.

> [!NOTE]
>The external guests need pop-up notifications allowed on their mobile and web browser for the browser-based Teams experience to function properly. This setting will show a pop-up asking for permission to access the microphone and camera for the meeting, which is required for the meeting to begin.
