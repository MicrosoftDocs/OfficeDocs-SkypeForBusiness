# Manage live streaming for Teams meetings and webinars

**APPLIES TO:** ✔️Meetings ✔️Webinars ✖️Town halls

Live streaming allows organizers in your org to expand their reach and provide a unique experience for meeting and webinar attendees. As an admin, when you enable live streaming, your organizers can stream meetings and webinars to external endpoints by providing a Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) URL and key to the built-in Custom Streaming app in Teams.

To learn more about how your organizers can use RTMP to live stream meetings and webinars, see [Broadcast audio and video from Teams with RTMP](https://support.microsoft.com/office/broadcast-audio-and-video-from-teams-with-rtmp-11d5707b-88bf-411c-aff1-f8d85cab58a0).

> [!NOTE]
> Organizers can't stream live events.

## Manage live streaming for your users

You can use the Teams admin center or PowerShell to manage whether organizers with this assigned policy can live stream their meetings and webinars through RTMP.

### Manage live streaming in the Teams admin center

Follow these steps to manage live streaming in the Teams admin center:

1. In the Teams admin center, expand **Meetings** and then select **Meeting policies**.
1. Select the policy that you want to edit.
1. Under **Audio & video**, set **Live streaming** to **On**.
1. Select **Save**

### Manage live streaming with PowerShell

To manage whether organizers with this policy can live stream their meetings and webinars through RTMP, use the **`-LiveStreamingMode`** parameter within the PowerShell [**CsTeamsMeetingPolicy**](/powershell/module/teams/set-csteamsmeetingpolicy) cmdlet.

To allow organizers with this policy to stream their meetings through RTMP, use the following script:

```PowerShell
Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity Global -LiveStreamingMode Enabled
```

For information on how to assign policies with PowerShell, see [Assign policies in Teams](policy-assignment-overview.md).
