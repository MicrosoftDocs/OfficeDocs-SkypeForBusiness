# Microsoft Teams feedback privacy

At Microsoft we take feedback from our customers very seriously. The feedback you provide will be used to troubleshoot, fix bugs, enhance existing features, and develop new ones. Your feedback may be reviewed by teams responsible for product quality and customer assurance.

You can request copies of your feedback or ask for the feedback you provided to be deleted. For more info, see the [Export or delete your Teams data](https://support.microsoft.com/office/export-or-delete-your-teams-data-1ed6ac68-5fb4-41be-9861-1a4127fecf68) article.

When submitting feedback, we ask that you not include sensitive information, like phone numbers, addresses, or highly personal stories. Instead, please provide information on the specific issue you are experiencing with our app or your experience with the app. This will help us maintain your privacy as we review and take action based on your feedback.

As always, thank-you for taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Your perspectives help us improve our existing products and develop better ones.
