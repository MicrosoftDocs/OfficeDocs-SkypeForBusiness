# Step 1 - Get familiar with Teams meeting features

Teams has several meeting features that can help make them more inclusive and dynamic. Rather than having a single presenter present information to an audience or a group in a room have discussions while remote participants observe, these features can give all participants an equal voice. Where possible, links are included to more detailed information about each feature.
