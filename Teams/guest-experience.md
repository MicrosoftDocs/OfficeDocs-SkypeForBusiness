What the guest experience is like
=================================

When a guest is invited to join a team, they receive a welcome email message that includes some information about the team and what to expect now that they're a member. The guest must redeem the invitation in the email message before they can access the team and its channels.
    
![Screen shot showing an example of a welcome email message](media/guest-experience-image1.png)
    
All team members see a message in the channel thread announcing that the team owner has added a guest and providing the guest's name. Everyone on the team can identify easily who is a guest. As shown in the following screenshot of a sample team, a banner indicates "This team has guests" and a "(Guest)" label appears next to each guest's name.
