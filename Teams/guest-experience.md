What the guest experience is like
=================================

When a guest is invited to join a team, they receive a welcome email message that includes some information about the team and what to expect now that they're a member. The guest must redeem the invitation in the email message before they can access the team and its channels.

The message includes text that can be customized by the team owner and brief descriptions of Teams features like chat, calls, and meetings.](media/bc0deb82-6394-4280-8fed-312645c8fefe.png)
  
    
    
All team members see a message in the channel thread announcing that the team owner has added a guest and providing the guest's name. Everyone on the team can identify easily who is a guest. As shown in the following screenshot of a sample team, a banner indicates "This team has guests" and a "GUEST" label appears next to each guest's name.

The following table compares the Microsoft Teams functionality available for an organization's team members to the functionality available for a guest user on the team.
