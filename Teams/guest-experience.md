# Guest experience in Teams

When a guest is invited to join a team, they receive a welcome email message. This message includes some information about the team and what to expect now that they're a member. The guest must accept the invitation before they can access the team and its channels. They can do this in the Teams client or by selecting **Open Microsoft Teams** in the email message.

> [!NOTE]
> After a guest is added to a team, it may take a few hours before they have access.

All team members see a message in the channel thread announcing that the team owner has added a guest and providing the guest's name. Everyone on the team can identify easily who is a guest. A tag in the upper-right corner of the channel thread indicates the number of guests on the team and a **(Guest)** label appears next to each guest's name.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Guest user access restrictions** policy in Microsoft Entra ID determines permissions for guests in your directory. There are three policy options.
>  - The **Guest users have the same access as members (most inclusive)** setting means guests have the same access to directory data as regular users in your directory.
>  - The **Guest users have limited access to properties and membership of directory objects** settings means that guests don't have permissions for certain directory tasks, such as enumerating users, groups, or other directory resources using Microsoft Graph.
>  - The **Guest user access is restricted to properties and memberships of their own directory objects (most restrictive)** setting means guests can only access their own directory objects.
>
