View guest users in a team
==========================
Anyone in a team can see all members of a team, including guests, via **Manage team** in Microsoft Teams. [See who's on a team or in a channel ](https://support.office.com/article/see-who-s-on-a-team-or-in-a-channel-5c6be9be-9c45-4a0f-a1a0-f332b23cb6b7) has more details.

To identify guest users:

1.	Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center.
2.	Select **Admin centers** > **Teams & Skype**.
3.	In the Microsoft Teams & Skype Admin Center, select **Users**. You will see **guest** appended to the display name of any guest users.
  
You can also identify guest users from within a team that you own.
