# View and reset a conference ID assigned to a user in Microsoft Teams

A conferencing ID is automatically assigned to a Microsoft Teams user when they are set up for Audio Conferencing in Office 365 and use Microsoft as the audio conferencing provider. The conference ID assigned is sent in the meeting invite when the meeting is scheduled. Each meeting that a user schedules will get assigned a unique conference ID. 
  
Although a conference ID will be automatically created and assigned to a user, there may be times when a user doesn't want to use this one and you want to set it to a certain number, or when your users can't remember or have lost their conference ID. You can use Microsoft Teams admin center or Windows PowerShell to view, change, and reset their conference ID.
  
An email will be sent to the user with the conference ID and the default audio conferencing phone numbers, or if you reset the conference ID a different email will be sent that will include the conference ID but not a PIN. For more information about resetting a conference organizer's PIN, [go here](reset-a-conference-id-for-a-user-in-teams.md).

## What else should you know?

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >  After a new conference ID is created or one is reset, the old conference ID can't be used by callers. You should notify users to reschedule their existing meeting invites to make sure the new conference ID is added to the invitations. 
  
    
- The conference ID must meet the length in digits set on the audio conferencing bridge. You can't use alphabetic or special characters in conference IDs; only numbers can be used.
    
- The conference ID for all of your audio conferencing users will be 7 digits by default, and the number of digits can't be changed.
