## Set the policies to upgrade to the new Teams client

As an admin, you can manage how new Teams to your users.

To control which users can see the toggle, use the Teams admin setting **UseNewTeamsClient** under the **TeamsUpdateManagement** policy.

Manage this setting in the **Teams Admin Center** or using **Teams PowerShell**.</br>

## [**Teams Admin Center**](#tab/teams-admin-center)

Configure setting via Teams Admin Center.

### Policy settings for upgrade

   |Setting|Description|
   |:-----|:-----|
   |Not enabled|Use this value to hide the new Teams toggle switch. Users won't be able to opt in to the new Teams.|
   |Classic Teams as default|Use this value to have classic Teams the default version. The new Teams toggle switch displays to let users opt into the new Teams and switch back if needed. **Note:** This option was previously called *Users can choose*.|
   |Microsoft controlled| Default. The value lets Microsoft control whether the new Teams toggle switch is shown or not based on product readiness|
   |New Teams as default </br>Rollout for the feature began in early August  2023 | Use this value to make new Teams the default version. Users can switch back to classic Teams using the toggle.|
   |New Teams only (Rolling out end of January 2024) |Use this value to make new Teams the default version and uninstall classic Teams. Users don't have the option to switch back to classic Teams.|

In addition to PowerShell, you can also use Teams Admin Center to manage the visibility of the toggle on a per-user basis.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com).
2. Select **Teams > Teams Update policies** from the left navigation pane.
3. Select **Add** to create a new policy or select an existing policy to open Update policy.
4. Name the update policy, add a description, and select the setting for “Use new Teams client”, as shown here.

|Setting|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|Not enabled|Use this value to hide the new Teams toggle switch. Users won't be able to opt in to the new Teams.|
|Classic Teams as default|Use this value to have classic Teams the default version. The new Teams toggle switch displays to let users opt into the new Teams and switch back if needed. **Note:** This option was previously called *Users can choose*.|
|New Teams as default|Sets the new Teams as default. **Note:** This option is currently being rolled out|
|**Microsoft controlled**|**Default. Use this value to let Microsoft control the following:</br>-Whether the "Try the new Teams" toggle switch is shown or not</br>- In the future, let Microsoft manage the installation of the new Teams client and </br>Allow Microsoft to determine default client behavior based on the [rollout schedule](new-teams-desktop-admin.md#new-teams-schedule-for-clients).**|

</br>

>[!Note]
>The option "Classic Teams as default" was previously called "Users can choose".

</br>

5.	Select new Teams as default from this setting to ensure users can get the new Teams experience when they launch

6. Once the policy is defined, you can assign it to a **user or user group** with the Group policy assignment. To assign it to a group, select **Group policy assignment** and then **Add**,  or select one of the groups listed.

:::image type="content" source="media/new-teams-update-policies-group.png" alt-text="update policies by group":::

Select a policy to assign to the group.

:::image type="content" source="media/new-teams-update-policies-group-assign.png" alt-text="update policy and assign by group":::

7. Once the policy is defined, you can assign it to a specific user under **Users> Manage users**.

:::image type="content" source="media/new-teams-update-policies-manage-users.png" alt-text="update policy per user":::

   If you update the policy setting in the Teams Admin Center, the new setting can take up to 24 hours to go into effect. The user doesn't have to restart the app.

## [**PowerShell**](#tab/powershell)

Configure the UseNewTeamsClient setting to one of the following possible values:

| Setting | Explanation |
| :----- | :----- |
| MicrosoftChoice | Default setting. This value lets Microsoft control if the Teams (preview) toggle switch is shown based on product readiness. |
|User choice| This value lets the new Teams toggle switch display to all users. Users can choose to opt in or out.|
| AdminDisabled | This value hides the new Teams toggle switch from view. Users won't be able to opt in to the new Teams.| 

Here are the steps needed to configure this setting in PowerShell:

1. Import the latest Teams PowerShell cmdlets (require version 4.9.1 or greater) by following [Manage Teams with Microsoft Teams PowerShell](/microsoftteams/teams-powershell-managing-teams) instructions. Direct link: [PowerShell Gallery Microsoft Teams 4.9.1](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MicrosoftTeams/4.9.1).
2. Connect to an admin account using this command:

```powershell
Connect-MicrosoftTeams
```

3. Once connected and logged in via PowerShell, you can explore the list of related commands:
Enter *-CsTeamsUpdateManagementPolicy and tab through the commands (tab key).

4. Use the following commands to change the existing Update Management policy to opt in the assigned users to allow them to try the new Teams:

```powershell
Set-CsTeamsUpdateManagementPolicy -identity <new_policy_name> -UseNewTeamsClient 
```

UserChoice

Example:

```powershell

Set-CsTeamsUpdateManagementPolicy -identity MySetting -UseNewTeamsClient UserChoice

```

   > [!NOTE]
   > This method for **existing policy modification** doesn't take effect immediately. Allow up to 24 hours for the change to propagate to users. Users don't need to restart the app, but specifically for opt-in, they'll need one restart following a fresh install to see the toggle.

5. Use the following commands to deploy a **new policy** to opt-out a specific user from seeing the toggle:

```powershell

New-CsTeamsUpdateManagementPolicy -identity <new_policy_name> -UseNewTeamsClient AdminDisabled

Grant-CsTeamsUpdateManagementPolicy -identity <user> -PolicyName <new_policy_name>

```

**Example:**

```powershell
New-CsTeamsUpdateManagementPolicy -identity MySetting -UseNewTeamsClient AdminDisabled
Grant-CsTeamsUpdateManagementPolicy -identity admin@contoso.org -PolicyName MySetting
```

  > [!NOTE]
  > Allow up to 24 hours for the **new policy assignment method** to go into effect. Users don't need to restart the app.

### How to uninstall the new Teams client

Any user who was using the new Teams before the policy was implemented can manually opt out by using the new Teams toggle.

After they opt out, the toggle won't appear when they relaunch Teams. To prevent users from using this client and want to uninstall the client, users can manually uninstall it from settings.

</br>

#### Remove new Teams for all users

To remove the new Teams from all users' computers, use the following PowerShell command:

```powershell

Remove-AppxPackage 
```

PowerShell cmdlet to remove new Teams from all users on all computers:

```powershell
Get-AppxPackage *MSTeams* -AllUsers |Remove-AppxPackage -AllUsers
```

PowerShell cmdlet for an individual user without administrator privilege:

```powershell
Get-AppxPackage *MSTeams*|Remove-AppxPackage
```

Command to uninstall teams machine-wide:
teamsbootstrapper.exe -x -m

> [!NOTE]
> If you've set Teams update policy to **Not enabled**, but users still received new Teams client with M365 Apps, please follow instructions in our [How to uninstall the new Teams client](new-teams-deploy-using-policies.md#how-to-uninstall-the-new-teams-client) article to uninstall it for your users.

#### User settings migration

End user settings are automatically migrated from classic Teams to new Teams during the intial switch.  

>[!Note]
>Settings are only migrated once, the first time a user updates to new Teams. After that, no incremental migrations of setting changes will occur if the user switches back and forth between classic and new Teams.
