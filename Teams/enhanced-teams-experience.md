# Microsoft Teams Premium - Overview for administrators

![Information icon](media/info.png) **Most of the features described in this article require Teams Premium, which is a preview release.** A few features, for example, some webinar features, are available with other licenses as well. For details about feature availability and licensing, see [Teams Premium licensing](teams-add-on-licensing/licensing-enhance-teams.md).

This article is for IT Pros and administrators who will be deploying and configuring Teams Premium features. The article provides a brief description of the features, with links to more detailed documentation.

Teams Premium is an add-on license that provides the following enhancements to Teams:  

-	Enhanced meeting experiences for your end users
-	Enhanced security and protection for meetings 
-	Enhanced administrative and telemetry support


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because Teams Premium is a public preview release, at general availability, some features currently available with Teams will only be available with a Teams Premium license. 

The following sections describe the Teams Premium enhancements for:

- [Protected meetings](#protected-meetings)
- [Custom meetings](#custom-meetings)
- [Premium events](#premium-events)
- [Virtual Appointments](#advanced-virtual-appointments)

> [!Note]
>We will continue to update this article. Check back often for links to new content.

## Protected meetings

Teams Premium provides additional ways to safeguard meetings with the following key features: 

- **Sensitivity labels** - Extended capabilities for sensitivity labels to control meeting settings normally controlled by the meeting organizer. These capabilities include new settings to control lobby, chat, chat copy, presentation, and recording functions.

- **Watermarking** - Enforced through a sensitivity label. Watermarks display the email address of a meeting participant, which is useful for protecting confidential information shared in meetings. 

- **End-to-end encryption** - Enforced through a sensitivity label. End-to-end encryption provides increased security for meetings that require a higher level of protection.
