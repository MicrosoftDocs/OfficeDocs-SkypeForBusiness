# Microsoft Teams Premium - Overview for administrators

![Information icon](media/info.png) **Most of the features described in this article require Teams Premium.** A few features, for example, some webinar features, are available with other licenses as well. For details about feature availability and licensing, see [Teams Premium licensing](teams-add-on-licensing/licensing-enhance-teams.md).

This article is for IT Pros and administrators who will be deploying and configuring Teams Premium features. The article provides a brief description of the features, with links to more detailed documentation.

Teams Premium is an add-on license that provides the following enhancements to Teams:  

- Enhanced meeting experiences for your end users
- Enhanced security and protection for meetings
- Enhanced administrative and telemetry support

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Now that Teams Premium has reached general availability, some features formerly available with Teams will only be available with a Teams Premium license.
>
> For admins to be able to manage Teams Premium features, their tenant needs at least one user with an active [Teams Premium license](/MicrosoftTeams/teams-add-on-licensing/licensing-enhance-teams).

The following sections describe the Teams Premium enhancements for:

- [Protected meetings](#protected-meetings)
- [Custom meetings](#custom-meetings)

## Protected meetings

Teams Premium provides additional ways to safeguard meetings with the following key features:

- **Sensitivity labels** - Extended capabilities for sensitivity labels to control meeting settings normally controlled by the meeting organizer. These capabilities include new settings to control lobby, chat, chat copy, presentation, and recording functions.

- **Watermarking** - Enforced through a sensitivity label. Watermarks display the email address of a meeting participant, which is useful for protecting confidential information shared in meetings.

- **End-to-end encryption** - Enforced through a sensitivity label. End-to-end encryption provides increased security for meetings that require a higher level of protection.
