# Microsoft Teams monitoring and alerting

New monitoring and alerting capabilities for Microsoft Teams are available in the Teams admin center. Use different sets of rules available under the **Notifications & alerts** section in the Teams admin center to monitor Teams capabilities and receive alerts. For example, you can actively monitor the health of Teams devices such as IP Phones, collaboration bars, and others if they unexpectedly go offline.  

Your organization can use Teams monitoring and alerting to do the following items:

- Automatically manage Teams capabilities
- Be alerted if they show something unexpected.
- Take corrective actions to get things back on-track.

## How to manage monitoring and alerting

 You must be a global admin in Microsoft 365 or a Teams service admin to configure alerting rules. See [Use Teams administrator roles to manage Teams](../using-admin-roles.md) to learn more about Teams admin roles and which reports each admin role can access.

1. Sign in to the Teams admin center.
2. From the left navigation, select **Notifications & alerts**.
3. Choose the rule you want to configure from **Rules**.
