# Auto attendant and Call queue historical reports

> [!IMPORTANT]
> GCC High and DoD customers need to use [Auto attendant and call queue historical reports for GCC High and DoD](aa-cq-cqd-historical-reports-v164.md)

This Power BI template provides three reports that allow organizations to report on the number of calls processed by Auto attendants and Call queues.  It also provides agent performance insights.

## V3.1.3 published on September 13, 2023

The Teams Auto Attendant & Call Queue Historical Report Power BI template provides the following three reports:

- The Auto Attendant report shows analytics for calls coming into your Auto attendants.
  - [Original](media/aa-cq-historical-report-sample-aa-v310-orig.png)
  - [New (as of v3.1.0)](media/aa-cq-historical-report-sample-aa-v310-new.png)

- The Call Queue report shows analytics for calls coming into your Call queues.

  - [New (as of v3.1.0)](media/aa-cq-historical-report-sample-cq-v310-new.png)

- The Agent Timeline report shows a timeline view of agents being active in Call queue calls.

  - [New (as of v3.1.0)](media/aa-cq-historical-report-sample-at-v310-new.png)

These reports use data from the Voice Applications Analytics Collector (VAAC) service.

## V3.x.x prerequisites

### Power BI Desktop

You need to have Power BI Desktop installed. You can install and use the free version from the [Microsoft Windows Store](https://aka.ms/pbidesktopstore).

The minimum compatible version is 2.85.681.0 (September 2020).

### Power BI Service

These reports may be [published to the Power BI service](/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-upload-desktop-files).

Once the report is published:

1. Go to the dataset **Settings**.
2. Expand the **Data source credentials** section.
3. Select **Edit credentials**.
4. Set the **Authentication method** to `OAuth2`.
5. Ensure **Skip test connection** is enabled.
6. Select **Sign in** and provide your credentials.

When completed, you're able to [configure a scheduled refresh](/power-bi/connect-data/refresh-scheduled-refresh) of the dataset.

### Permissions to access the CQD pipeline

While this version of the reports doesn't use the Call Quality Dashboard (CQD) data pipeline, the account used to view the historical data still requires access to the Call Quality Dashboard. For more information, see [CQD access role](./turning-on-and-using-call-quality-dashboard.md#assign-admin-roles-for-access-to-cqd).

Any CQD role with both **View Reports** and **View EUII fields** set to **Yes** will work.

This requirement will be removed in a future release.

## V3.x.x desktop installation

The following steps assume you have already installed Power BI Desktop on your computer and that your account has the necessary permissions to access the CQD data pipeline.

Perform the following steps:

1. Download and save the [Teams Auto Attendant & Call Queue Historical Reports V3.1.3.zip](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=104623) file on your computer.

2. Open the zip file.

3. Open the `Teams Auto Attendant & Call Queue Historical Reports V3.1.3.pbit` template file. Power BI Desktop should launch.

4. You're prompted to select the **DataSource** and **UTC Offset**.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/aa-cq-historical-report-01-v312.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the DataSource and UTC Offset selections.":::

    - **DataSource**: Select the `api.interfaces.records.teams.microsoft.com` entry.
    - **UTC Offset**: Select the UTC offset that represents the time zone the reports are presented in.

5. You're prompted to sign in with an account. Select **Organizational account**, and then select **Sign in**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/aa-cq-historical-report-03-v300.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing sign-in for V3.0.0.":::

6. Select **Connect**, and the data refreshes.

> [!NOTE]
> If you were using v1.63 or earlier, you may encounter an error when v3.x.x tries to retrieve the data from VAAC.  To resolve this error, it's necessary to clear any previous credentials from Power BI.
>
> 1. Open the v3.x.x template to clear the error.
> 1. Select **File** > **Options & Settings** > **Data source settings**.
> 1. Select the dropdown menu for **Clear Permissions**, and then select **Clear All Permissions**.
> 1. Close the template after they're cleared, and restart Power BI. You'll be asked to authorize again.

## Data latency for Auto attendant and Call queue analytics

The data is available within 30 minutes of the call being completed, but there are cases where it can take several hours for the data to appear.

You have to refresh the data to see any new data.

> [!NOTE]
> When a call arrives at the first Call queue, if the number of calls already waiting in that queue has reached the **Call overflow handling** limit and if the redirect option sends new calls to a second Call queue, then the agents in the second Call queue will be shown as being in the first Call queue on this report. 

## Data Limits

Each report tab is restricted to retrieving 90,000 rows. If there's a large number of calls being processed each day, it's possible that the report won't show all calls for all days within the selected date range.  There is no notification when this occurs.  Try shortening the date range to avoid this issue.

If shortening the date range is not sufficient, it is possible to increase the number of rows that can be retrieved by modifying the report as follows:

1. Right click on the "fAutoAttendant" field on the right, click "Edit Query".
2. Right click on "CommonQueryParameters" and click "Advanced Editor".
3. Change the "LimitedResultRowsCount" to a larger number.
4. Save the report.

The maximum number of rows that can be retuned is 200,000.  Setting the value to a number higher than this will have no effect as this is a hard-coded limit.

Increasing the limit will result in longer response times.

## Known issues

- Only the calls and caller actions in the first Auto attendant or Call queue that answers the call are reported on.  Calls and caller actions in chained Auto attendants (when one Auto attendant transfers to another Auto attendant) or chained Call queues (when one Call queue transfers to another Call queue) aren't reported on. 

- Call queues and Auto attendants are shown by the resource account's ID instead of Call queue or Auto attendant names.  To show all the traffic for an Auto attendant or Call queue, you must select all the resource accounts assigned to the Auto attendant or Call queue.

- Only 28 days of call history are available. Call queue and Auto attendant data is considered personal data and is subject to data privacy retention policies.

- In some scenarios, the agent answered call count on the **Cloud Call Queue Agent Timeline** report may be different than the number of calls shown in the Teams client call history. The Teams client call history is correct. Support is investigating, but there's no estimated time to repair available at this time.

## Customization

## Dimensions and measurements

The following dimensions and measurements are available to be used.

### Common dimensions

These dimensions are common to both Auto attendants and Call queues:

### Constructing a valid query

A valid query consists of several attributes in a JSON object:

```json
{
   "Filters":[
      {
         "DataModelName":"Date",
         "Value":"2022-04-01",
         "Operand":4
      },
      {
         "DataModelName":"Date",
         "Value":"2022-04-30",
         "Operand":6
      }
   ],
   "Dimensions":[
      {
         "DataModelName":"AutoAttendantIdentity"
      },
      {
         "DataModelName":"AutoAttendantDirectorySearchMethod"
      }
   ],
   "Measurements":[
      {
         "DataModelName":"PSTNTotalMinutes"
      },
      {
         "DataModelName":"TotalCallCount"
      }
   ],
   "Parameters":{
      "UserAgent":"Power BI Desktop"
   },
   "LimitResultRowsCount":100000
}
```

#### Required fields

- Filters: used to filter data returned by VAAC
  - DataModelName should be one of the supported dimensions
  - Value should be in the correct format (datetime, string, number etc.)
  - Operands:
    - 0 - Equals
    - 1 - Not Equals
    - 2 - Contains
    - 3 - Begins With
    - 4 - Greater Than
    - 5 - Greater Than or Equal To
    - 6 - Less Than
    - 7 - Less Than or Equal To
    - 8 - Does Not Contain
    - 9 - Does Not Begin With

- Dimensions:
  - DataModelName should be one of the supported dimensions

- Measurements:
  - DataModelName should be one of the supported measurements

- Parameters: Currently only UserAgent is supported.

- LimitResultRowsCount: the max count of rows returned by VAAC

## Accessing VAAC outside of Power BI

Any application that can access RESTful web services can use the VAAC API to retrieve historical data. In the following example, [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is used.
  
### Preparation

1. Download [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
1. Import the folder `postman` in the [downloaded zip file](#v3xx-desktop-installation) instructions into Postman. 

:::image type="content" source="media/aa-cq-historical-report-postman-01.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing import completed" lightbox="media/aa-cq-historical-report-postman-01.png":::

### Accessing VAAC using Postman

1. Select **VAAC - msit** on the top right ***No Environment*** drop-down.
2. Select **Environments** on the left hand rail menu.
3. Select **VAAC - msit** under **Globals**.
4. Replace **userName**, **password** and **tenantId** with the applicable credentials.
5. Select **Reset All** in the top right corner.
6. Select **Save**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/aa-cq-historical-report-postman-02.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing username, password and tenant ID fields configured" lightbox="media/aa-cq-historical-report-postman-02.png":::

7. Select **Collections** on the left hand rail menu.
8. Select **Config API Access Token - Prod** and navigate to the **Body** tab.
9. Select **Send**.

   An access token is returned.

   :::image type="content" source="media/aa-cq-historical-report-postman-03.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing result with access token returned" lightbox="media/aa-cq-historical-report-postman-03.png":::

   If an access token isn't returned, check your credentials to make they have [sufficient permissions](#permissions-to-access-the-cqd-pipeline).

10. Select **VAAC ConfigAPI Prod** and navigate to the **Params** tab.

    - [Compress](#compress-the-json-query) the query as outlined
    - [URL encode](#url-encode-the-compressed-json-query) the compressed result as outlined

11. Fill in your [query](#constructing-a-valid-query) string.
12. Select **Send**.

### Reading the result

After you submit your input, there will be a couple of possible results:

- If the input is invalid, an error message with the actual reason is returned
- If the input is valid, the result looks like this:

   :::image type="content" source="media/aa-cq-historical-report-postman-04.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing query result with dataResult field" lightbox="media/aa-cq-historical-report-postman-04.png" :::

   In this case, the data is in the "dataResult" field in the same order requested in the query dimension and measurements attributes.

### Compress the JSON query

The VAAC API only accepts GZip-compressed or Base64-encoded strings as input.

Find any website to compress the JSON blob using GZIP or Base64.

- GZIP: (https://www.multiutil.com/text-to-gzip-compress/)
- Base64: (https://www.multiutil.com/text-to-base64-converter/)

GZIP output should look like this:

### URL-Encode the compressed JSON query

The GZIP or Base64 compressed JSON query must be [URL encoded](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/).

GZIP URL encoded output looks like this:
