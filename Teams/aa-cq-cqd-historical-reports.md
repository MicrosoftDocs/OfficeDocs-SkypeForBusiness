# Auto Attendant & Call Queue Historical Report

The Teams Auto Attendant & Call Queue Historical Report Power BI Template provides the following three reports:

- [Auto Attendant](media/cqd-teams-aa-cq-historical-report-sample-aa.png) – showing analytics for calls coming into your Auto Attendants.
- [Call Queue](media/cqd-teams-aa-cq-historical-report-sample-cq.png) – showing analytics for calls coming into your Call Queues.
- [Agent Timeline](media/cqd-teams-aa-cq-historical-report-sample-at.png) – showing a timeline view of agents being active in Call Queue calls.

These reports use data from the [Call Quality Dashboard](CQD-Power-BI-query-templates.md) data store. The reports allow organizations
to report on the number of calls being processed by auto attendants and call queues.  The reports also provide insight to agent performance in the call queues.

### V1.63 published on August 24, 2022

## Prerequisites

### Power BI Desktop
You need to have Power BI Desktop installed. You can install it from the [Microsoft Windows Store](https://aka.ms/pbidesktopstore).

You can use the free version of Power BI Desktop. The minimum compatible version is 2.85.681.0 (September 2020).

### Permissions to access the CQD pipeline

The account you use to view the historical report needs to have permissions to access the CQD data pipeline. For more information, see [CQD access role](./turning-on-and-using-call-quality-dashboard.md#assign-admin-roles-for-access-to-cqd).

## Installation 

The following steps assume you've already installed Power BI Desktop on your computer, and that your account has the necessary permissions to access the CQD data pipeline.

Perform the following steps:

- Download the [CQD Power BI Query Templates](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=102291) and save the zip file to a directory on your computer.

- Double-click on the zip file to open it.

- Double-click on the "CQD Teams Auto Attendant & Call Queue Historical Report V1.60.pbit" template file. The Power BI Desktop should launch.

- You'll be prompted to select the CQD data pipeline region. Select the region where your tenant is located.

  :::image type="content" source="media/cqd-teams-aa-cq-historical-report-01.png" alt-text="Screenshot selecting the CQD data pipeline region.":::

- The region where your tenant is located can be obtained by using the [Get-CsTenant](/powershell/module/skype/get-cstenant) cmdlet.

    ```PowerShell
    (Get-CsTenant).ServiceInstance


    microsoftcommunicationsonline/noam-4a-s7
    ```

    - The region will be displayed after the **/** as in the above example where the region is: noam

 - The report will launch with sample data.
 
 - To see your own data, select **Refresh** in the Home tab under Queries in Power BI Desktop.

   :::image type="content" source="media/cqd-teams-aa-cq-historical-report-02.png" alt-text="Screenshot selecting the refresh option.":::

- You'll be prompted to sign in. Select **Organizational account** and then select **Sign in**.

  :::image type="content" source="media/cqd-teams-aa-cq-historical-report-03.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing login.":::

- Select **Connect** and watch the data refresh.

## Data latency and AA & CQ analytics

Data is typically available within 30 minutes of the call completing; however, there are occasions where it may take several hours for data to appear. 

You will have to refresh the data to see any new data.

## Customization 

You can customize certain visualization aspects of the reports, such as adding or removing fields to be shown in the various visualizations, changing chart type, and so on.

The report contains all the data metrics currently available.

### Change color schema 

The following steps assume you have already completed the installation steps.

Perform the following steps:
- Select **View tab** on the ribbon.

  :::image type="content" source="media/cqd-teams-aa-cq-historical-report-04.png" alt-text="Screenshot selecting view tab to change color scheme.":::

- Select the color schema from the drop-down list.

> [!NOTE]
> When a call arrives at the first call queue, if the number of calls already waiting in that queue has reached the **Call overflow handling** limit and if the redirect option sends new calls to a second call queue, then the agents in the second call queue will be shown as being in the first call queue on this report. 

## Known Issues

- Call queue and auto attendants are shown by resource account's ID instead of call queue/auto attendant names.  To show all the traffic for an auto attendant or call queue, you must select all the resource accounts assigned to the auto attendant or call queue.

- Only 28 days of history are available in the dashboard as call queue/auto attendant data is considered personal data and is subject to data privacy retention policies.

- In some scenarios, the agent answered call count on the Cloud Call Queue Agent Timeline report may be different than the number of calls shown in the Teams client call history. The Teams client call history is correct. Support is investigating but there is no estimated time to repair available at this time.

- <sup>1</sup> **Incoming call source** in the auto attendant and call queue graphs show the final call leg source rather than the initial call leg source. For example, if an auto attendant receives an external call and transfers the call to another auto attendant or call queue, the **Incoming call source** will be reported as Internal.
