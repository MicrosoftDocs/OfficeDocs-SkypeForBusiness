# Auto attendant and Call queue historical reports

> [!IMPORTANT]
> GCC High and DoD customers need to use [Auto attendant and call queue historical reports for GCC High and DoD](aa-cq-cqd-historical-reports-v164.md).

This Power BI template provides three reports that allow organizations to report on the number of calls processed by Auto attendants and Call queues. It also provides agent performance insights.

## V3.1.7 published on July 15, 2024

The Teams Auto Attendant & Call Queue Historical Report Power BI template provides the following three reports:

- The [Auto Attendant](media/aa-cq-historical-report-sample-aa-v316-new.png) report shows analytics for calls coming into your Auto attendants.
- The [Call Queue](media/aa-cq-historical-report-sample-cq-v316-new.png) report shows analytics for calls coming into your Call queues.
- The [Agent Timeline](media/aa-cq-historical-report-sample-at-v316-new.png) report shows a timeline view of agents being active in Call queue calls.

These reports use data from the Voice Applications Analytics Collector (VAAC) service.

## V3.x.x prerequisites

### Power BI Desktop

You need to have Power BI Desktop installed. You can install and use the free version from the [Microsoft Windows Store](https://aka.ms/pbidesktopstore).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Power BI Desktop is updated and released on a monthly basis, incorporating customer feedback and new features. Only the most recent version of Power BI Desktop is supported; customers who contact support for Power BI Desktop will be asked to upgrade to the most recent version. You can get the most recent version of Power BI Desktop from the [Windows Store](https://aka.ms/pbidesktopstore), or as a single executable containing all supported languages that you [download](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=58494) and install on your computer.

### Power BI Service

These reports can be [published to the Power BI service](/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-upload-desktop-files).

Once the report is published:

1. Go to the dataset **Settings**.
2. Expand the **Data source credentials** section.
3. Select **Edit credentials**.
4. Set the **Authentication method** to `OAuth2`.
5. Ensure **Skip test connection** is enabled.
6. Select **Sign in** and provide your credentials.

When completed, you're able to [configure a scheduled refresh](/power-bi/connect-data/refresh-scheduled-refresh) of the dataset.

### Access permissions

Use one of the following methods to control access to the historical reports:

1. Voice applications policy

To control which Auto attendants, Call queues and Agents users can report on without providing them access to Teams admin center, create a voice applications policy that grants them access to historical reporting and assign them as an Authorized user to the appropriate Auto attendants and Call queues.

For more information, see [Plan for Auto attendant and Call queue authorized users](./aa-cq-authorized-users-plan.md).

> [!TIP]
> Using the voice applications policy to control access is the recommended approach.  With the voice applications policy and Authorized users it is possible to control which Auto attendants, Call queues, and Agents a user can report on. If necessary, the policy still allows a user to report on all Auto attendants, Call queues, and Agents without providing access to Teams admin Center.

Create, or modify, a voice applications policy that enables the historical reporting permissions. Assign the policy to the appropriate users. Assign the users as authorized users to the appropriate auto attendants and call queues. For more information, see [Manage voice applications policies in Microsoft Teams](./manage-voice-applications-policies.md)

The historical reporting permissions can only be set through PowerShell and will be available in Teams admin center later this year. 

For more information, see:

|New voice applications policy           |Existing voice applications policy |
|:---------------------------------------|:----------------------------------|
| [New-CsTeamsVoiceApplicationsPolicy/-HistoricalAutoAttendantMetricsPermission](/powershell/module/teams/new-csteamsvoiceapplicationspolicy#-HistoricalAutoAttendantMetricsPermission)  | [Set-CsTeamsVoiceApplicationsPolicy/-HistoricalAutoAttendantMetricsPermission](/powershell/module/teams/set-csteamsvoiceapplicationspolicy#-HistoricalAutoAttendantMetricsPermission) |
| [New-CsTeamsVoiceApplicationsPolicy/-HistoricalCallQueueMetricsPermission](/powershell/module/teams/new-csteamsvoiceapplicationspolicy#-HistoricalCallQueueMetricsPermission)  | [Set-CsTeamsVoiceApplicationsPolicy/-HistoricalCallQueueMetricsPermission](/powershell/module/teams/set-csteamsvoiceapplicationspolicy#-HistoricalCallQueueMetricsPermission) |
| [New-CsTeamsVoiceApplicationsPolicy/--HistoricalAgentMetricsPermission](/powershell/module/teams/new-csteamsvoiceapplicationspolicy#--HistoricalAgentMetricsPermission)  | [Set-CsTeamsVoiceApplicationsPolicy/-HistoricalCallQueueMetricsPermission](/powershell/module/teams/set-csteamsvoiceapplicationspolicy#--HistoricalAgentMetricsPermission) |

#### Known Issue

If the voice applications policy assigned to a user only enables the historical reporting permissions, and optionally the real-time reporting permissions, then the user can't access the historical reports. Support is working to resolve this problem. In the interim, enable at least one Auto attendant and Call queue change permission in the policy. Enabling the Auto attendant **Business hours greeting** and Call queue **Welcome greeting** is suggested, but enabling any of the change permissions will work around this issue.

2. Call Quality Dashboard (CQD) pipeline [legacy]

If you want the user to report on **all** the Auto attendants, Call queues, and Agents in the tenant and you want to grant the user access to Teams admin center to run other Usage reports, assign the user a CQD access role with both **View Reports** and **View EUII fields** set to **Yes**.

For more information, see [CQD access role](./turning-on-and-using-call-quality-dashboard.md#assign-admin-roles-for-access-to-cqd).

> [!NOTE]
> If a user is assigned a CQD access role and a voice applications policy, the CQD role will take precendence and the user will see all the Auto attendants, Call queues and Agents in the tenant.

## V3.x.x desktop installation

The following steps assume the Power BI Desktop client is installed on your computer and that your account has the necessary permissions to access the CQD data pipeline.

Perform the following steps:

1. Download and save the [Teams Auto Attendant & Call Queue Historical Reports V3.1.7.zip](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=104623) file on your computer.

2. Open the zip file.

3. Open the `Teams Auto Attendant & Call Queue Historical Reports V3.1.7.pbit` template file. Power BI Desktop should launch.

4. Select the **DataSource**, **Report Level**, and **UTC Offset**.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/aa-cq-historical-report-01-v317.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the DataSource, Report Level, and UTC Offset selections.":::

    - **DataSource**: Select the `api.interfaces.records.teams.microsoft.com` entry.
    - **Report Level**:
        - Select `Per Call` (default) to retrieve all the individual call records.
        - Select `Per Day` to retrieve an aggregated total for each day. 
    - **UTC Offset**: Select the UTC offset that represents the time zone the reports are presented in. Only valid when the **Report Level** is set to `Per Call`

    #### Per Day vs Per Call 

   - Per Call reporting retrieves the individual call records for each Auto attendant, Call queue, and Agent, the user is authorized for and makes them available in the Power BI client. Per Call reporting also allows call records to be displayed in the local time zone selected by the user. For some customers, especially those using the CQD access role to control access, this may result in hitting the 90,000 default or 200,000 per query record limit. In this case, the Per Day reporting option should be selected.

    - Per Day reporting retrieves one daily summary record for each Auto attendant, Call queue, and Agent. This results in fewer records being returned to the client, reducing the possibility of hitting the 90,000 default or 200,000 per query record limit. Per Day reporting is based on a UTC-00:00 day (00:00:00-23:59:59 UTC) only and any UTC offset supplied by the user is ignored.

5. Sign in with your Teams account.
   - Select **File**, then **Options and settings**, and then **Data source settings**.
   - Select **Edit Permissions**, and then **Edit**.
   - Select **Organizational account**, and then **Sign in**.
   - Select **Save**, then **OK**, and then **Close**.

     :::image type="content" source="media/aa-cq-historical-report-03-v301.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing sign-in for V3.x.x.":::

6. Select **Refresh**, in the ribbon bar and the data refreshes.

## Data latency for Auto attendant and Call queue analytics

The data is typically available within 30 minutes of the call being completed, but there are cases where it can take several hours for the data to appear.

You have to refresh the report to see any new data.

1. Only 28 days of call history are available. Call queue and Agent data is considered personal data and is subject to data privacy retention policies.
1. The Call queues resource account ID's name instead of Call queue name is shown.  To show all the traffic for a Call queue, you must select all the resource accounts assigned to the Call queue.
1. The Agent's UPN name instead of their name is shown.
1. The Date selector sometimes shows dates outside the range of available data resulting in a blank report. Change the dates to be within the last 28 days to resolve the issue.
1. In some scenarios, the agent answered call count might be different than the number of calls shown in the Teams client call history. The Teams client call history is correct. Support is investigating, but there's no estimated time to repair available at this time.
1. When an agent answers a call in a different call queue due to redirection through Call Overflow exception handling, they are displayed in the original call queue where the exception occurred instead of the one they answered the call in.

## Data Limits

Each report tab retrieves data for all Auto attendants, Call queues, or agents the user is authorized for in the tenant for the selected date range. This data retrieval occurs regardless of the specific Resource Accounts or Agent selected on the report. Filtering to show only the requested information occurs locally. 

**Each report tab is restricted to retrieving 90,000 rows.**

If there's a large number of calls being processed each day, it's possible that the report won't show all calls for all days within the selected date range. There's no notification when this exclusion occurs. Try shortening the date range to avoid this issue.

If shortening the date range isn't sufficient, it's possible to increase the number of rows that can be retrieved by modifying the report as follows:

1. Select **Transform data** in the ribbon bar to open the Power Query Editor.
1. Select **LimitResultRowsCount** on the left-hand side.
1. Change the value in the field to the right to a larger number.
1. Close the Power Query Editor window.
1. Select **Yes** when prompted to apply the changes now. The report should automatically refresh.
1. Save your report.

**The maximum number of rows that can be returned is 200,000.**

Setting the value to a number higher than 200,000 has no effect as this value is a hard-coded limit on the server.

Increasing the limit results in longer execution and response times.

## Report Execution Time Limits

Increasing the maximum number of rows that can be returned results in longer execution and response times meaning the report might time out before the data can be returned.  The report execution time can be increased by modifying the report as follows:

1. Select on the **Transform data** in the ribbon bar to open the Power Query Editor.
1. Select on **ReportExecutionMinutes** on the left-hand side.
1. Change the value in the field to the right to a larger number.
1. Close the Power Query Editor window.
1. Select **Yes** when prompted to apply the changes now. The report should automatically refresh.
1. Save your report.

### Constructing a valid query

A valid query consists of several attributes in a JSON object:

```json
{
   "Filters":[
      {
         "DataModelName":"Date",
         "Value":"2022-04-01",
         "Operand":4
      },
      {
         "DataModelName":"Date",
         "Value":"2022-04-30",
         "Operand":6
      }
   ],
   "Dimensions":[
      {
         "DataModelName":"AutoAttendantIdentity"
      },
      {
         "DataModelName":"AutoAttendantDirectorySearchMethod"
      }
   ],
   "Measurements":[
      {
         "DataModelName":"PSTNTotalMinutes"
      },
      {
         "DataModelName":"TotalCallCount"
      }
   ],
   "Parameters":{
      "UserAgent":"Power BI Desktop"
   },
   "LimitResultRowsCount":100000
}
```

#### Required fields

- **Filters**: used to filter data returned by VAAC
  - DataModelName should be one of the supported dimensions
  - Value should be in the correct format (datetime, string, number etc.)
  - *Operands*:
    - 0 - Equals
    - 1 - Not Equals
    - 2 - Contains
    - 3 - Begins With
    - 4 - Greater Than
    - 5 - Greater Than or Equal To
    - 6 - Less Than
    - 7 - Less Than or Equal To
    - 8 - Does Not Contain
    - 9 - Does Not Begin With

- **Dimensions**:
  - DataModelName should be one of the supported dimensions

- **Measurements**:
  - DataModelName should be one of the supported measurements

- **Parameters**: Currently only UserAgent is supported.

- **LimitResultRowsCount**: the max count of rows returned by VAAC

## Accessing VAAC outside of Power BI

Any application that can access RESTful web services can use the VAAC API to retrieve historical data. In the following example, [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is used.
  
### Preparation

1. Download [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
1. Import the folder `postman` in the [downloaded zip file](#v3xx-desktop-installation) instructions into Postman.

:::image type="content" source="media/aa-cq-historical-report-postman-01.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing import completed" lightbox="media/aa-cq-historical-report-postman-01.png":::

### Accessing VAAC using Postman

1. Select **VAAC - msit** on the top right ***No Environment*** drop-down.
2. Select **Environments** on the left hand rail menu.
3. Select **VAAC - msit** under **Globals**.
4. Replace **userName**, **password**, and **tenantId** with the applicable credentials.
5. Select **Reset All** in the top right corner.
6. Select **Save**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/aa-cq-historical-report-postman-02.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing username, password and tenant ID fields configured" lightbox="media/aa-cq-historical-report-postman-02.png":::

7. Select **Collections** on the left hand rail menu.
8. Select **Config API Access Token - Prod** and navigate to the **Body** tab.
9. Select **Send**.

   An access token is returned.

   :::image type="content" source="media/aa-cq-historical-report-postman-03.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing result with access token returned." lightbox="media/aa-cq-historical-report-postman-03.png":::

   If an access token isn't returned, check your credentials to make they have [sufficient permissions](#access-permissions).

10. Select **VAAC ConfigAPI Prod** and navigate to the **Params** tab.

    - [Compress](#compress-the-json-query) the query as outlined
    - [URL encode](#url-encode-the-compressed-json-query) the compressed result as outlined

11. Fill in your [query](#constructing-a-valid-query) string.
12. Select **Send**.

### Reading the result

After you submit your input, there are a couple of possible results:

- If the input is invalid, an error message with the actual reason is returned
- If the input is valid, the result looks like this:

   :::image type="content" source="media/aa-cq-historical-report-postman-04.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing query result with dataResult field" lightbox="media/aa-cq-historical-report-postman-04.png":::

   In this case, the data is in the "dataResult" field in the same order requested in the query dimension and measurements attributes.

### Compress the JSON query

The VAAC API only accepts GZip-compressed or Base64-encoded strings as input.

Find any website to compress the JSON blob using GZIP or Base64.

- [GZIP](https://www.multiutil.com/text-to-gzip-compress/)
- [Base64](https://www.multiutil.com/text-to-base64-converter/)

### URL-Encode the compressed JSON query

The GZIP or Base64 compressed JSON query must be [URL encoded](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/).

GZIP URL encoded output looks like this:

```console
H4sIAAAAAAAACq2SQWsCMRCF7%2F6KkLNC3EoPe9u6FISuFbW9lB4GM9TQbEaSCSLif%2B9mV4uCBwXnMkze5L0vkH1PCCFfjWX0QeZfaWxqf%2BxJLIGhIo12CjXKPM0o%2B2cLn2BjEjKVZQM1Gqjhhfy%2BQQ9Oy3x0PDz0H5HypK6nPJ9SUv9uV2RpanTBkLvxiUVkKpjRaXA80ejY8E7eg3%2FhUBqPKya%2FWyD41bpCXpP%2BtzvjrBBC9NjA8o2ks8VyuiQGWxkXGcNdkO3FMVg7puj4GtAMfLPa%2FY2Tk%2FwI6IufhjHl0xa9eJmIEsMv06Y16cLlm6kNzzFEy3Pahi4kH6pUvcMfrAhUU3oCAAA%3D
