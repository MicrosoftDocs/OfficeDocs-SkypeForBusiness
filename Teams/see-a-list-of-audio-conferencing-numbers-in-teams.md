# See a list of Audio Conferencing numbers in Microsoft Teams

When you set up Audio Conferencing for your Microsoft Teams users, you can see the phone numbers that are available to them for audio conferencing. This list has all the audio conferencing phone numbers that are available to your organization.

**Looking for prices?** Review the **Audio Conferencing rates** section in [Audio Conferencing](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/audio-conferencing).
  
When there's only one phone number available in your organization, it serves as the default number for all of your users. When multiple phone numbers are available, you can select the default phone number for each user. The default number is included in Microsoft Teams meeting invitations.
  
To change the dial-in phone number for a single user, see [Set the phone numbers included on invites](set-the-phone-numbers-included-on-invites-in-teams.md).

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [updating-admin-interfaces](includes/updating-admin-interfaces.md)]

## See your audio conferencing phone numbers in the Teams admin center

Using the Microsoft Teams admin center:

1. In the left navigation, go to **Meetings** > **Conference bridges**.
2. View the phone numbers that are available for audio conferencing.

      - You can also see the location and primary language that the audio conferencing auto attendant uses.
