Microsoft Teams provides localized language support for T-Bot and help content. New languages are being added all the time. For the most current list of supported languages, see [Microsoft Teams supported languages for help content](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Microsoft-Teams-supported-languages-for-help-content-9c71d10a-0c5c-49d4-b6d7-0c58cdfdf4cf).

T-Bot also provides alternative assistance methods for the users who will prefer browsing the content instead of asking questions to a bot.
