# Facilitate user adoption of your new online phone system

A phone can be a user’s lifeline. Switching from a traditional phone system to an online phone system represents a significant change in the way users work, and can negatively affect productivity. Taking time to inform, guide, and support users through this change can help ensure a positive user experience and maximize your return on investment.

This article contains customizable email templates to help inform users about their new phone system. Customize and send the appropriate emails to align with your specific voice deployment. We’ve used brackets to indicate sections for easy personalization, but we recommend that you add organization-specific messaging to make the announcement most relevant for your users. If applicable for your deployment, replace all references to “Teams” with “Skype for Business.”

## Email number 1: Send three weeks before launch

Subject line:

```
IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT about your office desk phone
```

Body of email:

```
Instant messaging and online meetings have become a common way to communicate
with others, but your phone can still be a lifeline to getting your job done.
From building rapport when you can’t be there in person to maintaining momentum
on a project, sometimes it’s easier to just pick up the phone and talk to
someone. At the same time, we understand that many of you work remotely, have
flexible work schedules or travel frequently and can’t be tethered to your
desk or phone all day.

To better adapt to how you work, we want to ensure you have flexibility in how
you communicate including being able to make and receive phone calls from
anywhere, at any time. We're excited to announce that you'll soon be able
to use Microsoft Teams as your phone. This upgrade will provide
instant messaging, online meetings and phone calling all in one application,
simplifying the way you work.

Using Teams as your phone offers...

-   Flexibility - Make and receive calls anywhere, any time, across
    devices

-   Adaptability - Easily move between your headset and a variety of
    devices, including mobile

-   Capability - Transfer calls to an internal contact, external number or
    even your voicemail

-   Productivity - Call your contacts with one click, alleviating the need
    to remember phone numbers

IMPORTANT NOTICE: Your new phone system is live
```

Body of email:

```
Welcome to your new phone system. Your Microsoft Teams application
has been enabled with phone calling capabilities. You should now see a dial pad
tab on your client, enabling you to make outgoing calls and listen to
your voicemail. When a call comes in, you'll receive an alert, just like you
would for an instant message. Just select the alert to answer the call – it’s
that easy!

CALL TO ACTION

*  Plug in your headset, go to the Calls tab, and either
   call a contact or use the dial pad to make a call. 

*  Start a chat, and escalate it to a call.

With the launch of phone calling capabilities in Teams, we'll be
recycling your old phone, allowing for more real estate on your desk.
