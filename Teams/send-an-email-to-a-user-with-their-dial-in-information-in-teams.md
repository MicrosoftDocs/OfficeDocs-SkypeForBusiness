# Send an email to a user with their Audio Conferencing information in Microsoft Teams

Sometimes Microsoft Teams users may need you to send them their Audio Conferencing information. You can do this by clicking **Send conference info via email** under the properties for a user. When you send this email, it will contain all of the audio conferencing information, including:
  
- The conference phone or dial-in phone number for the user.

Here is an example of the email that is sent:
