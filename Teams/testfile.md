> [!TIP]
> The following is an example of a completed business use case:
>|         |
>|---------|
>|**Description of current business process**<p>Standard configuration of Contoso’s office workspaces includes a desktop phone for every desk. Each employee will be provided with a direct inward dialing (DID) phone number. The desktop phones are connected to a PBX system and connected to PSTN via session initiation protocol (SIP) trunk. Employees can only make and receive phone calls at their assigned desktop phones.|
>|**Challenges with existing business process**<p>Usage analysis of the desktop phones shows that only 10% of the desktop phones are actively used, with the rest either configured to forward calls to mobile phones, or configured to simultaneously ring to mobile phones. Maintenance of existing PBX system and the associated desktop phones contributes to 20% of monthly telephony service cost.|
>|**How technology can overcome these challenges**<p>Phone System with Calling Plans will allow end user’s personal computer to receive and place phone calls over data network by leveraging the native Microsoft Teams app, removing the necessity to roll out and maintain desktop phones, and opens the opportunity to decommission the existing PBX system, as the phone service can be delivered via the cloud over the network with no dependency on traditional phone system.|
>|**Expected, measurable, business outcomes**<p>Removing requirements to maintain and decommissioning existing legacy PBX and desktop phones, will deliver a 20% reduction of monthly telephony service expense. Phone System with Calling Plans will simplify office workspaces, allowing Contoso to expand its operations by establishing new offices with minimal upfront telephony costs.|
