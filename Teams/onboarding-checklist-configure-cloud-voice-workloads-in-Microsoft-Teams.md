| 1  | Determine whether Audio Conferencing is available for your organization’s locations | Microsoft provides Audio Conferencing across many countries and cities. See the guidance in the **Additional information** column for the latest list of countries and regions covered. <br/><br/> You can select a country or region to see which Teams voice workloads are available. | | [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md) |
| 2  | Verify your list of users and deployment cadence for enabling Audio Conferencing    | Check that you have a list of business units or sites in scope for Audio Conferencing with Teams. Using the objectives and key results model, work out which users will be in scope. We recommend that you work on a site-by-site basis so you can focus your resources.<br/><br/> As part of your enablement plan, identify which users you’ll enable, and when (Pilot, Site 1, Site 2, and so on). | | [Audio Conferencing Envisioning](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/audio-conferencing#Envision_AudioConferencing)  |
| 3  | Obtain phone numbers | Learn about the service numbers that can be used with the Teams Audio Conferencing workload.<br/><br/> Acquire new phone numbers from Microsoft, or schedule number porting for Audio Conferencing bridge numbers for the site.<br/><br/> For Audio Conferencing, you might also transfer your existing toll-free numbers or—alternatively—acquire new toll-free numbers from Microsoft.<br/><br/> To obtain service numbers, if your country or region is listed but no service numbers are available in the Skype for Business admin center, send us a new phone number request at <ptn@microsoft.com> (for the US) or <ptneu@microsoft.com> (for countries outside the US). For more information, see the “Manage phone numbers for your organization” guidance linked to in the **Additional information** column. <br/><br/>**Note:** Depending on the service provider, the number porting process can take up to 30 days. Be sure to take this into account in your planning. | | [Different kinds of phone numbers used for Calling Plans](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/different-kinds-of-phone-numbers-used-for-calling-plans) <br/><br/>[Get new user phone numbers request form](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/get-new-user-phone-numbers-request-forms) <br/><br/>[Getting phone numbers for your users](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/getting-phone-numbers-for-your-users) <br/><br/>[Transfer phone numbers to Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/transfer-phone-numbers-to-office-365) <br/><br/>[Transferring phone numbers common questions](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/transferring-phone-numbers-common-questions) <br/><br/>[Manage phone numbers for your organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization) |
| 4  | Configure your default conference bridge phone number | You can configure your organization's default conference bridge phone number, which is assigned to users who have been enabled but not explicitly assigned a conference bridge phone number. The default number should align to your organization’s central location. | | [Set the phone numbers included on invites](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/audio-conferencing-in-office-365/set-the-phone-numbers-included-on-invites) |
| 5  | Set up languages for conference bridge phone numbers | Configure the primary and secondary languages for your conference bridge phone numbers. <br/><br/>Confirm that the regional conference bridge phone numbers are assigned the appropriate languages to support your users. | | [Set auto attendant languages for Audio Conferencing](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/audio-conferencing-in-office-365/set-auto-attendant-languages-for-audio-conferencing) |
| 6  | Configure conference bridge settings | Configure the meeting join experience, PIN length, and meeting entry/exit announcement settings. Align these conference bridge settings with the goals of your organization. | | [Change the settings for an Audio Conferencing bridge](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/audio-conferencing-in-office-365/change-the-settings-for-an-audio-conferencing-bridge) |
| 7  | Customize meeting invitations | As the administrator, you can include URLs in the meeting invitation that link to Help or legal information. You can also update the logo and add footer text to the invitation. | | [Customize meeting invitations](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/set-up-skype-for-business-online/customize-meeting-invitations) |
| 8  | Configure dial plans | A dial plan lets users dial phone numbers the way they’re used to, such as omitting the area code for local calls, omitting the country code for domestic calls, or even using short-digit dialing to dial out to other users during a conference. <br/><br/>The service dial plan—the default—is based on a user’s Office 365 usage location and can’t be changed. <br/><br/>If the default service dial plan doesn’t meet your needs, you can configure tenant dial plans at the tenant or user level. | | [Dial Plans in Microsoft Teams Audio Conferencing](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/audio-conferencing#dial-plans) <br/><br/>[Office 365 Calling Plan dial plans](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/what-are-dial-plans) |
| 9  | Assign conference numbers and PINs to users | By default, conference numbers are assigned to users in accordance with the default number Teams administrator selected. Initial user PINs are randomly generated based on the PIN policy.<br/><br/> Users will receive the conference number and PINs in an email. Users can change their PINs. <br/><br/>As an administrator, you can enable dial-in users to use a conference number that’s different from the default number and local to their location. | | |
| 10 | Prepare and execute user acceptance testing | Prepare and execute user acceptance tests, including dial-in and dial-out scenarios. | | [Test Plan for Audio Conferencing](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/onboarding-test-plan-for-enterprises-audio-conferencing) |
| 11 | Report usage, health, key success indicators, and quality | Report on usage, health, KSIs, and quality as you defined them during the Envision phase. | | [Operations Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/1-drive-value-operate-my-service) |

| 3  | Obtain phone numbers | Learn about the subscriber numbers that you can use with the Teams Calling Plans. <br/><br/>Acquire new phone numbers from Microsoft, or schedule number porting for user phone numbers. <br/><br/>If you are going to acquire new subscriber numbers from Microsoft, decide whether you’ll request geographic or non-geographic numbers. <br/><br/>**Note:** Depending on the service provider, the number porting process can take up to 30 days. Be sure to take this into account in your planning. | | [Different kinds of phone numbers used for Calling Plans](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/different-kinds-of-phone-numbers-used-for-calling-plans) <br/><br/>[Get new user phone numbers request form](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/get-new-user-phone-numbers-request-forms) <br/><br/>[Getting phone numbers for your users](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/getting-phone-numbers-for-your-users) <br/><br/>[Transfer phone numbers to Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/transfer-phone-numbers-to-office-365) <br/><br/>[Transferring phone numbers common questions](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/transferring-phone-numbers-common-questions) <br/><br/>[Manage phone numbers for your organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization) |

| 5  | Configure emergency locations | To assign a number to a voice user, you must also assign them an emergency location for E.911 purposes. <br/><br/>We recommend using PowerShell to automate the creation of Location services.| | [Emergency locations, addresses, and call routing](what-are-emergency-locations-addresses-and-call-routing.md) |
| 6  | Assign licenses, phone numbers, tenant-user dial plan, and emergency locations to users | Assign E5 licenses to your users. If you use E3/E4 SKUs, then assign Phone System add-on to end users. <br/><br/>After you assign licenses, continue by assigning phone numbers, dial plans, and emergency locations. Use user enablement scripts to easily configure multiple users at once. | | [MyAdvisor – User enablement scripts](https://myadvisor.fasttrack.microsoft.com/CloudVoice/Downloads?SelectedIDs=5_2_0_6,5_2_0_3)|
| 7  | Configure Azure Voicemail | If the mailboxes of your users are hosted on Exchange Online, their voice mailboxes will be provisioned automatically. <br/><br/>However, for an on-premises deployment of Exchange Server, you’ll need to make sure you have the supported version and topology. Follow the steps in the **Additional information** column. You can turn voicemail transcription on or off for your organization.| | [Azure PBX voicemail support for Exchange Server](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3195158/customer-issues-between-exum-and-azure-voicemail) <br/><br/>[Set up Cloud Voicemail](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-is-phone-system-in-office-365/phone-system-voicemail/set-up-phone-system-voicemail) |
| 8  | OPTIONAL: Configure caller ID for incoming and outgoing calls | By default, all outbound calls use the assigned phone number for calling identity (Caller ID). <br/><br/>You can optionally change or block the caller ID for a user. <br/><br/>**Note:** Emergency calls always send the user's telephone number as the caller ID. | | [How can caller ID be used in your organization?](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/how-can-caller-id-be-used-in-your-organization.md) <br/><br/>[Set the Caller ID for a user](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/set-the-caller-id-for-a-user)|
| 9  | OPTIONAL: Configure interoperability with Skype for Business | Configure interoperability policies if your organization migrates from Skype for Business to Teams. <br/><br/>Interoperability enables Skype for Business and Teams users to chat and call one another. <br/><br/>Your existing deployment and your intended rollout strategy for Teams will affect your plans. Review interoperability options, requirements, and limitations, and configure policies accordingly. <br/><br/>**Note:** These steps only apply if your organization still hosts users on Skype for Business Online. | | [Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business interoperability](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-and-skypeforbusiness-coexistence-and-interoperability) <br/><br/>[Quick start guide: Configuring Calling Plans in Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/configuring-teams-calling-quickstartguide) |
