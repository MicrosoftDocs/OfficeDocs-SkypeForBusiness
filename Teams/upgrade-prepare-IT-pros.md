# Prepare your IT staff for Microsoft Teams

Your Office 365 tenant admins, technical leads, and support desk are accountable for driving a high-quality user experience. This includes ensuring that your network is ready to support Teams, configuring Teams for your users, and being able to effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues that might arise.

Share the following resources with your IT staff members, and confirm that they’re ready to support users before you begin your upgrade to Teams:

-   [Admin training for Microsoft Teams](itadmin-readiness.md)
 
-   [Support resources for Microsoft Teams](support-resources.md)
 
-   [Troubleshoot connectivity issues with the Microsoft Teams client](connectivity-issues.md)
 
-   [Use log files in troubleshooting Microsoft Teams](log-files.md)
