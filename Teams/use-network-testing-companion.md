Use the Network Testing Companion
=================================

The Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams [Network Testing Companion](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/NetworkTestingCompanion/1.5.4) gives you an easy way to test your network quality and your connection to Skype for Business Online or Microsoft Teams. You can easily interpret the results and share them with network administrators to gain insights into potential network issues.

You can use this tool in the planning phase of a Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams deployment. If you're currently using Teams or Skype for Business Online, you can use this tool to troubleshoot voice quality issues or simply to check your network connection before you make a call or after youâ€™ve had a poor-quality experience.
