Admin settings for apps in Microsoft Teams
==========================================
> [!IMPORTANT]
> [!INCLUDE [new-teams-sfb-admin-center-notice](includes/new-teams-sfb-admin-center-notice.md)]

Apps provide out-of-the-box tools for your organization to get more out of Teams. These apps combine the functionality of tabs, messaging extensions, connectors, and bots provided by Microsoft, built by a third-party, or by developers in your organization.

In **Teams apps** in the Microsoft Teams admin center, you can set policies to manage apps for your organization. For example, you can set policies to customize Teams by pinning the apps that are most important for your users.

We're continually improving the app experience in Teams and adding features and functionality. Over time, we'll be building additional app management capabilities, so check back for the most up-to-date information on app policies.

## App setup policies

App setup policies let you customize the app experience for your users. You choose the apps that you want to pin to the app bar in the Teams clients and the order in which they appear, on web, desktop, and mobile clients.

Here's some examples of how you can use app setup policies:
- Drive awareness and adoption of core apps. For example, pin a custom recruiting and talent management app for users on your HR team.
- Selectively pin core Teams features, such as Chat, Teams, and Calling. Doing so can help ensure users are engaged in specific activities within Teams.
