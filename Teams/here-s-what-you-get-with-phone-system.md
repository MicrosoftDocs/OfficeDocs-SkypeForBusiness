# Here's what you get with Phone System in Office 365

A PBX is a phone system within a business. The Phone System in Office 365 add-on gives you PBX capabilities, but without the complicated and expensive equipment. 
  
With the Phone System add-on, you can use Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams to complete basic tasks such as making and receiving calls, transferring calls, and muting or unmuting calls from nearly anywhere with Internet access. It's available worldwide! 
  
For more information, see [Pricing for Phone System](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/voice-calling#requirements).

|Skype and federated calling  <br/> |You can search for anyone in the Skype directory, then securely connect, communicate, and collaborate with them.  <br/> |
|[Set Call Forwarding options in Skype for Business](https://support.office.com/article/1ec2e7fb-471c-4c35-bc90-a35991b3f532) <br/> |Sends your calls to your team either immediately or after a set time period.  <br/> |

|[Check you voicemail in Microsoft Teams](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/check-your-voicemail-in-teams-f8d568ce-7329-4fe2-a6a2-325ec2e2b419) <br/> |Here's how Cloud Voicemail works: When a user receives a voicemail, it is delivered to their mailbox as an email with the voicemail message as an attachment. They can also listen to their messages over their Skype certified desktop phone, all Skype for Business applications, or Lync for Mac 2011.  <br/> Cloud Voicemail includes personalized greeting, message waiting indicator, and reply with call. You can have all of your voicemail deposited in mailboxes and made available through Skype for Business on your PC, mobile device, and IP phone.  <br/> |
|Music on hold | Available in September 2019, Phone System will play default music defined by the service when an external call from the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) is placed on hold.  This feature works for one-to-one PSTN-to-Teams calls in addition to calls made to a call queue. This feature provides on-hold notification parity with other platforms. (All other platforms give a visual cue when a user is put on hold, but the PSTN caller has had no way of knowing.)  On first release, this feature is not configurable by the administrator. Hold music is also not supported in consultative transfer of a PSTN call.| 
|Reverse Number Lookup | Available in September, 2019, Phone System will show called ID for an external phone number if the number is associated with a user in AAD. If the phone number is not in AAD, the telco provided display name will be shown if it is available.  |
