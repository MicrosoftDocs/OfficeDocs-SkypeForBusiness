# Assign, change, or remove a phone number for a user

When you set up Calling Plans, you assign phone numbers to your users. In Microsoft Teams, the phone number you assign is listed when a user clicks **Calls**.

When you're setting up users so they can make and receive phone calls, you must first use the Microsoft Teams admin center and assign a phone number. You can change or remove the phone number if you need to.
  
To learn how to get Calling Plans in Teams and how much they cost, see [Teams add-on licensing](teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md).
  
> [!NOTE]
> One way to see whether a user has a license assigned is by going to the Microsoft Teams admin center > **Users**. If a license is assigned, it will be indicated on the page.  You can also use the Office 365 admin center.
  
 ## Assign a phone number to a user

1. In the left navigation, click **Voice** > **Phone numbers**.
   > [!NOTE]
   > For you to see the **Voice** option in the left navigation in the Microsoft Teams admin center, you must first buy at least one **Enterprise E5 license**, one **Phone System** add-on license, or one **Audio Conferencing** add-on license. 
2. On the **Phone numbers** page, select an unassigned number in the list, and then click **Edit**.  
3. In the **Edit** pane, under **Assigned to**, search for the user by display name or user name, and then click **Assign**.
4. To assign or change the associated emergency location, under **Emergency location**, search for and then select the location.
6. Click **Save**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > Because of the latency between Office 365 and Teams, it can possibly take up to 24 hours for users to be enabled. If after 24 hours, if the phone number isn't assigned correctly, please [Contact support for business products - Admin Help](https://support.office.com/article/32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b).
