# Get started on your upgrade from Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams

Congratulations on your pending upgrade from Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams. Whether you’re just getting started with Teams, already using Teams alongside Skype for Business, or ready to upgrade, we want to ensure you have everything you need to navigate a successful journey to Teams.

Whether you are upgrading from Skype for Business Online to Teams or from a Skype for Business on-premises environment to Teams, the upgrade framework will guide you through the process based on your business scenario. We also encourage you to visit the [Upgrade hub](upgrade-skype-teams.yml) for additional training and resources for implementing a successful upgrade from Skype for Business to Teams.

Keep reading for frequently-asked questions about upgrade.

## Why upgrade to Microsoft Teams?

Microsoft Teams extends the capabilities of Skype for Business, bringing together chat, meetings, calling, collaboration, app integration, and file storage into a single interface. Teams helps streamline the way users get things done, improving user satisfaction and accelerating business outcomes. We’re continually expanding Teams’ capabilities to enable you to communicate and collaborate in new ways, break down organizational and geographical barriers, and drive efficiency in process and decision making. Learn more about the benefits of upgrading to Teams in the Forrester report: [Total Economic Impact of Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Total-Economic-Impact-Microsoft-Teams-Infographic.pdf).  

## When should my organization migrate to Teams?

While the Skype for Business Online service will be fully functional through July 31, 2021, we strongly recommend that you begin your upgrade to Teams today. By starting your upgrade today, you'll have ample time to finish it prior to the retirement date. You can choose to upgrade to Teams using either the overlapping capabilities method (“Islands mode”) or the select capabilities method. For more information about these methods, see [Choose your upgrade journey from Skype for Business to Teams](upgrade-and-coexistence-of-skypeforbusiness-and-teams.md).

## Can we continue to use Skype for Business Online as we prepare for and execute our upgrade to Teams?

Yes, Microsoft offers several options for running Skype for Business Online and Teams together. These coexistence modes allow your users to become familiar with Teams today while helping accelerate your upgrade to Teams Only. For more information, see [https://aka.ms/SkypeToTeams-Coexist](./teams-and-skypeforbusiness-coexistence-and-interoperability.md).

## Is Phone System available for Teams users?

Yes. Phone System is available to all Teams users after they are moved to TeamsOnly mode.  In addition, Microsoft provides options for connecting to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) so that users can make phone calls anywhere in the world. For more information, see [Voice - Phone System and PSTN connectivity](cloud-voice-landing-page.md).

## Can we continue to use our on-premises telephony infrastructure?

Yes. With Phone System Direct Routing, you can use Phone System with virtually any telephony carrier. With Direct Routing, you connect your own Session Border Controller (SBC) directly to Phone System. For more information, see [Phone System Direct Routing](direct-routing-landing-page.md).

## How is Microsoft helping customers with their migration to Teams?

Microsoft is committed to helping make your transition from Skype for Business to Teams a success. Microsoft is providing robust guidance built around a proven, end-to-end upgrade success framework designed to help you plan and execute the upgrade to Teams. Our guidance is designed for every stage of the upgrade journey, whether you are just getting started with planning, already running Teams alongside Skype for Business, or ready to upgrade to Teams.

To help facilitate your upgrade planning and implementation, Microsoft hosts complimentary live, interactive upgrade planning workshops, designed to help you get familiar with our upgrade framework, share insights into preparing your users for the upgrade, and identify the right path for your organization on your journey to Teams. Join us for an upgrade planning overview session: [https://aka.ms/SkypeToTeamsPlanning](./upgrade-workshops-landing-page.yml).

Organizations using Skype for Business Online may be eligible for Microsoft-assisted upgrades to Teams to help make the successful transition from Skype for Business Online prior to the July 31, 2021 retirement of the service. Assisted upgrades reduce the number of technical tasks required of customers and allows for greater focus on organizational preparedness, user awareness, and Teams training.

Customers scheduled for assisted upgrades will receive notifications in both the Teams admin center as well as the Microsoft 365 Message Center three months before their upgrade date. For more information, see [Assisted upgrades from Skype for Business Online to Microsoft Teams](upgrade-assisted.md).

## Why do I need upgrade guidance? Can’t I just delete/decommission Skype for Business?

Upgrading from Skype for Business to Teams is more than a technical migration. It represents a transformation in how users communicate and collaborate, and change is not always easy. The ideal upgrade approach should address the technical aspects of your upgrade as well as encourage user acceptance and adoption of Teams, driving a positive user experience and business outcome realization.

## Where do I start planning for Teams/my upgrade to Teams?

Start your journey by familiarizing yourself with our upgrade success framework and associated resources. This guidance serves as the cornerstone for navigating your journey from Skype for Business to Teams.
