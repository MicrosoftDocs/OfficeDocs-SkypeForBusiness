# Getting started with your Microsoft Teams upgrade

## Why upgrade to Microsoft Teams?

Microsoft Teams extends the capabilities of Skype for Business, bringing together chat, meetings, calling, collaboration, app integration, and file storage into a single interface. This new central hub for teamwork can help streamline the way users get things done, improving user satisfaction and accelerating business outcomes. As an existing Skype for Business customer, we invite you to upgrade to Microsoft Teams to experience this full suite of communication and collaboration capabilities in a single client experience.

## When should my organization upgrade to Teams?

Microsoft encourages customers to upgrade to Teams as quickly as feasible to optimize benefit realization. If your organization is not quite ready to upgrade, you can deploy Teams alongside Skype for Business. This lets users become familiar with Teams today while facilitating your upgrade over time. In fact, many of our customers are seeing users organically shift their communication activities to Teams.
 
## How is Microsoft helping customers with their upgrade to Teams? 

Microsoft is committed to your success and is providing robust guidance built around a proven, end-to-end upgrade success framework designed to help you plan and execute the upgrade to Teams. Our guidance is designed for every stage of the upgrade journey, whether you are just getting started with planning, already running Teams alongside Skype for Business, or ready to upgrade to Teams.

To help facilitate your upgrade planning and implementation, Microsoft is hosting complimentary online training, designed to quickly familiarize yourself with our upgrade framework, share insights into preparing your users for the upgrade and orient you to the various coexistence options your organization can take on your journey to Teams. Join us for an upgrade planning overview session: [https://aka.ms/Upgrade101](https://aka.ms/upgrade101).
 
## Why do I need upgrade guidance? Can’t I just delete/decommission Skype for Business? 

Upgrading from Skype for Business to Teams is more than a technical migration. It represents a transformation in how users communicate and collaborate, and change is not always easy. The ideal upgrade approach should address the technical aspects of your upgrade as well as encourage user acceptance and adoption of Teams, driving a positive user experience and business outcome realization. 

## Where do I start planning for Teams/my upgrade to Teams? 

Start your journey by familiarizing yourself with our upgrade success framework and associated resources. This guidance serves as the cornerstone for navigating your journey from Skype for Business to Teams.
