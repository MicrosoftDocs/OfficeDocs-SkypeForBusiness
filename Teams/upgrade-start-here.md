# Getting started with your Microsoft Teams upgrade

Congratulations on your pending upgrade from Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams. Whether you’re just getting started with Teams, already using Teams alongside Skype for Business, or ready to upgrade, we want to ensure you have everything you need to navigate a successful journey to Teams.

## Why upgrade to Microsoft Teams?

Microsoft Teams extends the capabilities of Skype for Business, bringing together chat, meetings, calling, collaboration, app integration, and file storage into a single interface. This new central hub for teamwork can help streamline the way users get things done, improving user satisfaction and accelerating business outcomes. We’re continually expanding Teams’ capabilities to enable you to communicate and collaborate in new ways, break down organizational and geographical barriers, and drive efficiency in process and decision making. Learn more about the benefits of upgrading to Teams in the Forrester report: [Total Economic Impact of Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Total-Economic-Impact-Microsoft-Teams-Infographic.pdf).  

## When should my organization upgrade to Teams?

Skype for Business Online will be retired on July 31, 2021, after which it will no longer be accessible or supported. While the Skype for Business Online service will be fully functional through July 31, 2021, Microsoft encourages customers to begin their upgrade journey today, allowing ample time to complete their upgrade prior to the retirement date.  Read our retirement announcement to learn more.

## Can we continue to use Skype for Business Online as we prepare for and execute our upgrade to Teams?

Yes, Microsoft offers several options for running Skype for Business Online and Teams together. These coexistence modes allow your users to become familiar with Teams today while helping accelerate your upgrade to Teams Only. For more information, see [https://aka.ms/SkypeToTeams-Coexist](https://aka.ms/SkypeToTeams-Coexist).
 
## How is Microsoft helping customers with their upgrade to Teams?

Microsoft is providing robust guidance built around a proven, end-to-end upgrade success framework designed to help you plan and execute the upgrade to Teams. Our guidance is designed for every stage of the upgrade journey, whether you are just getting started with planning, already running Teams alongside Skype for Business, or ready to upgrade to Teams.

To help facilitate your upgrade planning and implementation, Microsoft is hosting complimentary live, interactive upgrade planning workshops, designed to familiarize yourself with our upgrade framework, share insights into preparing your users for the upgrade, and identify the right path for your organization on your journey to Teams.

## Why do I need upgrade guidance? Can’t I just delete/decommission Skype for Business? 

Upgrading from Skype for Business to Teams is more than a technical migration. It represents a transformation in how users communicate and collaborate, and change is not always easy. The ideal upgrade approach should address the technical aspects of your upgrade as well as encourage user acceptance and adoption of Teams, driving a positive user experience and business outcome realization. 

## Where do I start planning for Teams/my upgrade to Teams?
