# Assign team owners and members in Microsoft Teams admin center

**Owner** and **member** are the two user roles within Microsoft Teams. The user who creates a new team is granted owner status by default. Owners and members have different types of permissions and capabilities when interacting with a team and its channels. See [Overview of teams and channels in Microsoft Teams](teams-channels-overview.md) to learn more about roles in Teams.

> [!NOTE]
> If a team is created from an existing Microsoft 365 group, permissions are inherited.

## Assign a user role in Teams admin center

1. In the Teams admin center, expand **Teams** and select **Manage teams**.
2. Select the team name under the display name column.
3. In the Members tab, you can add or remove members and assign owner and moderator roles to members.

## Restrict permission to create teams

All users with a mailbox in Exchange Online have permissions to create Microsoft 365 groups and a team within Microsoft Teams. Restrict users from creating new teams and Microsoft 365 groups by delegating group creation and management rights to a set of users. If this restriction is active, neither team owners or members can create new teams. For more information, see [Manage who can create Microsoft 365 Groups](https://support.office.com/article/manage-who-can-create-office-365-groups-4c46c8cb-17d0-44b5-9776-005fced8e618).
