# Search for phone numbers for users

When you are setting up users in your organization to make and receive phone calls, you must use the **Microsoft Teams admin center** and first get phone numbers that can be assigned to users. The phone number you assign to a user will be a phone number that you have chosen for your organization and will be listed in the drop-down list when you edit the properties of the user and click **Assign**.
  
Before you can assign phone numbers to your users, you must use the **Get new numbers** page to search for numbers that are available for you within an area. You can search by **Country or region**, **Number type**, and **Location**, and then enter the number of phone numbers you will need for your users.â€¯
  
If you need some help with getting phone numbers, you can see [Manage phone numbers for your organization](/microsoftteams/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization) or [Contact support for business products - Admin Help](https://support.office.com/article/32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b)
  
## Search for phone numbers

**To search for phone numbers for your users**

![An icon showing the Teams logo](media/teams-logo-30x30.png) **Using the Microsoft Teams admin center**
  
1. Go to the **Microsoft Teams admin center**.

2. In the left navigation select **Voice** > **Phone numbers** > **Get new numbers**.
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For you to see the **Voice** option in the left navigation in the Microsoft Teams admin center, you must first buy at least one **Enterprise E5 license**, one **Phone System** add-on license, or one **Audio Conferencing** add-on license.  

3. On the **Select location and quantity** page, select a location from the **Country or region** drop-down list.

4. Select a number type from the **Number type** drop-down list.

5. In the **Location** box, type the name of the city where the user is located, and then select the location from the list. Click **Add a location** if the location you want doesn't appear on the list.

6. Select the area code for the location.

7. Under **Quantity**, enter the number of phone numbers that you want for your organization, and then click **Next**. You have 10 minutes to select your phone numbers. If you take more than 10 minutes, the numbers will be returned to the pool of phone numbers.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can see the number of phone numbers available to you (which is based on the number of licenses), listed next to **Quantity**. 
  
8. On the **Get numbers** page, select the phone numbers you want, click **Acquire numbers**, and then click **Next**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You can acquire more phone numbers than you have licenses. To determine how many phone numbers you can acquire, take your number of licenses, add 10 percent of the number of licenses, and then add 10. For example, if you have 100 **Domestic Calling Plan** and/or **International Calling Plan** licenses, you can reserve 120 phone numbers, assuming that you have not already acquired some phone numbers for those 100 users. For more details, see [How many phone numbers can you get?](./how-many-phone-numbers-can-you-get.md)

9. On the **Confirmation** page, verify your choices, and then click **Place order**.

10. When you return to the **Phone numbers** page, select the phone number or numbers that you want to assign and then click **Edit** to assign it to a user.
