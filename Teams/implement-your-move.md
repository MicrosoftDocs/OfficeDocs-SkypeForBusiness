# Implement your move to Microsoft Teams

This article provides your guidance on deployment and implementation of Microsoft Teams for the following scenarios:

1. For organizations **already using Microsoft Teams**
2. For organizations **not yet using Microsoft Teams**

## Deploying and implementing Microsoft Teams for organizations already using Microsoft Teams
 
Before proceeding, confirm that you've completed the following activities: 

- Envisioned teamwork for your organization  
- Identified champions and critical stakeholders 
- Defined your project scope  
- Piloted Microsoft Teams 
- Prepared your organization 

Follow the guidance in this article, if you **already have Microsoft Teams rolled out** and want to move your licensed users from Kaizala to Microsoft Teams. 
   
We recommend the following framework for transition:  
   
**Plan for your transition** 
   
1. First, move your chat groups to Microsoft Teams.
1. Next, use apps in Teams to replace Kaizala action cards.
1. To ensure that frontline workers are equipped, upgrade to Teams Frontline Worker functionality. For a quick start guide on Teams Frontline Worker, see [Frontline Worker Quick Start Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/flw-quickstart).
1. Consider Onboarding suppliers and partners to invite as guests in Teams.  
  
**Manage change**  
   
1. Create a communication campaign to raise awareness on the transition project. 
1. Notify your organization of the change and identify champions to drive adoption of Microsoft Teams. 
1. Empower your users to learn more about Microsoft Teams through free training. 
   
To learn more, see [Microsoft Teams video training](https://support.microsoft.com/office/microsoft-teams-video-training-4f108e54-240b-4351-8084-b1089f0d21d7?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us).   
 
## Deploying and implementing Microsoft Teams for organizations not yet using Microsoft Teams
 
Follow the guidance in this section, if you're using Kaizala and want to move your users from Kaizala to Microsoft Teams.
   
**Before proceeding, confirm that you've completed the following activities**: 
   
- Envisioned teamwork for your organization 
- Identified champions and critical stakeholders 
- Defined your project scope  
- Piloted Microsoft Teams
- Prepared your organization  
   
We recommend the following framework for transition: 
   
- **Envision teamwork for your organization** 
   
   List the current scenarios in which Kaizala is used. Next, envision scenarios above and beyond with Microsoft Teams.  

- **Pilot Teams**

   Roll out Teams to a Pilot group of users with a prioritized scenario set. 

- **Deploy Teams** 

   Learn from the pilot group. Prepare to roll out to the complete organization.  

- **Use Kaizala and Teams**  

   To find the right Microsoft Teams for your business, see [Compare Microsoft Teams Online Options | Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/compare-microsoft-teams-options). 

- **Manage change** 

   Prepare your organization for change through end-user training to drive adoption. IT Admins and Champions can drive efforts to influence positive change management on the move.  

- **Plan for your adoption of Teams**

    Prepare to move custom solutions from Kaizala to Teams, for example, Custom Action cards. 
     
- **Move your organization to Teams** 

    Empower your organization with a streamlined tool for communication from CEO to the frontline!
