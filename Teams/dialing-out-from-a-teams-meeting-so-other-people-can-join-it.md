# Dialing out from a Microsoft Teams meeting so other people can join it

As the meeting organizer, you can dial out using the Teams app to let other people join the same meeting using their phones.

When you dial out to someone, we recommend that you do so using their full phone numbers (including the country/region code - E.164 format).
  
Keep these points in mind:

- You can dial out only if you join a meeting using Teams.
- The meeting organizer either has audio conferencing enabled or uses online calling plans or direct routing to make calls to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).
- The meeting organizer is [Granted an online dial out policy that enables dial out from conferencing enabled](/powershell/module/teams/grant-csdialoutpolicy).

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [updating-admin-interfaces](includes/updating-admin-interfaces.md)]

Here's how to get dial out to work:

 **Step 1:** In the meeting, use the **Add people** ![Screenshot of the Add people button.](media/add-people-button.png) option to dial out to a phone number.
 **Step 2:** Enter the full phone number, including the country/region code in the **Invite someone or dial a number** box.
