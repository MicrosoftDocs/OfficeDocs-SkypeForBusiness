# Use Teams meeting templates, sensitivity labels, and admin policies together for sensitive meetings

[!INCLUDE[Teams Premium ECM](includes/teams-premium-ecm.md)]

In Teams meetings, meeting organizers can configure [a variety of settings](https://support.microsoft.com/office/53261366-dbd5-45f9-aae9-a70e6354f88e) that determine which features are available in the meeting. As an administrator, you can disable or enforce specific values for these settings by using a combination of admin policies, sensitivity labels, and meeting templates.

[Meeting templates](custom-meeting-templates-overview.md) are created and managed in the Teams admin center. Sensitivity labels are created and manged in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. 

> [!Note]
> Meeting settings in sensitivity labels and custom meeting templates require Teams Premium.

By using admin policies, templates, and labels together you can make possible a variety of meeting scenarios to help meet the compliance and business needs for the different departments in your organization.

## Policies, labels, templates, and meetings settings

The following table shows a list of Teams features that may be useful for managing meetings with different compliance needs in your organization and where they can be configured.

## Admin policies' effect on sensitivity labels and meeting templates

While some admin policies - such as lobby settings and who can present - specify defaults that the meeting organizer can change, most admin policies determine if a given feature is available to users at all.

If a feature is not available to a given user because the admin policy has turned it off for them, that feature can't be enforced by a sensitivity label or meeting template.

For example, if you create a *highly sensitive* label and configure it to enforce watermarking and end-to-end encryption, that enforcement will only take place if watermarking and end-to-end encryption are enabled for the meeting organizer in the admin policy.

As you plan for your meeting templates and sensitivity labels, ensure that the settings that you want to control with them are enabled in admin policies where required.

## Sensitivity labels and templates together

Some settings are only available in sensitivity labels and some are only available in templates. Several are available in both:

- Chat
- End-to-end encryption
- Lobby settings
- Meeting recording
- Watermarking

Whenever a sensitivity label is used, the settings configured in the label take precedence over any template or meeting organizer settings.

The settings in a sensitivity label can be left uncontrolled when the label is created, allowing a template or the meeting organizer to control these settings.

Sensitivity labels are often used for multiple purposes - labeling documents, sites, and emails, as well as meetings. You can avoid creating additional labels that are just for meetings by using templates along with the labels to account for variations within a particular type of meeting.

For example your marketing department might have different requirements for sensitive meetings than the research department. You can configure the settings that are common to both in a sensitivity label and then make separate templates available to the two groups which further refine the meeting settings for that group. Both templates could use the same label.

## User-based policies and meeting-based policies

Teams policies - including meeting policies - apply at the user or group level. Sensitivity label and template settings apply at the individual meeting level where those labels and templates are used. Consider where it makes sense to configure settings in Teams admin policies versus sensitivity labels or templates.

Here are a few examples:

If you want different default lobby settings for the research department and the marketing department, you can configure these defaults using admin policies and further modify them with labels or templates.

If you want watermarks available only for governance officials, you can enable them only for those people using an admin policy. You can then have labels or templates that enforce watermarking, but the watermarking will only be used in meetings organized by governance officials.

## Different meeting types with the same sensitivity

Using templates and labels together can be useful if you have different types of meetings that have the same sensitivity. For example, if some of your sensitive meetings are interactive and some are presentations where there is minimal interaction from attendees, you can create two templates:
- One that turns off attendee video and audio to use for presentations
- One that leaves video and audio at the discretion of the meeting organizer to use for interactive meetings

Both templates could use the *Sensitive* label which would control additional settings such as who can bypass the lobby and who can present.

## Specify default values that meeting organizers can change

While labels generally enforce a particular setting, templates can either enforce a setting or allow the meeting organizer to change it. This allows you to implement default settings that meet your compliance needs while giving meeting organizers the option to override the setting if appropriate.

For example, for a baseline level of protection, you might want to use a sensitivity label to turn off watermarking. At the same time, you can use a template to set the default for who can bypass the lobby, but allow the meeting organizer to change the setting if they need to.

You can assign your baseline protection label to the template so that both are used when a meeting organizer chooses that template.

Some admin policies can also be used to set a default value that can be changed by a meeting organizer. These include lobby controls and who can present.
