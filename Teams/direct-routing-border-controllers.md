# List of Session Border Controllers certified for Direct Routing

Microsoft partners with selected Session Border Controllers (SBC) vendors to certify that their SBCs work with Direct Routing. 

Microsoft works with each vendor to: 

- Jointly work on the SIP interconnection protocols.
- Perform intense tests using a third-party lab. Only devices that pass the tests are certified. 
- Run daily tests with all certified devices in production and pre-production environments. Validating the devices in pre-production environments guarantees that new versions of Direct Routing code in the cloud will work with certified SBCs. 
- Establish a joint support process with the SBC vendors.


  > [!NOTE]
  > Microsoft only supports Phone System if a certified device or devices are connected through Direct Routing. Microsoft reserves the right to reject support cases where a non-certified device is connected to the Phone System through Direct Routing. 

The table below lists devices certified for Direct Routing. (For information about which SBC vendors support Local Media Optimization, see [Configure Local Media Optimization for Direct Routing](direct-routing-media-optimization-configure.md).)
