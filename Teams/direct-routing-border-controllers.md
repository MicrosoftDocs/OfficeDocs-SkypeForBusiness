# Session Border Controllers certified for Direct Routing

Microsoft partners with selected Session Border Controllers (SBC) vendors to certify that their SBCs work with Direct Routing.

Microsoft works with each vendor to:

- Jointly work on the SIP interconnection protocols.
- Perform intense tests using a third-party lab. Only devices that pass the tests are certified.
- Run daily tests with all certified devices in production and pre-production environments. Validating the devices in pre-production environments guarantees that new versions of Direct Routing code in the cloud will work with certified SBCs.
- Establish a joint support process with the SBC vendors.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Microsoft only supports Phone System if a certified device or devices are connected through Direct Routing. In case of issues, customer must contact SBC vendors customer support first. If needed, SBC vendor will escalate the issue to Microsoft via internal channels. Microsoft reserves the right to reject support cases where a non-certified device is connected to the Phone System through Direct Routing. If Microsoft determines that a customer’s Direct Routing issue is with a vendor’s SBC device, the customer will need to re-engage the SBC vendor for support.
  >
  > The certification is granted to specific SBC firmware versions. Any SBC firmware version documented below is both certified and supported. Firmware versions that are higher than what is documented are supported as long as the major.minor version is the same.
  >
  > Example:
  >
  > - Supported 6.10.258 - in this case, we also support firmware versions 6.10.(258 or higher).
  > - Recommended 6.20.100 - in this case, we also recommend firmware versions 6.20.(100 or higher).
  > - For supportability questions about specific version, reach out to your SBC vendor.

The tables that follow list devices certified for Direct Routing. (For information about which SBC vendors support Local Media Optimization, see [Configure Local Media Optimization for Direct Routing](direct-routing-media-optimization-configure.md).)
