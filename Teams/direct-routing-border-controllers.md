# List of Session Border Controllers certified for Direct Routing

Microsoft partners with selected Session Border Controllers (SBC) vendors to certify that their SBCs for work with Direct Routing. 

With each vendor, Microsoft: 

- Jointly works with the SBC vendors on the SIP interconnection protocols.
- Performs intense tests via a third-party lab; only devices that passed the tests are certified. 
- Runs daily tests with all certified devices in production and pre-production environments. Validating the devices in pre-production environments guarantees that new versions of Direct Routing code in the cloud will work with certified SBCs. 
- Has a joint support process with the SBC vendors.


  > [!NOTE]
  > Microsoft only supports Phone System if a certified device or devices are connected via Direct Routing. Microsoft reserves the right to reject support cases where a non-certified device is connected to the Phone System via Direct Routing. 

The table below lists devices certified for Direct Routing.
