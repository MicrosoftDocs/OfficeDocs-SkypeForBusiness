# Assign Microsoft Teams licenses

You can assign licenses to your users for features like Audio Conferencing, Phone System, and Calling Plans. This article explains how to add these licenses in bulk and for an individual user. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> See [Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md) for information about what licenses you need to buy and how to buy them, depending on your Office 365 plan, so users get Audio Conferencing, toll-free numbers, and the ability to call phone numbers outside your business.

## Phone System and Calling Plans: Tips and scripts for assigning licenses

Hereâ€™s what you need to know before assigning Audio Conferencing, Phone System, and Calling Plan licenses.

- **Using on-premises PSTN connectivity for hybrid users?** If so, you only need to assign a Phone System license. You should NOT assign a Calling Plan.

- **Latency after assigning licenses**: Because of the latency between Office 365 and Microsoft Teams, it can take up to 24 hours for a user to be assigned a Calling Plan after you assign a license. If after 24 hours the user isn't assigned a Calling Plan, please [contact support for business products - admin help](https://support.office.com/article/32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b).

- **Error messages**: You will get an error message if you haven't purchased the correct number of licenses. If you need to buy more Calling Plan licenses, choose **Buy more**.

- **Next steps**: After you assign Calling Plan licenses to your users, you will need to get your phone numbers for your organization, and then assign those numbers to the people in your organization. For step-by-step instructions, see [Set up Calling Plans](set-up-calling-plans.md).

## Assign a Phone System and Calling Plan license to one user

The steps are the same as assigning an Office 365 license. See [Assign or remove licenses for Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/article/997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc).

1. Install the Microsoft Online Services Sign-In Assistant for IT Professionals RTW. Don't have the module installed? See [Microsoft Online Services Sign-In Assistant for IT Professionals RTW](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=625123) to download it.

2. Install the Windows Azure Active Directory Module. Don't have the module installed? See [Manage Azure AD using Windows PowerShell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=320628) for download instructions and cmdlet syntax.

## Audio Conferencing: tips and scripts for assigning licenses

Here's what you need to know before assigning Audio Conferencing licenses.

- **Third-party audio conferencing provider**: If someone is already set up to use a third-party audio conferencing provider, when you assign them an Audio Conferencing license, they will be changed to use Microsoft as the audio conferencing provider. You can change them back to the third-party provider.

- **Next steps**: After you assign Audio Conferencing licenses, you need to assign an audio conferencing provider. See [Assign Microsoft as the audio conferencing provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/skypeforbusiness/audio-conferencing-in-office-365/assign-microsoft-as-the-audio-conferencing-provider).
