    In this training, we introduce Audio Conferencing in Microsoft Teams—the ability
    to join a Teams meeting from a regular phone and dial out from a meeting to a
    phone number. We’ll cover the capabilities of Audio Conferencing in Teams in
    addition to requirements and planning considerations for Teams.

    [!INCLUDE [tutorial-disclaimer-note](includes/tutorial-disclaimer-note.md)]

    This training is for you if you’re:
    -   An IT pro.
    -   Responsible for planning, deploying, or managing Teams.

    With Audio Conferencing, participants use a regular phone to take part in Teams
    meetings—either by dialing in to the meeting from their phone or by using
    dial-out functionality from within the meeting. Review the following resources
    to learn more about Audio Conferencing:

- title: Scenario – Audio Conferencing
  durationInMinutes: 1
  content: |

    Garth works at Contoso, a company that has multiple offices. Garth frequently
    needs to connect with people in other office locations, and because he often
    works from home or goes out on the road, he’s a huge fan of Teams meetings. When
    Garth sends out a meeting invitation, it automatically adds information for
    Audio Conferencing. This makes the following scenarios possible:
    -   Alice wants to attend Garth’s meeting but she’s on the road and has no
        access to a reliable network. Therefore, she joins the meeting by using the
        dial-in coordinates from the meeting invitation. During the dial-in process,
        she uses her PIN to authenticate, so she’s recognized by the system as
        “Alice.”
    -   Bob, who’s currently at a hotel, joins the meeting by using the Teams client
        on his PC. Unfortunately, the audio quality over the internet connection in
        the hotel isn’t great, So Bob dials out to his own phone number from the
        meeting to join via the public switched telephone network (PSTN).
    -   If the meeting participants decide during the call that they want to add
        users at a different phone number, they can just dial out to the phone
        number and bring additional people into the meeting.
    -   Other users can also join from the Teams client on their PC, Mac, or mobile
        device.

- title: Considerations for Skype for Business customers
  durationInMinutes: 1
  content: |

    If you’re already using Skype for Business, you’ll need to consider the
    following:

    ###Skype for Business Server–homed users
    If you’re using Skype for Business Server, Teams meetings scheduled by users
    who are homed on Skype for Business on-premises will not include PSTN meeting
    coordinates. (This is documented in [Audio Conferencing troubleshooting and
    known
    issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/skypeforbusiness/audio-conferencing-in-office-365/audio-conferencing-troubleshooting-and-known-issues).)

    ###Skype for Business Online–homed users
    If users are homed in Skype for Business Online and are already enabled for
    Audio Conferencing, they’ll automatically be enabled for Audio Conferencing in
    Teams. The PIN they use for authenticating in meetings when they dial in will be
    the same for Skype for Business and Teams.

- title: Exercise – Configure Audio Conferencing
  durationInMinutes: 20
  content: |

    In this exercise, you’ll have the chance to test Audio Conferencing in Teams.
    Although we don’t describe how to perform every action, we recommend some
    scenarios to try out.

    ###Requirements
    -   An Office 365 tenant with appropriate licenses to use Teams
        -   We strongly recommend that you use a dedicated test tenant.
        -   If you don’t have a test tenant, you can sign up for a trial tenant at
            [Office 365 Enterprise E5
            Trial](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=698279).
        -   Don’t run any tests in your production environment. Changing settings or
            policies might have a negative impact on all users and might affect
            their user experience.
    -   At least two endpoints
        -   This can be two PCs, but you can also use the client on your mobile
            phone.
        -   A phone that can dial in to meetings and be dialed out to

    ###Suggested scenarios to test
    -   Enable users for Audio Conferencing.
    -   Set different conference bridge numbers for different users.
    -   Change the default conference bridge number for the tenant.
    -   Change settings for the conference bridge number (different languages).
    -   Change global settings for conference bridges (meeting entry and exit
        notifications, PIN length, email notifications).
    -   Observe the email being sent out to users.
    -   Schedule Teams meetings, and review the meeting invitation.
    -   Join a meeting from a phone.
    -   Dial out from a meeting to a phone.
    -   Use dual-tone multi-frequency controls while in a meeting to mute and unmute
        a phone.

    From a reporting perspective, you have two areas to look at:
    -   Usage: How many meetings take place?
    -   Quality: What is the quality of the meetings?

    You should carefully monitor both areas:
    -   Low usage means that users, for one reason or another, aren’t using the
        product. You can only determine the reasons by investigating further.
        Reasons can range from the perception that meetings are falling short of
        user requirements, to a lack of awareness or training, to quality problems.
    -   Low quality, on the other hand, means that there are issues with
        connectivity between users and Office 365. Low quality can lead to bad user
        experience and lower usage. Refer to [Office 365 Reports in the Admin Center - Microsoft Teams user
        activity](https://support.office.com/article/Office-365-Reports-in-the-Admin-Center-Microsoft-Teams-user-activity-07f67fc4-c0a4-4d3f-ad20-f40c7f6db524)
        (estimated reading time 5 minutes) to learn more about the usage reports.

    Managing quality is outside of the scope of this training, but see the following
    training material:

        service](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/1-drive-value-operate-my-service)
