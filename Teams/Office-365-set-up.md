# Turn on Teams in your organization

Microsoft Teams is turned on for all organizations. You can control access to Teams in your organization with user-level licensing. To learn more, see [Manage user access to Teams](user-access.md). To learn more about managing individual licenses, read [Microsoft Teams service description](/office365/servicedescriptions/teams-service-description).

As an administrator for your organization, you can assign user licenses to control individual access to Teams, and you can allow or block what content sources can be used in Teams. See [Manage Microsoft Teams settings for your organization](enable-features-office-365.md) or [Admin settings for apps in Microsoft Teams](admin-settings.md) for more information.
