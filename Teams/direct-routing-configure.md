# Configure Direct Routing

Microsoft Phone System Direct Routing enables you to connect your on-premises telephony infrastructure to Microsoft Teams. The article lists the high-level steps required for connecting a supported on-premises Session Border Controller (SBC) to Direct Routing, and how to configure Teams users to use Direct Routing to connect to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). This article links to associated articles for details.  

For information about whether Direct Routing is the right solution for your organization, see [Phone System Direct Routing](direct-routing-landing-page.md). For information about prerequisites and planning your deployment, see [Plan Direct Routing](direct-routing-plan.md).

> [!Tip]
> You can also watch the following session to learn about the benefits of Direct Routing, how to plan for it, and how to deploy it: [Direct Routing in Microsoft Teams](https://aka.ms/teams-direct-routing).

To complete the steps explained in this article, administrators need some familiarity with PowerShell cmdlets. For more information about using PowerShell, see [Set up your computer for Windows PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/set-up-your-computer-for-windows-powershell/set-up-your-computer-for-windows-powershell). 

Before performing the steps in these articles, Microsoft recommends that you confirm that your SBC has already been configured as recommended by your SBC vendor:
