# Security best practices for Microsoft Teams

Collaboration through instant messaging and video conferencing have allowed many industries and schools to continue their work during the pandemic. However, online real-time collaboration at such a broad scale also comes with *risks* that must be addressed. Otherwise, bad actors take advantage of this change in work and life with **phishing** and **spam** campaigns. The numbered reference list in this article acts as a primer for general security when using Teams to message others, and is training guidance for people new to Teams, or to any Instant Messaging, security.

The same phishing risks that exist in email exist in instant messaging and collaboration apps so the same user-awareness and guidance should be applied to safeguard Teams users.

At a user level, some measures can be simple, and users should feel empowered to rely on them. Users shouldn’t click to open links from anyone that they don’t know, or whose identity they can't verify as per the article [Protect yourself from phishing](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/protect-yourself-from-phishing-0c7ea947-ba98-3bd9-7184-430e1f860a44). And to protect against external attacks, tenant admins can disable or turn off enterprise federation and Teams for Life (TFL) and Skype interoperability, regarding [Manage external access (federation) - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Docs](/microsoftteams/manage-external-access).

The Teams collaboration feature set allows messaging, file collaboration, meetings, whiteboards, and many other opportunities to connect. These features work across Teams for Enterprise, Teams for Life, Skype, Skype for Business, Azure Communication Services (ACS), and more. That also means it’s necessary to protect yourself, your peers, and your customers across the breadth of these capabilities. Here, again, every user should be empowered to make the safest decision for themselves, their peers, and their customers.

## Just as with email, online safety must be practiced in Microsoft Teams messaging

Standard safety measures should become ingrained while working in Teams.

1. Be wary of contacts and meeting requests from outside of your organization. Strangers can be well meaning. And some can secretly mean harm.
2. If you don’t recognize the sender, you can check the known global address list of your company for their identity and escalate any communications you can’t verify to a higher level for handling. When in doubt, do not interact with unknown and unverified users.
3. If you receive a link or file from an unknown person, do not click on it. Again, use your best judgement for your own, and the safety of other users, as well as your customers.
4. If a clicked link navigation lands you on a safe links page where you are blocked from navigation, do not try to circumvent that page (the same goes for any clicked attachment that may end in a red, blocking safe attachments page). If you know and trust the target site, report the problem to Microsoft and to whomever directed you there. But there are many reasons to land on a blocking page, and red flags should be considered, rather than circumnavigated.
5. Never give personal information out to any unsolicited requests. This is also a risk to personal safety. Details as simple as your birthday can be leveraged by attackers.
6. Scan your links for iffy spelling, added digits, or strange characters. You may be expecting a link to `www.litware.com/strategies/Metricsbreakout.xlsx`, but find that the address looks like `www.litwre.com`, `www.litwarecom.com`, or even `www.litwαre.com`. If you don’t recognize the link, be suspicious. The address `www.litware.com` is not the same as `www.litware2021.com`.

It is important to maintain your vigilance and not take your security, and the security of those you work with lightly, or for granted. As individual users, you should always feel empowered to protect yourself and your peers and customers through verifying before you trust.

Finally, it's also critical to recognize that everyone makes mistakes. Users can be prone to clicking when in a hurry, for example, or when tired. Admins should make sure the resources to escalate problem link clicks and other security incidents to are clearly known to users in their organization, so that, if a mistake is made, the user has recourse, and further security actions can be taken.

> [!TIP]
> Check the Profile card of any contact you’re not sure about, particularly if the email is external to your company (for example, an account ending in *@litware.com* if your organization is not *Litware*). A user can verify that people they don't know are welcome Guests to a meeting by checking the Profile card for **(GUEST)**. Guests are expressly invited to participate.
