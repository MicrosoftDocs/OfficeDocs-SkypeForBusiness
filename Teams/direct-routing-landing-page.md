# Phone System Direct Routing

You've completed [Get started](get-started-with-teams-quick-start.md). You've rolled out Teams with [chat, teams, channels, & apps](deploy-chat-teams-channels-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md) across your organization. Maybe you've deployed [Meetings & conferencing](deploy-meetings-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md). Now you're ready to add cloud voice workloads, and you've decided to use your own telephony carrier for Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) connectivity by using Phone System Direct Routing. With Direct Routing, you can use Phone System with virtually any telephony carrier.

This article describes core deployment decisions for Direct Routing as well as additional considerations you may want to think about, based on your organization's needs. You should also read [Cloud Voice in Microsoft Teams](cloud-voice-landing-page.md) for more information about Microsoft's cloud voice offerings.

## Learn more about Direct Routing

The following articles provide more information about configuring and using Phone System Direct Routing. Configuring Direct Routing requires understanding of PSTN routing design. You should read all of these articles to understand how to plan and configure Direct Routing:

- [Plan Direct Routing](direct-routing-plan.md) 
- [Configure Direct Routing](direct-routing-configure.md)
- [List of Session Border Controllers certified for Direct Routing](direct-routing-border-controllers.md)
- [Monitor and troubleshoot Direct Routing](direct-routing-monitor-and-troubleshoot.md)

In addition, you might want to read the following articles depending on your requirements:

-  [Configure a Session Border Controller for multiple tenants](direct-routing-sbc-multiple-tenants.md)
-  [Migrate to Direct Routing](direct-routing-migrating.md)
-  [User accounts in a hybrid environment with PSTN connectivity](direct-routing-user-accounts-in-a-hybrid-environment.md)
- Watch the following session to learn more about Direct Routing: [Direct Routing in Microsoft Teams](https://aka.ms/teams-direct-routing)

## Core deployment decisions

These are the core decisions to consider for Direct Routing. 

|Ask yourself|Action |
| :------------|:-------|
|For which users will I enable Direct Routing? | For more information, see [Enable users for Direct Routing Service](direct-routing-configure.md#enable-users-for-direct-routing-service). |
Do I have the required licenses for Direct Routing? | For more information, see [Licensing and other requirements](direct-routing-plan.md#licensing-and-other-requirements).
|||

### Session Border Controller (SBC) considerations

With Direct Routing, you connect your own Session Border Controller (SBC) directly to Phone System.  For a list of certified SBCs, see [Supported Session Border Controllers](direct-routing-border-controllers.md).

|Ask yourself|Action |
|:------------|:-------|
| Where and how will I deploy SBCs? | For more information, see [Configure Direct Routing](direct-routing-configure.md) | 
Do I have multiple tenants? | For more information, see [Configure a Session Border Controller for multiple tenants](direct-routing-sbc-multiple-tenants.md).|
|||

### Voice routing considerations

You'll need to configure Phone System to route the calls to the specific SBCs.

|Ask yourself|Action |
|:------------|:-------|
| What voice routing policies, PSTN usage, and voice routes do I need to create? | For voice routing  information, see [Configure Voice Routing](direct-routing-configure.md#configure-voice-routing).
| Which users will be assigned to the voice routing policy that I define? | See the examples in [Configure Voice Routing](direct-routing-configure.md#configure-voice-routing). |
|||

### Calling and interop policies

Direct Routing is only supported with Microsoft Teams. To place or receive PSTN calls through Direct Routing, you need to configure the necessary policies to ensure incoming calls are received in Teams. You can configure users to set Teams as their preferred client for calls by either configuring the user for Teams Only mode or configuring Teams as the preferred calling client by assigning the TeamsCallingPolicy and the TeamsInteropPolicy.

|Ask yourself|Action |
|:------------|:-------|
|How will I set Teams as the preferred client for calls? | For more information, see [Set Microsoft Teams as the preferred calling client for users](direct-routing-configure.md#set-microsoft-teams-as-the-preferred-calling-client-for-users).|
|||

## Additional deployment considerations

You may want to consider the following, based on your organization's needs and configuration:

| Ask yourself| Action |
| :------------|:-------|
| Do you have an existing Skype for Business Server deployment with hybrid connectivity configured? |  To understand how user accounts in a hybrid environment are provisioned and managed, see [User accounts in a hybrid environment with PSTN connectivity](direct-routing-user-accounts-in-a-hybrid-environment.md).| 
| Are you migrating to Direct Routing from Calling Plan or from a Skype for Business on-premises environment? | To understand more about migrating to Direct Routing from an existing environment, see [Migrating to Direct Routing](direct-routing-migrating.md). |
