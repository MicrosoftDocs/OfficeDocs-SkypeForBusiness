This article is part of the User Readiness stage of your upgrade journey, an activity you complete in parallel with the Technical Readiness stage. Before proceeding, confirm that you’ve completed these activities from previous stages:

- [Enlisted your project stakeholders](upgrade-enlist-stakeholders.md)
- [Defined your project scope](https://aka.ms/SkypetoTeams-Scope)
- [Understood coexistence and interoperability of Skype for Business and Teams](https://aka.ms/SkypeToTeams-Coexist)
- [Chosen your upgrade journey](upgrade-and-coexistence-of-skypeforbusiness-and-teams.md)

# Prepare a user readiness plan

An optimal user readiness plan incorporates how you’ll communicate with, train, and support your users as you pilot, onboard, and upgrade to Teams. As you discovered in [Assess organizational change readiness](https://aka.ms/OrgReadiness), readiness is not one-size-fits-all. To ensure optimal receptiveness to the new technology, use a combination of broad-reach messaging (incorporating the vision/value messaging and universal use cases) and messaging, training, and support tailored to the personas and cohorts you’ve defined and also to your laggards, as appropriate. This personalized plan will help facilitate user adoption by enabling users to more quickly relate to Teams, while demonstrating that you understand their needs.

> [!Tip]
> Download the [Upgrade Success Kit](https://aka.ms/UpgradeSuccessKit) for template user readiness materials, such as communications and user surveys, in addition to a sample upgrade project plan and pilot test plan.
