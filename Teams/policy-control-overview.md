# Policy control overview for Microsoft Teams

Microsoft is committed to providing you with the information and controls you need to make choices about how your data is collected and used when you’re using Microsoft Teams, a part of Microsoft 365.

This article is intended to provide you with information about privacy controls for the following areas:

- **Diagnostic data** that is collected and sent to Microsoft about Teams and Office software being used on computers running Windows in your organization.
- **Connected experiences** that use cloud-based functionality to provide enhanced Teams and Office features to you and your users.

As part of these changes, there are new and updated user interface (UI) elements and policy settings

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For further reading, please review the [Policy Control Overview](/deployoffice/privacy/overview-privacy-controls) content for M365.

## Diagnostic data sent from Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise to Microsoft

Diagnostic data is used to:

- Keep Teams secure and up-to-date.
- Detect, diagnose and remediate problems.
- Make product improvements.

An example of some of the collected data includes:

- Application language
- User type
- Build version of the OS

## Clients that adhere to diagnostic controls

The following clients adhere to diagnostic controls and will submit data:

- iOS
- Android
- Desktop (only the component that is using the win32 API)

For required mobile data diagnostics, see [Policy control diagnostic data for mobile](policy-control-diagnostic-data-mobile.md).

For required desktop data diagnostics, see [Policy control diagnostic data for desktop](policy-control-diagnostic-data-desktop.md).

## Diagnostic data sent from the Teams app to Microsoft

This diagnostic data is collected and sent to Microsoft about Teams software being used on computers running Windows in your organization.

There are three levels of diagnostic data for Teams software that you can choose from:

- **Required** The minimum data necessary to help keep Office secure, up-to-date, and performing as expected on the device it’s installed on.
- **Optional** Additional data that helps us make product improvements and provides enhanced information to help us detect, diagnose, and remediate issues.
- **Neither** No diagnostic data about Teams software running on the user’s device is collected and sent to us. This option, however, significantly limits our ability to detect, diagnose, and remediate problems your users may encounter using Teams.

Required diagnostic data could include, for example, information about the version of Teams client installed on the device, or include information that indicates that the Teams application is crashing when trying to join a meeting. Optional diagnostic data could include information about the time it takes to initiate a phone call, which could indicate an issue with connectivity or network performance.

If you choose to send us optional diagnostic data, required diagnostic data is also included.

As an admin for your organization, you’ll be able to use a policy setting to choose which level of diagnostic data is sent to us. Optional diagnostic data will be sent to Microsoft unless you change the setting. Providing optional diagnostic data better enables the Office engineering team at Microsoft to detect, diagnose, and mitigate issues to reduce impacts to your organization.

Your users won’t be able to change the diagnostic data level for their devices if they are signed in to Teams with their organizational credentials, which is sometimes referred to as a work or school account.

This diagnostic data doesn’t include names of users, their email addresses, or the content of their Office files. Our system creates a unique ID that it associates with your user’s diagnostic data. When we receive diagnostic data showing that the Teams app crashed 100 times, this unique ID lets us determine if it was a single user who crashed 100 times or if it was 100 different users who each crashed once. We don’t use this unique ID to identify a specific user.

## Required service data for connected experiences

Required service data is data that enables us to deliver these cloud-based connected experiences and help make these experiences secure and perform as expected. Three types of information make up required service data.

- **Customer content**, which is content you create using Office, such as text typed in a Word document.
- **Functional data**, which includes information needed by a connected experience to perform its task, such as configuration information about the app.
- **Service diagnostic data**, which is the data necessary to keep the service secure, up to date, and performing as expected. Because this data is strictly related to the connected experience, it is separate from required or optional diagnostic data levels.

You can choose to not offer this functionality to your users, in which case this information will not be provided to Microsoft to support the functionality of connected experiences. You can learn more about [required service data](/deployoffice/privacy/required-service-data).

## Essential services for Microsoft Teams

There are also a set of services that are essential to how Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise functions and cannot be disabled. For example, the licensing service that confirms that you are properly licensed to use Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise. Required service data about these services is collected and sent to Microsoft, regardless of any other policy settings that you have configured.
