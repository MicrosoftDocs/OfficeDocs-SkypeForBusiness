# Use manufacturing team templates in the admin center

Team templates in Microsoft Teams allow you to quickly and easily create teams by providing a predefined team structure of settings, channels, and pre-installed apps.

Use team templates to quickly deploy consistent teams across your organization. Templates also help staff to get oriented with how to effectively use Teams.

Teams includes pre-built templates designed for manufacturing needs. In this article, we introduce you to these templates.

To learn more about team templates in general, see [Get started with team templates](get-started-with-teams-templates-in-the-admin-console.md).

## Quality and Safety

Centralize communication, access to resources, and plant operations with a Manufacturing Plant team. Include policy and procedure documents, training videos, safety notices, shift handover processes.
