# Use manufacturing team templates

Team templates in Microsoft Teams allow you to quickly and easily create teams by providing a predefined team structure of settings, channels, and preinstalled apps.

Use team templates to quickly deploy consistent teams across your organization. Templates also help staff to get oriented with how to effectively use Teams.

As an admin, you can manage team templates in the Microsoft Teams admin center. You can use the [prebuilt templates](get-started-with-teams-templates-in-the-admin-console.md#pre-built-team-templates-in-the-teams-admin-center) that we provide and create your own templates [from scratch](create-a-team-template.md), from [an existing team](create-template-from-existing-team.md), and from [an existing template](create-template-from-existing-template.md). You can also [create and assign templates policies](templates-policies.md) to your staff to control which templates they see in Teams for [creating teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-team-with-team-templates-702a2977-e662-4038-bef5-bdf8ee47b17b).

Teams includes the following prebuilt template designed for manufacturing needs. To learn more about team templates in general, see [Get started with team templates in the Teams admin center](get-started-with-teams-templates-in-the-admin-console.md).

## Quality and Safety

Centralize communication, access to resources, and plant operations with your team. Include policy and procedure documents, training videos, safety notices, shift handover processes.
