   Supporting Microsoft’s intelligent communications vision, Microsoft Teams is the
   central hub for teamwork, bringing together chat, meetings, calling,
   collaboration, app integration, and file storage. As an existing Skype for
   Business customer, you’re invited to upgrade to Microsoft Teams, to experience
   this full suite of communication and collaboration capabilities in a single
   client experience.

   To get a better understanding of the journey, please review the [Your Journey

  durationInMinutes: 2
  content: |

   Microsoft provides a comprehensive framework to help you plan and execute
   the upgrade. The framework comes in two different flavors: Upgrade Basic for
   less complex environments and smaller deployments, and Upgrade Pro for larger
   companies with heavy usage of Skype for Business features. In both cases, the
   framework includes the following phases:

   ![Illustration of the Teams upgarde journey](media/upgrade-banner-main.png "The framework will guide you through the following phases: Project Stakeholders; Project Definition; Technical Readiness and User Readiness; Deployment and Implementation; Operational Excellence.")

   ### Upgrade Basic

   Designed for smaller organizations or those using Skype for Business Online for
   IM (chat) and meetings only, the Upgrade Basic checklist is an accelerated
   action plan that includes core, recommended activities and associated resources
   for implementing a successful move from Skype for Business to Teams.

   These ten easy steps provide everything you need for a successful upgrade.
   They’re designed to be completed in about 30 to 45 days, but you should adjust
   task completion dates based on your organization’s upgrade schedule.

   ### Upgrade Pro

   Designed for larger organizations or those with complex deployments of Skype for
   Business (for example, hybrid or cloud voice deployments), Upgrade Pro accounts
   for a longer upgrade lifecycle along with a variety of upgrade scenarios,
   including running Microsoft Teams alongside Skype for Business until Teams is
   ready for your organization.

   Segmented into three phases, Upgrade Pro covers:
   -   **Pre-upgrade**: Start realizing the value of Teams as you prepare for your
   upgrade over time. Consider these steps an upgrade prerequisite to help
   ensure a positive experience as you transition to Teams when it’s ready for
   you. If your organization has already been running Teams alongside Skype for
   Business, use these pre-upgrade activities as a validation checkpoint for
   your organization’s readiness to upgrade users to Teams.
   -   **Upgrade**: When your organization is ready for users to stop using Skype
   for Business, you’ll want to ensure they have ample notice to get training
   and start using Teams (if they haven’t already). You’ll also want to take
   steps such as moving their Skype for Business meetings to Teams to ensure an
   optimal experience.
   -   **Post-upgrade**: After your entire organization is on Teams, implement a
   plan to maximize value. This includes monitoring your network for quality,
   promoting adoption of Teams while ensuring that Skype for Business usage is
   winding down, and planning for expanded functionality as the Teams roadmap
   continues to evolve.

   ## Which one to choose?

   There is no single indicator that will dictate if Basic or Pro is the right
   choice for your deployment. However, the following table should help you to
   determine which approach is better suited:

   As in every project, it’s always a good idea to have a plan in place to
   set yourself up for success. For the upgrade, the planning phase includes the
   following two components: Enlisting your stakeholders and defining the project
   scope.

   ### Enlist your project stakeholders

   From implementing project deliverables to driving accountability, your
   stakeholders hold the key to the success of your project. There are two groups
   of stakeholders you’ll want to assign:

   1.  A sponsorship coalition that includes executive and project sponsors who
   have a vested interest in and influence on the project’s success.

   2.  The project team, consisting of the people responsible for ensuring
   technical and user readiness, who will complete the various tasks in the
   project plan.

   The common thread between these two groups is the project manager, who works to
   ensure that project tasks get completed on schedule and reports project status
   back to the coalition.

   Optionally, you can create a steering committee. Sometimes large or more complex
   projects end up with conflicting or fragmented leadership roles, resulting in disconnects
   among the stakeholder groups. For these projects, you might want to form a
   steering committee. A steering committee is responsible for driving decisions,
   providing strategic oversight, supporting the project’s initiatives, and—when
   necessary—removing blockers.

   ### Define your project scope

   Taking time to define your project vision, scope, goals, and governance will
   help ensure all project stakeholders are aligned and working toward the same end
   results. This is especially critical given that the technical readiness team and
   user readiness team will be working independently to pull their respective
   pieces together while remaining tightly aligned on needed capabilities, business 
   scenarios, and project timelines. After you complete the project scope, refer to 
   it throughout your project to ensure you’re on track to achieve the end state you 
   wanted. Use the goals that you identify below to measure against your outcomes 
   and mitigate as needed.

   The project scope usually consists of the following components

   -   **Project vision**: The “big picture” or eventual end-state that answers the
   question, “Why are we doing this project?” An ideal vision addresses your
   organization’s business drivers and user value-add perspectives.

   -   **Project scope**: Your vision might only be realized over time, through
   various phases. The project scope defines the focus of your project at this
   time and serves to keep your project team focused on their current tasks,
   enabling you to realize your long-term vision.

   -   **Project goals**: Your goals define the outcome you want and enable you to
   measure the success of the project. Goals can be defined as objectives and
   key results (OKRs), and the measures of project success can be defined as
   key success indicators (KSIs). It’s essential that you get full
   participation from project stakeholders in defining OKRs and KSIs, to help
   ensure they feel a sense of ownership and align these measures of success to
   defined project tasks. Goals should include a mix of organizational, technical, and
   user-focused success measures.

   The actual migration from Skype for Business to Teams can be conducted with
   different approaches. Please read [Migration and interoperability guidance for
   organizations using Teams together with Skype for

   ### Environmental readiness

   Skype for Business and Teams both offer you real-time communication based on the
   same technology. The quality of your audio and video calls will directly affect
   user experience, and both heavily rely on network quality. Any improvement you
   can make today to network quality for Skype for Business will directly benefit
   the quality users will experience on Teams. Therefore, we highly recommend
   optimizing your network for Skype for Business to make your users (even more)
   happy today and give them a great start on Teams from day one.

   ### Network readiness assessment

   You should perform a Network Readiness Assessment before deploying any real-time
   communications product such as Skype for Business or Teams, then run it on a
   regular basis afterwards. If you haven’t conducted a network readiness
   assessment at all or in quite some time, you absolutely should do so before
   introducing Teams.

   The Network Readiness Assessment focuses on network performance, network
   planning, and other general networking aspects such as ports and protocols that
   must be opened. Even if you’re currently using a real-time communications
   product, such as Skype for Business, the Network Readiness Assessment will help
   validate your network readiness.
 
   ### Quality assessment

   Make sure that your current Skype for Business deployment meets the quality bar
   when it comes to real-time media. Use Call Quality Dashboard (CQD) to monitor
   usage and identify quality trends, and Call Analytics to troubleshoot or look at
   quality indicators of individual calls.
 
   ### Quality champion role

   Organizations should identify a person, or group of people, for the role of
   Quality Champion. The quality champion reviews quality metrics against usage,
   identifying quality trends and areas for improvement.
 
   The quality champion is the go-to person for any call-quality related issues and
   should act as the subject matter expert (SME) for the identification of quality
   issues by reviewing ongoing usage and quality trends and identifying action
   items. The quality champion should work with the respective teams to drive
   remediation actions, reporting to a steering committee on the progress and open
   issues. The best candidate for the quality champion is typically the customer
   service owner. Depending on the organization size and complexity, any person who
   is passionate about user experience and has the skills to identify trends can
   act as a quality champion, supported by the right level of sponsorship to work
   with other teams to drive remediation.

   ### Environmental dependencies

   As we’ve already mentioned, Teams leverages existing Office 365 infrastructure.
   Be sure to meet all requirements—for links to detailed information, see the list
   below.

   To realize maximum value from Teams, users must actually use it, but getting
   users to change the way they work isn’t always easy. Taking time to understand
   your users and design the right readiness plan can help facilitate change and
   accelerate adoption of Teams. These activities should be completed in parallel
   with your technical readiness preparation:

   -   Assessing organizational change readiness: This includes understanding who
   your users are, how they’ll use the new technology, and how readily they
   adapt to change. This is also an opportunity to identify specific user
   profiles who would benefit from focused onboarding. Read [Assessing
   organizational change
   readiness](https://aka.ms/OrgReadiness)
   (estimated reading time 9 minutes) to learn more.

   -   Defining and prioritizing high-value business scenarios that will provide 
   clear value to the organization is essential to materializing real change. This 
   involves getting feedback from selected portions of your user community about how 
   they’re currently collaborating and communicating, and identifying their pain 
   points. This will provide you with a map of the scenarios that can be improved as 
   you make the transition to Teams.  

   -   Preparing a user readiness plan: Consisting of awareness, training, and
   support activities, your readiness plan should address both your broad user
   base and targeted profiles, as identified in the assessing change readiness
   activity. Read [Preparing a user readiness
   plan](https://aka.ms/UserReadinessPlan)
   (estimated reading time 2 minutes) for more details.

   **Pilot Teams alongside Skype for Business**

   After you’ve verified that your environment is ready to run Teams, you can start
   a Teams pilot. Skype for Business and Teams offer overlapping functionality—
   that’s why it’s helpful to start your journey with a pilot.

   *Watch the video "Running a Teams Pilot" (3:30 minutes)*
   > [!Video https://www.youtube.com/embed/q8F81DlbwEM]

   The pilot is a small-scale deployment that lets you validate the
   interoperability with Skype for Business in your environment, in addition to
   understanding how your users can maximize their productivity while minimizing
   confusion with both products running side-by-side.

   Piloting Teams side-by-side with Skype for Business gives you several benefits:

   -   Your IT organization learns how to use and manage Teams.

   -   Your Change Management and Adoption teams confirm organizational readiness
   and validate resources and procedures needed on a larger scale prior to your
   organization-wide rollout.

   -   Your users get the benefits of Teams without losing the tools they’re
   already familiar with.

   Learn all about how to [Conduct a user
   pilot](https://aka.ms/SkypeToTeams-Pilot)
   (estimated reading time 6 minutes)

   We also recommend that you plan a Teams implementation with Teams. This will 
   build usage skills within the project group who is working on this implementation.  
   Centralizing feedback, resources, and conversations about your Teams experience 
   will help your organization in the long run.
