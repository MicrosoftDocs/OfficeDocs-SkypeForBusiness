# Phone numbers for Audio Conferencing in Microsoft Teams

When you are setting up **Audio Conferencing** for Microsoft Teams, dial-in phone numbers are automatically assigned to your organization. To see the phone numbers that are assigned to your audio conferencing bridge, in the Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business Admin Center, go to  **Meetings** > **Conference bridges**. For more information, go to [See a list of Audio Conferencing numbers](see-a-list-of-audio-conferencing-numbers-in-teams.md).
  
  
## Audio Conferencing coverage and pricing

For a complete list of all the countries/regions and cities where Audio Conferencing is available, see [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md). For pricing information, see [Pricing for Audio Conferencing](https://products.office.com/skype-for-business/audio-conferencing#Requirements).
  
## Dial-in phone numbers in a meeting invite

When a Microsoft Teams user schedules a meeting in Outlook or Outlook Web App, the default audio conferencing number that is set for the user is included in the meeting invite. If you want to select a different default number for one or more users, you can change that by going to **Users**, selecting the user, and editing the user's Audio Conferencing settings. See [Set the phone numbers included on invites](set-the-phone-numbers-included-on-invites-in-teams.md).
  
  
## Dial-in phone numbers set on an audio conferencing bridge

There are two types of audio conferencing phone numbers that can be assigned to your conferencing bridge: **Shared** and **Dedicated**. Both types of these numbers can be used by any caller to join audio meetings that are being held in your organization.
  
- **Dedicated phone numbers** are those phone numbers that are only available to users within your organization. You can change the languages that are used when someone calls in to one of these numbers.
  
- **Shared phone numbers** are those phone numbers that can be shared with other Office 365 organizations. You can't change the languages that are used when someone calls in to one of these numbers.
  
While the default audio conferencing number that is assigned to an organizer is only included in the meeting invite, a caller can use any of the phone numbers that are assigned to your conferencing bridge to join a meeting. The list of phone numbers that can be used to join a meeting is available using the **Find a local number** link that is included on every meeting invite.
  
## Automatically assigned audio conferencing phone numbers

Shared audio conferencing phone numbers are automatically assigned to organizations when they're enabled for audio conferencing. When the phone numbers are assigned, a phone number is assigned as the default phone number of the conferencing bridge. The phone number assigned as the default number of the bridge will be one from the country/region of the organization.

To see a list of those countries/regions that have phone numbers automatically assigned to organizations, see [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md).
    
> [!NOTE]
> The country or region location of your organization can be found by signing in to the **Office 365 admin center** and looking under **Organization Profile**. 
  
> [!CAUTION]
> Due to limited availability of toll phone numbers in Venezuela, Indonesia, and United Arab Emirates (UAE), organizations from these countries/regions won't have an Audio Conferencing toll number automatically assigned to them. Toll-free numbers from these locations are available depending on available inventory.
