# Which Calling Plan is right for you? 

You've completed the [Get started](get-started-with-teams-quick-start.md). You've rolled out Teams with [chat, teams, channels, & apps](deploy-chat-teams-channels-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md) across your organization. Maybe you've deployed [Meetings & conferencing](deploy-meetings-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md). Now you're ready to add cloud voice workloads, and you've decided to use Microsoft Phone System with Calling Plan to connect to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). 

This article describes core deployment decisions for Calling Plans as well as additional considerations you may want to configure, based on your organization's needs. You should also read [Cloud Voice in Microsoft Teams](cloud-voice-landing-page.md) for more information about Microsoft's cloud voice offerings.

## Core deployment decisions

To use Microsoft as your telephony carrier, you need to obtain Calling Plan licenses and assign them to your Phone System users. 

There are two types of Calling Plans available:

- Domestic Calling Plans 
- Domestic and International Calling Plans

### Transfer phone numbers to Office 365

It's easy to transfer your phone numbers from your current service provider to Teams. After you port your phone numbers to Teams, Microsoft will become your service provider and will bill you for those phone numbers. For more information, see [Transfer phone numbers to Office 365](transfer-phone-numbers-to-office-365.md).


### Phone numbers and emergency locations

With Calling Plans in Office 365, every user in your organization needs to have a unique direct inward dial (DID) phone number and a corresponding validated emergency address. You can also specify an emergency location within the emergency address (for example, an office number or floor number). 

|Ask yourself|Action |
|:------------|:-------|
|How detailed do I want the emergency address and location information to be? |For more information, see [What are emergency locations, addresses, and call routing?](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/what-are-emergency-locations-addresses-and-call-routing).


### Calling identity

By default, all outbound calls use the assigned phone number as calling identity (caller ID). The recipient of the call can quickly identify the caller and decide whether to accept or reject the call.

|Ask yourself|Action |
|:------------|:-------|
|Do I want to mask or disable caller ID? | To change or block the caller ID, see [Set the caller ID for a user](set-the-caller-id-for-a-user.md). |
