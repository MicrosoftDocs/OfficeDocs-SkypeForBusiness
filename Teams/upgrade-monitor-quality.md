This article is part of the Operational Excellence stage of your upgrade journey, which begins as soon as you've completed your upgrade from Skype for Business to Teams.

# Quality of Experience Review Guide

The [Quality of Experience Review Guide](https://aka.ms/qerguide) includes a set of activities that assess and provide remediation guidance in key areas that have the greatest impact on improving the user experience, as illustrated below.

![The key areas to examine during a Quality of Experience Review: audio, reliability, and user survey results.](media/plan-my-service-management-image2.png "The key areas to examine during a Quality of Experience Review: audio, reliability, and user survey results.")

By continually assessing and remediating the areas described in the guide, you can reduce their potential to negatively affect user experience. Most user-experience problems encountered in a deployment can be grouped into the following categories:

-   Incomplete firewall or proxy configuration

-   Poor Wi-Fi coverage

-   Insufficient bandwidth

-   VPN

-   Use of unoptimized or built-in audio devices

-   Problematic subnets or network devices

The guidance provided in the Quality of Experience Review Guide focuses on using Call Quality Dashboard (CQD) Online as the primary tool to report and investigate each area described, with a focus on audio to maximize adoption and impact. Any optimizations made to the network to improve the audio experience will also directly translate to improvements in video and desktop sharing.

We highly recommend that you nominate the quality champion early on. After being nominated, they should start to familiarize themselves with the content in the [Quality of Experience Review Guide](https://aka.ms/qerguide).
