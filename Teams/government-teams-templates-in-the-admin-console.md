# Use government team templates in the admin center

Team templates allow you to quickly and easily create teams by providing a predefined template of settings, channels, and pre-installed apps.

Team templates have pre-built definitions of team structures designed around governmental needs. You can also extend the team templates to create teams that are tailored to your specific organizational needs.

In this article, we introduce each of the team templates and recommend how to use them.

This article is for you if you're responsible for planning, deploying, and managing multiple teams across your governmental organization. You've already deployed Teams service in your organization. If you haven't yet rolled out Teams, start by reading the [How to roll out Microsoft Teams](./deploy-overview.md).

To learn more about team templates in general, refer to [Get started with team templates](get-started-with-teams-templates-in-the-admin-console.md).

## Coordinate incident response

Centralize communication and critical resources for your crisis management or incident response team. Within this team, you can include many different types of files to help create a central place for all your documents. Use online meetings to improve information flow and situational awareness.
