# Create your first teams in Microsoft Teams

The best way to drive adoption of Teams is to use the product. We recommend that you manage your Office 365 deployment with Teams. You should also create a community of employees who are focused on teamwork and productivity. (These initial teams may change over time.) Some suggested teams are:

| Team name | Proposed channel names |
| --------- | ---------------------- |
| Get to know Teams | General</br> Say hi</br> How do I?</br>Feedback </br> Ideas for future teams </br> Support |
| Microsoft Teams Implementation | General <br/> Awareness and Adoption <br/> Business Engagement <br/> Early Adopter Program <br/> Feedback and Insights <br/> Security and Compliance <br/> Strategy and Planning <br/> Service Health and Incidents <br/> Training <br/> Watercooler Chat |
| Teamwork Champions | General <br/> Best Practices, Training, and How To <br/> Champion Corner <br/> Feedback and Support <br/> Program Leads <br/> Social Hub |

Within Microsoft Teams, the [tab gallery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/tabs/tabs-overview) gives you access to all Office 365 and third-party apps that have been turned on by the administrator. To get the most value from your product, we suggest pinning key resources as tabs in each of the appropriate channels. See the example below.

In your initial teams, we suggest pinning the following items for easy reference in your team channels. These assets are in addition to your OneNote notebook sections. If you're working with our FastTrack team, they will assist you in configuring these first teams.

## Making the switch to Microsoft Teams

As you begin to use Teams, it will be important for you and the rest of the project team to commit to using Teams chat, channels, and resources to run your project. Your own usage of Teams is critical to the quality of your adoption project. We recommend that you resist fragmenting your project by continuing to have conversations with the core project team in email. By switching to Teams you will model the behavior you ultimately want your employees to embrace. Set the tone, go first, and begin to enjoy having your project information in one place!
