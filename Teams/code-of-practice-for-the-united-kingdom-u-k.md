# Calling plans in Office 365 - Code of practice for the United Kingdom (U.K.)

This Code applies to small business customers (organizations with 10 employees or less) in the United Kingdom (UK) with respect to the Office 365 Calling Plan service (the "Service") in accordance with UK communications regulations. Other Skype for Business services are governed by your service agreement with Microsoft and any other terms applicable to your use of the particular service.

## 1. About Skype for Business

Skype for Business is provided in the UK by Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited, which has its registered office at 70 Sir John Rogerson's Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland.

## 2. Customer service

If you have any sales, billing, or technical support questions, you may contact us either by phone during normal business hours or online:

Toll-Free Phone Number: 0800 032 6417

Online: Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center and submit a service request by selecting **New service request** under **Support**.

Normal business hours are Monday through Friday, from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm.

You may be able to answer some of your questions by visiting the [Skype for Business website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=820709&amp;clcid=0x809).

## 3. Complaints and dispute resolution

Our top priorities are customer satisfaction and excellent service. However, in the event that you have a complaint, we will work quickly to help you resolve your issue. Our [Calling Plans in Office 365 - complaint handling code for the United Kingdom (U.K.)](complaint-handling-code-for-the-united-kingdom-u-k.md) page details the procedures for small businesses to file a complaint with us and our independent dispute resolution scheme.
  
## 4. Number porting

Skype for Business in some cases may be unable to transfer a customer's telephone number for use with the Service. Where number portability is available, Skype for Business will take all reasonable steps to ensure that the transfer of the number and subsequent activation is completed promptly once an agreement to transfer the number has been reached with the customer's current service provider.

## 5. Service reliability

Office 365 Calling Plan relies on your broadband connection. If your broadband connection experiences a power cut or failure, you will not be able to make telephone calls. The causes for these failures may be outside of our control.

## 6. Emergency calls

Skype for Business provides access to 999/112 public emergency call services to customers within England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, emergency calls to 999 or 112 operate differently with Office 365 Calling Plan services than on traditional telephone services. Customers are required to notify each user of the Office 365 Calling Plan services of these differences.

The differences include the following: (i) Skype for Business may not know the actual location of a caller, which could result in the emergency services being despatched to the wrong location; (ii) when a Skype for Business user dials an emergency call, the user may be asked by an operator to provide his or her current location to assist in properly routing the emergency call and despatching emergency services; (iii) if the user's device has no power, is experiencing a power outage or, for any reason, cannot otherwise access the Internet, the user cannot make an emergency call through Office 365 Calling Plan services; and (iv) although Office 365 Calling Plan services can be used anywhere in the world where an Internet connection is available, users should not call 999 or 112 outside England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland because the call likely will not be routed to the appropriate emergency service.

It is important that each customer registers the location of your users and keeps this information updated so that it can be provided to the emergency services. You can make changes to location information online through the Skype for Business administrator portal.

## 7. Refund policy

Our refund policy is stated in your service agreement.

## 8. Contract terms and conditions

Standard contract conditions for the Service are provided in your service agreement.

## 9. Subscription fees and charges

Information about subscription plans and usage charges (including Premium Rate Services and National Translation Services number charges) can be found on [Skype for Business website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=820709&amp;clcid=0x809).

## 10. Directory listing

If you would like a Directory Enquiry listing (including an entry in the Phone Book) for your telephone number, it can be provided for an additional fee. For further details, please contact us using our contact information provided in Section 2.

## 11. Users with disabilities

This Code and the Complaints Handling Code are available in large print or audio format.

## 12. Premium rate services

### What are premium rate services?

Premium Rate Services are telephone numbers that render information and entertainment that are charged to your telephone bill. Premium Rate Services include, but are not limited to, charity donations, voting lines (i.e. Britain's Got Talent), directory enquiries, gambling lines, and adult services lines (i.e. dating). Calls to Premium Rate Services are more expensive than calls to other landline numbers and begin with 0871, 0872, 0873, 118, and 09.

Premium Rate Services are delivered by service providers ("Service Providers"). Service Providers either (a) provide the goods or services or (b) act as resellers or aggregators on behalf of a number of such providers.

### How do premium rate services work?

Skype for Business sends your Premium Rate Services call to another telephone company ("Terminating Communications Provider") which receives the call on behalf of the Services Provider. While Premium Rate Services revenue is divided amongst the Services Provider, Skype for Business, and the Terminating Communications Provider, most of the revenue is received by the Services Provider.

### Charges

All usage charges for Premium Rate Services can be found on our [website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=820709&amp;clcid=0x809). The duration of a call for calling premium rate numbers shall be based on one-minute increments. Fractions of minutes will be rounded up to the next minute. The connection fee, where applicable, will be charged at the beginning of the call.

### Telephone preference service and fax preference services

Telephone Preference Service ("TPS"), which is operated by the Direct Marketing Association on behalf of Ofcom, is a register that enables customers to opt-out of receiving unsolicited sales calls. If you would like to register with the TPS, you may do so at [https://www.tpsservices.co.uk/tps-services-for-consumers/register-on-the-tps.aspx](https://www.tpsservices.co.uk/tps-services-for-consumers/register-on-the-tps.aspx) or by calling 0843 005 9576.

Like TPS, Fax Preference Service ("FPS") is a register where businesses and individuals may opt-out of receiving unsolicited sales and market faxes. You may register with FPS by calling 0843 005 9576 or online at [https://secure.dma.org.uk/cgi-bin/session.pl?reg_option=fps](https://secure.dma.org.uk/cgi-bin/session.pl?reg_option=fps).

### Internet dialler protection

An Internet dialler, which is similar to a computer virus, is software that can be downloaded onto your computer and can connect your computer to Premium Rate Services without your knowledge or consent. To protect your computer, we recommend that you exercise caution when clicking on links or popups and downloading material for unknown sources. For further protection, upon request by phone or e-mail, we can bar access to all or specific Premium Rate Services for content and cost reasons. In addition, we recommend that you download all necessary security software to protect your computer and that you frequently install updates for such software as it becomes available. If you believe you have been victimized by an Internet dialler, please contact us by phone or e-mail.

### PhonepayPlus

All Service Providers must register with PhonepayPlus, which is an independent organization approved by Ofcom. PhonepayPlus regulates Premium Rate Services and investigates complaints filed by consumers. All Service Providers must adhere to the PhonepayPlus Code of Practice, which can be found at [http://www.phonepayplus.org.uk/for-business/code-of-practice](http://www.phonepayplus.org.uk/for-business/code-of-practice). If a Service Provider violates the Code of Practice, PhonepayPlus may:

- Require a party to remedy a breach

- Issue fines

- Bar access to services

### Service provider contact information

To find contact information for a Service Provider, you can use PhonepayPlus' #NumberChecker tool at [http://www.phonepayplus.org.uk/for-consumers/making-an-enquiry/submit-an-online-enquiry](http://www.phonepayplus.org.uk/for-consumers/making-an-enquiry/submit-an-online-enquiry). If you believe that you were wrongfully charged for a Premium Rate Service, you should contact the Service Provider directly.

### Complaints

If you wish to file a complaint about a Service Provider with PhonepayPlus, you may, free of charge, submit an enquiry either online or by phone:

- Phone: 0300 30 300 20 (9:30 am - 5 pm Monday to Friday)

- Online Enquiry: [http://www.phonepayplus.org.uk/for-consumers/making-an-enquiry/submit-an-online-enquiry](http://www.phonepayplus.org.uk/for-consumers/making-an-enquiry/submit-an-online-enquiry)

### Dispute resolution

If you believe that the charge on your Premium Rate Service charge on you bill was an error on Skype for Business' part and you would like a refund, you can file a complaint according to the Skype for Business Complaint Handling Code. If you file a complaint with Skype for Business and either (a) the complaint is not resolved after eight (8) weeks of submission or (b) you receive a letter from us stating that we have reached a final decision, you may refer the complaint to Ombudsman Services, which is a third party approved by Ofcom to deal with complaints regarding communications services.

## 13. National translation services, personal numbers and 0870 numbers

National Translation Services are telephone numbers that begin with 08 or 0500 (Freephone numbers) and are classified as "special service numbers" by the National Telephone Numbering Plan. Personal Numbers are prefixed with the numbers 070.

Rates for National Translation Services, Personal Numbers, and 0870 numbers are provided on our [website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=820709&amp;clcid=0x809) and may fluctuate depending on the time of day and the day of the week that your call is made. Calls to 0800 numbers are free.
