# Auto attendant and call queue dialing and voice recognition reference

Dial by Name is a feature of an auto attendant that is also known as directory search. It enables the people who call your auto attendant to use voice (speech recognition) or their phone keypad (DTMF) responses to enter a full or partial name to search company's directory, locate the person, and then have the call transferred to them. You set up dial by name when you [configure the call flow settings in an auto attendant](create-a-phone-system-auto-attendant.md#call-flow).

## Searching for users

Users you wish to have located and reached using Dial by Name **aren't required to have a phone number or have Calling Plans assigned to them, but they must be Enterprise Voice enabled for Skype for Business Server users**. Dial by Name will even be able to find and transfer calls to Microsoft Teams users who are hosted in different countries or regions for multi-national organizations. Given the prerequisites involved, you explicitly enable Dial by Name in an auto attendant.

Dial by extension is a feature of an auto attendant that is also part of directory search. It enables the people who call your auto attendant to use voice (speech recognition) or their phone keypad (DTMF) responses to enter the phone extension of the user they're trying to reach, and then have the call transferred to them. Users you wish to have located and reached using Dial by extension  **aren't required to have a phone number or have Calling Plans assigned to them, but they must be Enterprise Voice enabled for Skype for Business Server users**. You will also need to have an appropriately configured dial plan for your users. Dial by extension  will even be able to find and transfer calls to Microsoft Teams users who are hosted in different countries or regions for multi-national organizations. Given the prerequisites involved, you explicitly enable Dial by extension in an auto attendant.

### Maximum directory size

There is no limit on the number of Active Directory users  Dial by Name and Dial by Extension can support when a caller search for a specific person. A caller can enter partial or full names (FirstName + LastName, and also LastName + FirstName), but needs the full extension number. The maximum name list size that a single auto attendant can support using speech recognition is 80,000 users.
  
|Input type|Search format|Maximum number of users in an organization|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|DTMF (keypad entry) |Partial  <br/> FirstName + LastName  <br/> LastName + FirstName |No limit  |
|Speech (voice input) |FirstName  <br/> LastName  <br/> FirstName + LastName  <br/> LastName + FirstName  | 80,000 users |

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using Dial by Name with speech recognition, but your organization's Active Directory is larger than 80,000 users and you haven't limited the scope of Dial by Name using Dial Scope feature, Dial by Name will still work for your callers using a phone keypad, and voice inputs will be available for all other scenarios. You can use the Dial Scope feature to narrow down the names that are reachable by changing the scope of Dial by Name for a particular auto attendant.
  
## Dial by Name - Keypad (DTMF) entry
People calling in can use Dial by Name to reach users by specifying either the full or partial name of the person they are trying to reach. There are various formats that can be used when the name is entered.

When searching your organization's directory, people can use the '0' (zero) key to indicate a space between the first name and last or last name and first. When they are entering the name, they will be asked to terminate their keypad entry with the # key. For example, "After you enter the name of the person you are trying to reach, press #." If there are multiple names that are found, the person calling will be given a list of names to select from.
  
People can search for names in your organization using the following search formats on their phone keypad:
  
|Name format|Search type|Example|Search result|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|FirstName + LastName |Full  |Amos0Marble# |Amos Marble |
|LastName + FirstName |Full |Marble0Amos#  |Amos Marble |
|FirstName  |Full   |Amos#   |Press 1 for Amos Marble  <br/> Press 2 for Amos Marcus |
|LastName |Full |Marble#  |Press 1 for Amos Marble  <br/> Press 2 for Mary Marble |
|FirstName or LastName |Partial |Mar# |Press 1 for Mary Marble  <br/> Press 2 for Mary Jones  <br/> Press 3 for Amos Marcus |
|FirsName + LastName |Partial |Amos0Mar# |Press 1 for Amos Marble  <br/> Press 2 for Amos Marcus |
|LastName + FirstName |Partial |Mar0Am# |Press 1 for Amos Marble  <br/> Press 2 for Amos Marcus |

There are several special characters that are used when searching for people using a phone keypad. For example, the person will be asked to use the pound key (#), while the zero (0) key is used for a space between names. Pressing the star key (*) will repeat the list of matching names to the person.
  
|Special phone keypad character|What it means|
|:-----|:-----|
|#   |End character when entering a name. |
|0   |Space between names. |
|*    |Repeat the list of matching names. |

### Dial by Name - Name recognition with speech

People can search for others in their organization with their voice (speech recognition). They can also reach anyone in  Active Directory by saying the full or partial name of the person they are trying to locate. Using voice inputs can recognize names in various formats, including FirstName, LastName, FirstName + LastName, or LastName + FirstName.
  
You can enable speech recognition for an auto attendant, but phone keypad entry (DTMF) isn't disabled. Phone keypad entry can be used at any time even if speech recognition is enabled on the auto attendant.
  
As with phone keypad entry, if multiple names are found, the person calling hears a list of names to select from.
  
Callers can say names in the following formats:
  
|Name with speech|Search type|Example|Search result|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|FirstName + LastName |Full |Amos Marble |Amos Marble |
|LastName + FirstName |Full  |Marble Amos |Amos Marble |
|FirstName |Full |Amos |Press or say 1 for Amos Marble  <br/> Press or say 2 for Amos Jones |
|LastName |Full |Marble |Press or say 1 for Amos Marble  <br/> Press or say 2 for Ben Marble |
|FirstName or LastName |Partial |Mar |Press or say 1 for Mary Marble  <br/> Press or say 2 for Mary Jones  <br/> Press or say 3 for Amos Marcus |
|FirsName + LastName |Partial |Amos Mar |Press or say 1 for Amos Marble  <br/> Press or say 2 for Amos Marcus |


> [!NOTE]
> It might take up to 36 hours for a new user to have their name listed in the directory for Dial by Name with speech recognition due to Active Directory replication lag.
