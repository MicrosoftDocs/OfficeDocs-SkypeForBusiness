# Set up meeting dial-out confirmation for your users in Microsoft Teams

Meeting dial outs and Call me calls are useful ways to invite participants to join a meeting and for existing participants to join a meeting using a traditional or mobile phone. However, when the called person is unable to answer the call and the call is answered by a voicemail system, the voicemail system is connected to the meeting. Participants will be able to listen to it until it’s removed from the meeting.

To prevent voicemail systems from connecting to meetings when a meeting dial out is sent to a phone number and the called person is unable to answer the call, you can set up Teams to request a confirmation from the called person for them to join the meeting. If the called person can’t answer the call and the call is answered by a voicemail system, the voicemail system won‘t be connected to the meeting because it won’t provide a confirmation to join it.

When this capability is enabled, people that receive a dial out or Call me call must confirm that they want to join the meeting by either pressing 1 on their traditional or mobile phone or saying "Okay". The confirmation will prevent the user's voicemail message from joining the meeting.

To enable this capability for all meetings in your organization, set the ```EnableDialOutJoinConfirmation``` parameter of the [Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingTenantSettings](/powershell/module/skype/set-csonlinedialinconferencingtenantsettings?view=skype-ps) cmdlet to ```true```. To set this parameter, run the following command:

```PowerShell
Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingTenantSettings -EnableDialOutJoinConfirmation $true
```
