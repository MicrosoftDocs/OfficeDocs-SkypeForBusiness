# Quick start - Microsoft Teams

To get started quickly on Teams, we recommend you create two or three teams and channels for a select group of early adopters. By first rolling out Teams on a small scale, you'll learn Teams by using Teams and gain valuable insights to inform how you deploy Teams across your whole organization. 

Use Teams to quickly pull together a team with people inside and outside your organization, chat with others to drive fast and inclusive conversations, securely share and coauthor documents, and iterate on projects. Customize Teams by adding fingertip access to shared notes, webpages, and apps. Use meetings and calling to collaborate in real time from wherever users are. Teams will simplify your access to Office 365 services and  third-party apps to be the new center of gravity for your collaboration and communication needs.

Here's how to roll out your first set of teams and channels so your early adopters can start chatting, sharing files, and collaborating.

- Step 1: [Create your first teams and channels](get-started-with-teams-create-your-first-teams-and-channels.md)
- Step 2: [Onboard early adopters](get-started-with-teams-onboard-early-adopters.md)
- Step 3: [Monitor usage and feedback](get-started-with-teams-monitor-usage-and-feedback.md)
- Step 4: [Get resources to plan your organization-wide rollout](get-started-with-teams-resources-for-org-wide-rollout.md)

If you're a large organization, have a hybrid or on-premises Skype for Business configuration, have strict regulatory or compliance requirements, or if you want to roll out meetings or voice features (such as calling plans or phone system), see our [in-depth resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/Microsoft-Teams) to plan for these more complex features. We recommend you still begin with this section to build your skills and plan Teams with Teams. Start small by rolling out Teams with chat, teams, and channels and build from there &ndash; these initial experiences can help spread the word about Teams, generating excitement throughout the organization for your next launch phase. 

## Before you get started

Make sure youâ€™ve got Teams licenses for everybody. Check out [Compare Teams plans](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/free) and [Office 365 licensing for Teams](office-365-licensing.md).
