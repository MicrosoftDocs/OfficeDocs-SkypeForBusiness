# Use guest access and external access to collaborate with people outside your organization

This article describes two of the options for collaborating with people outside your organization:

- **External access** - A type of federation that allows users to find, call, and chat with people in other organizations. These people cannot be added to a team unless they are invited as guests.
- **Guest access** - Guest access allows you to invite people from outside your organization to join a team. Invited people get a guest account in Azure Active Directory.

For a complete overview of the external collaboration in Microsoft 365, see [Overview of external collaboration options in Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/enterprise/external-guest-access).

## External access (external chat and meetings)

Set up external access if you need to find, call, chat, and set up meetings with people outside your organization who use Teams, Skype for Business (online or on premises) or Skype. 

By default, external access is enabled for all domains. You can restrict external access by allowing or blocking specific domains or by turning it off.

To configure external access, see [Manage external access](manage-external-access.md). 

>[!NOTE]
> [Microsoft Teams Free (classic)](https://support.microsoft.com/office/welcome-to-microsoft-teams-free-classic-6d79a648-6913-4696-9237-ed13de64ae3c) licenses do not support external access.

## Guest access

Use guest access to add a person from outside your organization to a team, where they can chat, call, meet, and collaborate on files. A guest can be given nearly all the same Teams capabilities as a native team member. For more information, see [Guest experience in Teams](guest-experience.md).

Guests are added to your organization's Azure Active Directory as B2B users and must sign in to Teams using their guest account. This means that they may have to sign out of their own organization to sign in to your organization.

To configure guest access for Teams, see [Collaborate with guests in a team](/microsoft-365/solutions/collaborate-as-team).

## Compare external and guest access

The following tables show the differences between using external access (federation) and guests. In both cases, people outside your organization are identified to your users as being external.
