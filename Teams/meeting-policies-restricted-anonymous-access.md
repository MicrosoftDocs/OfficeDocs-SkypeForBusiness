# Remove the RestrictedAnonymousAccess Teams meeting policy from users

[Meeting policies](meeting-policies-overview.md) in Microsoft Teams are used to control the features that are available to meeting participants for meetings that are scheduled by users in your organization. 

Teams includes a built-in policy named RestrictedAnonymousAccess, which contains pre-defined settings that include restricting anonymous users from starting a meeting. (Anonymous users are users who haven't been authenticated.) The predefined settings in the meeting policy can't be edited or changed by admins.

This article shows you how to use PowerShell to remove the RestrictedAnonymousAccess meeting policy from users who are assigned this policy. To learn more about how to manage Teams using PowerShell, see [Teams PowerShell overview](teams-powershell-overview.md).

## Before you start

Install and connect to the [Skype for Business PowerShell module](/microsoft-365/enterprise/manage-skype-for-business-online-with-microsoft-365-powershell). For step-by-step guidance, see [Install Microsoft Teams PowerShell](teams-powershell-install.md).

## Get the Teams meeting policy assignments for your organization

Run the following to get the Teams meeting policy assignments for your organization.

```powershell
Get-CsOnlineUser | Select-Object objectid, TeamsMeetingPolicy | Group-Object TeamsMeetingPolicy
```

In this example, the following output is returned, which shows that two users are assigned the RestrictedAnonymousAccess meeting policy.

```console
Count  Name                               Group
------ ----------                         ---------
233    Education_HigherEducationStudent   {@{ObjectId=755e0d21-0737-4219-b68a-23423497f61f; TeamsMeetingPolicy=Education_HigherEducationStudent...
20                                        {@{ObjectId=e27fdfb5-bb38-4032-bb33-8e8bdf086eff; TeamsMeetingPolicy=}, @{ObjectId=91c330...
2      RestrictedAnonymousAccess          {@{ObjectId=38b35ebf-cc8b-4b61-a2db-f6e67c3f614b; TeamsMeetingPolicy=RestrictedAnonymousAccess...
```

## Unassign the RestrictedAnonymous meeting policy from users

To remove the the RestrictedAnonymous meeting policy from users, you can use the [Grant-CSTeamsMeetingPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/grant-csteamsmeetingpolicy) cmdlet if you have a small number of users (for example, less than 100 users). If you have a large number of users (for example, more than 100 users), it's more efficient to use the  [New-CsBatchPolicyAssignmentOperation](/powershell/module/teams/new-csbatchpolicyassignmentoperation) cmdlet to submit a batch operation.

### Use the Grant-CsTeamsMeeting Policy cmdlet

Run the following to remove the RestrictedAnonymous meeting policy from users.

```powershell
Get-CsOnlineUser |? TeamsMeetingPolicy -eq "RestrictedAnonymousAccess" | Select-Object objectid | foreach {Grant-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity $_.ObjectId -PolicyName $null}
```

### Use the New-CsBatchPolicyAssignmentOperation cmdlet

With [batch policy assignment](assign-policies-users-and-groups.md#assign-a-policy-to-a-batch-of-users), the maximum number of users for which you can remove or update policies is 5,000 at a time. For example, if you have more than 5,000 users, you'll need to submit multiple batches. For best results, do not submit multiple batches at a time. Allow batches to complete processing before submitting more batches.

> [!NOTE]
> The [New-CsBatchPolicyAssignmentOperation](/powershell/module/teams/new-csbatchpolicyassignmentoperation) cmdlet is in the Teams PowerShell module. Before you follow these steps, install and connect to the [Teams PowerShell module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MicrosoftTeams). For step-by-step guidance, see [Install Microsoft Teams PowerShell](teams-powershell-install.md).

Run the following commands to remove the RestrictedAnonymousAccess meeting policy from a batch of users.

```powershell
$restrictedAnonymousUsers = @(Get-CsOnlineUser |? TeamsMeetingPolicy -eq "RestrictedAnonymousAccess" | %{ $_.ObjectId })
```

```powershell
New-CsBatchPolicyAssignmentOperation -PolicyType TeamsMeetingPolicy -PolicyName $null -Identity $restrictedAnonymousUsers -OperationName "Batch unassign meeting policy"
```

#### Get the status of the batch assignment

Each batch assignment returns an operation ID, which you can use to track the progress and status of the assignments and identify any failures that might occur. For example, run the following:

```powershell
Get-CsBatchPolicyAssignmentOperation -OperationId 62557b78-e734-42d6-952f-41a454ed6115
```

Make sure the **ErrorCount** is **0** (zero) and **OverallStatus** is **Completed**.
