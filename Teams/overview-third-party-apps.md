# Overview of third-party apps in Microsoft Teams

Many provide apps in Teams store. These apps are created by app developers and Microsoft validates the basic functionality, usability, and basic security of the apps. Only after the validation, Microsoft makes apps available in Teams store. For end-users to benefit from the rich app ecosystem, app governance by admins is a key step. As an admin, set an app governance process that balances wide-ranging app requirements of end-users and limitations of internal IT policies, standards, and risk-profiles.

Third-party apps in Microsoft Teams aren't controlled or owned by Microsoft and aren't governed by the Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement. Your organization's use of each third-party app is subject to that app's terms and conditions and privacy statement. Teams admin center allows you to verify all permissions of an app, privacy statements, and terms of use before you allow its use. As always, you can allow use of an app for a few specific users or all users. For third-party apps, as for custom apps, Microsoft Teams allows admins to allow, disallow, govern, and analyze the use of the apps.

In addition to ensuring that admins have control over third-party apps, Microsoft also ensures that only high quality apps are available in the store. We require all apps to go through a mandatory round of validation by Microsoft that checks for functionality of app, identify of publisher, permissions sought by the app, and compliance, privacy, and data security of data collected by the app. We encourage apps to be a part of an optional compliance program to demonstrate an extra focus on security and compliance with industry standards. Know about these programs in the following articles:
