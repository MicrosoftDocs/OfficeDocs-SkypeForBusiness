# Overview of optional connected experiences in Microsoft Teams

If you have a work or school account, your organization's admin may have provided you with the ability to use one or more cloud-backed services (also referred to as **optional connected experiences**) while using Microsoft Teams, like GIPHY and/or URL Preview service. These cloud-backed services are optional. Whether you use them is up to you. They're offered to you under  terms that differ from the [Microsoft Online Service Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/products), as described separately for each optional service. This article lists our Teams cloud-backed services.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're an admin, see the [Manage privacy controls](/deployoffice/privacy/manage-privacy-controls) article to learn how to give or restrict your users' ability to use optional connected experiences.

## GIPHY

GIPHY is a cloud-backed service that lets you use GIFs in your Teams chats. If you’re in **Teams** > **GIF** > **Search**, the search terms are sent to GIPHY. These experiences, if allowed by your admin and after you choose to use them, are subject to the [GIPHY Privacy Policy](https://support.giphy.com/hc/articles/360032872931-GIPHY-Privacy-Policy) and [Terms of Service](https://support.giphy.com/hc/articles/360020027752-GIPHY-User-Terms-of-Service).

## URL Preview service

The URL Preview service automatically generates a preview snippet and attaches under the snippet the URL when a user sends a URL string. This service will make a request to the service URL as the user is typing the message.
