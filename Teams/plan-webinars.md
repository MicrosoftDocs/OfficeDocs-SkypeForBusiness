# Plan for Teams webinars

**APPLIES TO:** ✖️Meetings ✔️Webinars ✖️Town halls

## Recordings

Webinars can be recorded for both attendees and organizers to watch after the event. As an admin, you can manage which types of webinars can be published. You can decide if:

- Webinar recordings can't be published for any webinars
- Only private webinar recordings can be published. Public webinar recordings can't be published
- All webinar recordings can be published

## Registration

Registration is required for attendees to attend webinars.

As an admin, you can:

- Manage whether organizers can create either private webinars or public and private webinars
- Manage whether organizers can edit email communication templates (with a Teams Premium subscription)
- Manage the types of questions an organizer can require attendees to answer when registering for webinars

## External participants

There are a few key differences between in-org and public webinars.

|Capability|In-org webinar|Public webinar|

## Attendee interaction

Registered attendees join the webinar with their cameras and mics off; webinar organizers choose when to let attendees turn on their cameras or un-mute.

As an admin, you can manage the following features attendees use for interaction during webinars:

- **Chat:** You can set chat to be on for everyone, off for everyone, or on for everyone but anonymous users. When chat is set to **On for everyone**, all meeting and webinar participants can read and write chat messages; the organizer's **Meeting chat** settings control the chat experience.

- **Q&A**: You can manage which organizers can turn on Q&A for meetings and webinars.
- **Reactions and hand raise**: You can manage which organizers have reactions available for attendees to use during their meetings and webinars.

## Premium webinars

- Create a webinar wait list
- Limit the day and time when people can register
- Manage attendees’ view
- Manually approve registrants
