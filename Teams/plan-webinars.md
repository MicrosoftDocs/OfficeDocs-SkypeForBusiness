# Plan for Teams webinars

**APPLIES TO:** ✖️Meetings ✔️Webinars ✖️Town halls

## Turn webinars on or off

Webinars are enabled by default. If you'd like to disable or manage webinars for users in your organization, see [Manage who can schedule webinars](set-up-webinars.md).

## Understand your policies

A combination of admin meeting and event policies with organizer and attendee settings to manage webinars.

If you'd like to get familiar with how policies work for Teams meetings and events, see [Manage meeting and event policies in Microsoft Teams](meeting-policies-overview.md).

For a full list of admin policies and organizer settings for webinars, see the [Webinar control comparison](#webinar-control-comparison) section in this article.

## In-org vs public webinars

There are a few key differences between in-org and public webinars. When managing the event access type for webinars to decide whether organizers can schedule public webinars, consider the information in the following table:

|Capability|In-org webinar|Public webinar|
|:----|:-----:|:-------:|
|Includes guests|✖️|✔️|
|Accessible to members of the organization that created the webinar|✔️|✔️|
|Accessible to anyone with a registration link|✖️|✔️|
|Anonymous users can register|✖️|✔️|
|Attendees type their name on the registration form when registering|✖️|✔️|
|Attendees must reenter their information after selecting the join link|✖️|✔️|
|Attendees have unique join links|✔️|✔️|
|Organizers can decide if attendees with a registration link can bypass the lobby|✔️|✔️|
|Organizers can decide if anyone who can't bypass the lobby is automatically rejected|✔️|✔️|
|Attendees can dial in to join|✖️|✖️|

## Webinar attendee interaction

Registered attendees join the webinar with their cameras and mics off; webinar organizers choose when to let attendees turn on their cameras or unmute.

As an admin, you can manage the following features attendees use for interaction during webinars:

- **Chat:** You can set chat to be on for everyone, off for everyone, or on for everyone but anonymous users. When chat is set to **On for everyone**, all meeting and webinar participants can read and write chat messages; the organizer's **Meeting chat** settings control the chat experience.

- **Q&A**: You can manage which organizers can turn on Q&A for meetings and webinars.
- **Reactions and hand raise**: You can manage which organizers have reactions available for attendees to use during their meetings and webinars.

## Premium webinars

A Teams Premium subscription includes the following features for webinars:

- Create a webinar wait list.
- Limit the day and time when people can register.
- Manage attendees’ view
- Manually approve registrants
- Use RTMP-in
- Send reminder emails to registrants.
- Set up a green room for webinar presenters.
