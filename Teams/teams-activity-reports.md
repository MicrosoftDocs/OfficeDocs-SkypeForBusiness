Use activity reports for Microsoft Teams 
========================================

You can use activity reports in the Microsoft 365 admin center to see how users in your organization are using Microsoft Teams. For example, if some don’t use Microsoft Teams yet, they might not know how to get started or understand how they can use Teams to be more productive and collaborative. Your organization can use the activity reports to decide where to prioritize training and communication efforts.

## How to view the Teams reports in the Reports dashboard

1. In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home), select **Reports** > **Usage**.
 
2. On the **Usage** page, choose **Select a report**, and then under **Microsoft Teams** in the list of reports, choose the report you want to view.

## Teams activity reports that are available

There are currently two activity reports you can view:

- [Microsoft Teams user activity report](#microsoft-teams-user-activity-report) 
- [Microsoft Teams device usage report](#microsoft-teams-device-usage-report) 

### Microsoft Teams user activity report

The Teams user activity report gives you a view of the most common activities that your users perform in Teams. This includes how many people engage in a chat in a channel, how many communicate via private chat message, and how many participate in calls or meetings. You can see this information for your whole organization, as well as for each individual user.

#### Interpret the Microsoft Teams user activity report

You can get a view into Teams user activity by looking at the **Activity** and **Users** charts.
