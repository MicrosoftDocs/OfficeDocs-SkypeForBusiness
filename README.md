# Quick Start

## Contribute using the GitHub website

### NOTE: The following guidance is for Office PowerShell but the same process applies for any Markdown document on GitHub.

1. Open your browser, login to GitHub, and then navigate to https://github.com/microsoftdocs/office-docs-powershell
2. Browse to the file you want to edit. In this example we will edit https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/office-docs-powershell/blob/master/teams/teams-ps/teams/New-Team.md and add a link in the Related Links section.
3. Click the Edit icon which looks like a pencil in the upper right corner.

4. Your browser will then open the file in an edit window. We want to add a link so we scroll down to the Related Links section and add the link in the correct format.

**Note** Since you are likely not a maintainer of the Git repository, GitHub will automatically 'Fork' the project into your personal GitHub account. A fork is just an exact copy of the repository in your own account so that you have total access to make edits. You are now 'editing' a copy of the project in your own GitHub account. You can always find it again by looking at your GitHub Repositories in your GitHub Profile (drop-down from your name in top right).

5. You can click the Preview changes link to see what the changes will look like.

6. Once you are satisified with your work, go to the **Propose file change** area at the bottom of the topic. Enter a title and other description informaton and then click **Propose file change**.
