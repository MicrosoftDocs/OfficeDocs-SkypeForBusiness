|**Method**|**Request URI**|**HTTP Version**|

  content : "{ 'Product' : 'New Product Name'",
  type: "application/json"
}
```

 *content*  JSON formatted data to be stored as the new content of an existing sub-Item. Technically, a repository can store any content of any schema, but when used for Call Quality Dashboard, it should be either a report or a query. *type*  Always specify "application/json" for Call Quality Dashboard.
  
 **Response** - The response includes an HTTP status code and a set of response headers.
  
 **Status Code** - A successful operation returns status code 204 (No Content). If a specified item ID is not found, it returns status code 404 (Not Found).

 **Response Body** - None.
