# CLS Logger for Skype for Business Server 2015
 
**Summary:** Learn how to use the Centralized Logging Service (CLS) Logger in Skype for Business Server 2015.
  
The CLS Logger is a tool that helps you manage logs generated by the Centralized Logging Service.
  
## Prerequisites

To successfully use the CLS Logger, you'll need to make sure that the following are true:
  
- You are using the tool on a computer that is a member of the domain where the Centralized Logging Service (CLS) is running. The tool is not currently supported in Remote PowerShell sessions.
    
- The Default.tmx file from the tracing folder (the folder where tracing data is captured for the CLS) and Snooper must be copied in to the same folder where the CLS Logger tool is installed.
    
## Check the Logging Status of a set of Pools/Computers

Use following commands to check logging status:
  
1. In the "Start/Stop Scenarios" tab, select a grouping of Pools and/or Computers in the Topology tree view.
    
2. Click the Logging Status button.
    
3. View the command output in the PowerShell Command Output area for specifics about the logging status of the selected Pools and/or Computers.
    
## Start an existing scenario

To start an existing scenario:
  
1. In the "Start/Stop Scenarios" tab, select an existing Scenario from the Scenarios drop down menu.
    
2. Select a grouping of Pools and/or Computers in the Topology tree view.
    
3. Click on the Start Scenario button. The user interface will get disabled until the operation completes. This may be slow on large deployments.
    
4. The user interface will be enabled again once the Scenario has been successfully started, the details of the action will also be shown in the PowerShell Command Output area.
    
5. The task may take some time before for the logging to be picked up by CLS before any new data from this scenario.
    
## Stop an existing scenario

To stop an existing scenario:
  
1. In the "Start/Stop Scenarios" tab, select an existing Scenario from the Scenarios drop down menu.
    
2. Select a grouping of Pools and/or Computers in the Topology tree view.
    
3. Click on the Stop Scenario button. The user interface will get disabled until the operation completes. This may be slow on large deployments.
    
4. The user interface will be enabled again once the Scenario has stopped, the details of the action will also be shown in the PowerShell Command Output area.
