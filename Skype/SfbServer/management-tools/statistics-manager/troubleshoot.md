# Troubleshoot Statistics Manager for Skype for Business Server 2015
 
**Summary:** Read this topic to troubleshoot your deployment of Statistics Manager for Skype for Business Server 2015.
  
This topic describes how to troubleshoot your Statistics Manager deployment by describing events you might see in the application event log, and appropriate actions you might take to rectify the event. This topic contains the following sections:
  
- [Agent events](troubleshoot.md#BKMK_Agent)
    
- [Listener events](troubleshoot.md#BKMK_Listener)
    
- [Website issues](troubleshoot.md#BKMK_Website)
    
## Agent events
<a name="BKMK_Agent"> </a>

- **1000** — Unable to setup processor limiter (Job Object) — Unknown reason
    
- **1001** — Process limiting isn't allowed on the process (probably already inside a Job Object)
    
    The Agent runs inside of a Windows Job Object to automatically limit its memory footprint. If the agent will not start and these event entries are present in the event log, the Job Object is not able to be instantiated on the server. To work around this, the upper memory limit can be removed by changing a value in the config file:
    
  ```
  C:\Program Files\Skype for Business Server StatsMan Agent\PerfAgent.exe.config
  ```

    Search for "MaxProcessMemoryMB" and change the value to "0" as shown:
    
  ```
  <setting name="MaxProcessMemoryMB" serializeAs="String"> <value>300</value> </setting>
  ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If this change is made, the Agent will generally still consume \< 100 MB of memory, however it will not be forcefully limited to 300 MB as is the default. If this change is made, we recommend closely monitoring memory usage to ensure the Agent does not consume a large amount of memory on its host machine. 
  
- **2000** — Client initialization failure
    
- **2001**— No connection could be made to the service on any source IP
    
    If the Agent cannot connect to the Listener computer, check the following:
    
1. Ensure the Listener service is running on the Listener computer. If not, ensure Redis is running on that server and then restart the Listener service.
    
    Check the Statistics Manager event log on the Listener computer to ensure there are no issues with the Statistics Manager Listener service itself.
    
2. Use a connectivity tool such as telnet to verify connectivity from the Agent computer to the Listener on the correct port.
    
    If not, make sure the incoming firewall rule is enabled on the Listener computer for the network type that the Listener computer is connected to (private/public/domain). If the Listener computer is not joined to a domain, the network may be listed as public and in that case the firewall rules installed with Statistics Manager will not apply by default.
    
- **4000** — Failure to download Server Info from Listener (unknown reason)
    
  - **4001** — Server Not Found in Listener Topology
    
    This error will occur if the server is successfully connecting to the Listener, but the server was not added to the topology in the Listener's cache. Resolution options:
    
  - Make sure you followed the instructions for importing the topology. See [Import the topology](deploy.md#BKMK_ImportTopology). 
    
  - If the Agent is on a server that is not listed in the topology (for example, the nodes in a SQL AlwaysOn cluster), you will need to add the Agent manually by following the instructions in [Import the topology](deploy.md#BKMK_ImportTopology).
    
  - **4002** — Invalid Listener Password
    
    The encrypted password that the agent is attempting to use does not match the service password on the Listener itself. Uninstall the Agent and re-install it using the correct service password.
    
  - **4003** — Certificate Thumbprint Mismatch
    
    The certificate thumbprint given to the Agent at install time does not match the thumbprint on the certificate the Listener is currently using and therefore the connection will be refused. Uninstall the Agent and re-install it using the correct certificate thumbprint.
    
  - **4004** — Invalid Response or HttpStatusCode
    
    The Listener is not responding with an expected status. 
    
  - If the connection is proxied, check the proxy configuration.
    
  - Check the Listener computer's StatsMan log for issues with its configuration.
    
  - **4005** — Couldn't de-serialize the XML
    
    The server info on the Listener server is corrupt or there may be a version mismatch between the Agent and the Listener computers. Ensure the versions match and check the Listener event log for issues.
    
## Listener events
<a name="BKMK_Listener"> </a>

- **10000** — Startup failure Unknown reason (these are unrecoverable and the service will stop/crash as a result)
    
  - **10001** — Configuration problem
    
    Generally this will occur when the [listener_install_location]\PerfAgentListener.exe.config file has been modified by hand and cannot be read by the application.
    
  - **10002** — HTTP Listener initialization error
    
    This event will generally be logged when the URL ACL has not been set properly during installation or the SSL Cert is invalid. Ensure the certificate in your configuration is valid. If it is, reinstall the Listener according to the instructions in [Deploy Statistics Manager](deploy.md#BKMK_Deploy).
    
  - **10003** — Redis failure
    
  - **10004** — Caching infrastructure failure
    
  - **10007** — Settings (stored in redis)
    
    The Listener could not contact Redis or retrieve well-formed data from the cache and could not start. Ensure the Redis service is started and configured properly on the server.
    
  - **10005** — Server info retrieval/parsing
    
    The topology information in the Redis cache is invalid. First, attempt to restart Redis and the Listener. If the error persists, see [Import the topology](deploy.md#BKMK_ImportTopology) to recreate the topology data.
    
- **10100** — Redis PING outage
    
  - **10101** — Redis PING continued outage (every 60 seconds)
    
  - **30100** — Redis PING outage restored
    
    These will be logged when the Listener cannot connect to Redis. Ensure Redis is started and network connectivity between the Listener and Redis is available.
    
- **10200** — Redis Write outage
    
  - **10201** — Redis Write outage continued (every 60 seconds)
    
  - **30100** — Redis Write outage resolved
    
    These will be logged when the Listener cannot write to the Redis cache. Ensure Redis is started and network connectivity between the Listener and Redis is available.
    
- **30000** — Successfully started
    
    Logged each time the Listener is started.
    
- **22000** — Initialization of Statistics Manager Agent succeeded.
    
- **23000** — Initialization of EventLogQueryManager succeeded (first time or after failing)
    
- **24000** — Initialization of serverinfo succeeded (first time or after failing)
    
- **25000** — Listener is back online after failing to post (or first successful post)
    
- **5000** — Start of listener offline for posting data
    
- **5001** — Listener is still offline for an extended period
    
    These events can be useful for monitoring/alerting/clearing issues.
    
## Website issues
<a name="BKMK_Website"> </a>

- Repetitive login prompts in Chrome - this was a bug that has been resolved in version 1.1. Be sure you have upgraded to the latest version of Statistics Manager if you are seeing repeated login prompts in the Chrome browser. To verify the version of the website you are running:
    
  - In File Explorer, open (default directory)
    
  - Right click on StatsManHubWebSite.dll and view its properties.
    
  - If a computer cannot be found in the KHI Landscape view or the Counter Details view, make sure it is a member of a Site and a Pool. If it is not, it will not appear in those views. For information about defining a site and pool for a server in the topology, see [Import the topology](deploy.md#BKMK_ImportTopology).
    
  - The product version will be shown in the Description details.
