# Install SQL Server Reporting Services in Skype for Business Server 
 
**Summary:** Learn where to go to find information about SQL Server Reporting Services used by Skype for Business Server.
  
Skype for Business Server can use SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) for viewing and monitoring reports. In order to use this functionality you will need to have Reporting Services installed and configured.
  
## Install SQL Server Reporting Services

If you intend to use Skype for Business Server Monitoring Reports (see the next article of this documentation for more information) you must first install SQL Server Reporting Services; Reporting Services can be installed at the same time you install Microsoft SQL Server or any time after SQL Server has been installed. If you have not installed SQL Server, then follow the instructions provided earlier in this documentation. When installing SQL Server, make sure that, on the Feature Selection page, you select Reporting Services. That will install SQL Server Reporting Services.
  
To learn how to install SQL Server Reporting Services, see [SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms159106.aspx).
  
If you have already installed SQL Server but did not install SQL Server Reporting Services you can add that feature by following the appropriate set of instructions for SQL Server Reporting Services.
