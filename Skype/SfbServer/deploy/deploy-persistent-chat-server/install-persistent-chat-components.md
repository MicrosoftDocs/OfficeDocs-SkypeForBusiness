# Install Persistent Chat components in Skype for Business Server 2015
 
**Summary:** Read this topic to learn how to use the Skype for Business Server Deployment Wizard to install Skype for Business Server 2015 components and services.
  
Before you install Persistent Chat components, be sure you have already installed prerequisite hardware and software, and created the appropriate topology to support Persistent Chat Server. For details about planning and requirements, see [Requirements for your Skype for Business environment](../../plan-your-deployment/requirements-for-your-environment/requirements-for-your-environment.md) and [Plan for Persistent Chat Server in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../plan-your-deployment/persistent-chat-server/persistent-chat-server.md). For information about how to update and publish your topology to include Persistent Chat Server, see [Add Persistent Chat Server to your Skype for Business Server 2015 topology](add-persistent-chat-server.md).
  
> [!NOTE] 
> Persistent chat is available in Skype for Business Server 2015 but is no longer supported in Skype for Business Server 2019. The same functionality is available in Teams. For more information, see [Journey from Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/journey-skypeforbusiness-teams). If you need to use Persistent chat, your choices are to either migrate users requiring this functionality to Teams, or to continue using Skype for Business Server 2015.
