# Deploy Persistent Chat Server in Skype for Business Server 2015
 
**Summary:** Read this topic to learn how to deploy Skype for Business Server 2015 Persistent Chat Server.
  
To deploy Persistent Chat Server, you: 
  
- Use Topology Builder to define, or import, and subsequently publish your topology and the components that you want to deploy
    
- Prepare your environment for deploying Persistent Chat Server components
    
- Install and configure Persistent Chat Server components for your deployment
    
Before you deploy Persistent Chat Server, you should read [Plan for Persistent Chat Server in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../plan-your-deployment/persistent-chat-server/persistent-chat-server.md). The planning topics describe hardware and software requirements, possible topologies, and collocation scenarios. 
  
> [!NOTE] 
> Persistent chat is available in Skype for Business Server 2015 but is no longer supported in Skype for Business Server 2019. The same functionality is available in Teams. For more information, see [Getting started with your Microsoft Teams upgrade](/microsoftteams/upgrade-start-here). If you need to use Persistent chat, your choices are to either migrate users requiring this functionality to Teams, or to continue using Skype for Business Server 2015. 

## Deployment checklist

You can deploy Persistent Chat Server after you deploy your initial topology, including at least one Skype for Business Server Front End pool or one Skype for Business Standard Edition Server. The deployment checklist describes the basic steps required to deploy Persistent Chat Server and provides links for more details.
