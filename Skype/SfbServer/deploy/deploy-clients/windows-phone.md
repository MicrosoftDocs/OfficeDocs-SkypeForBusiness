# Install and test Skype for Business for Windows Phone
 
**Summary:** Learn how to install and test Skype for Business on your Windows Phone.
  
The Skype for Business for Windows Phone app brings Skype for Business presence, instant messaging (IM), and voice and video calling to Windows mobile devices. Users with Lync 2013 will either get the updated app automatically or be prompted to update it manually, depending on their user settings. New users can download it from the [Windows Phone Marketplace](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=231901). The Skype for Business for Windows Phone app is only available on Windows Phone 8.1 and later.
  
Before directing users in your organization to download the app, you'll want to run the following tests to make sure it is properly integrated into your environment. 
  
## Install Skype for Business Windows Phone 8.1

1. Browse to [Windows Phone 8 update central](https://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/update-central) to update your phone to Windows Phone 8.1.
    
2. From your phone, go to the **Store**, and search for **Skype for Business**.
    
3. Tap **Install**. 
    
## Sign in to Skype for Business for the first time

1. On the **Start** screen, swipe left to view your installed apps, search for Skype for Business for Windows Phone, and then tap the icon to open the app.
    
2. Enter your sign-in address (for example, user@domain.com) and password, and then tap **Done**.
    
     You may be asked for both a user name and a sign-in address. The user name is what you use to sign in to your organization's network, either user@domain.com or domain\username.
    
3. On the **Customer Experience Improvement Program** screen, tap **Join** to send anonymous data about app issues and usage to Microsoft, or **No thanks** if you prefer not to participate.
    
4. On the **Never Miss Your Work Calls** screen, enter your mobile number with country and region codes. When Skype for Business for Windows Phone can't use a Wi-Fi or cellular data network to make an audio or video call, you'll be automatically called at this number and connected to the audio portion of the call.
    
5. Tap **Next** and review the notification and phonebook access settings:
    
   - **Push notifications** Get an alert when you receive a new IM or call. Normally **On** (recommended).
    
     > [!IMPORTANT]

   - **Allow phonebook access** Search for contacts on your mobile phone when you search for contacts in Skype for Business for Windows Phone.
