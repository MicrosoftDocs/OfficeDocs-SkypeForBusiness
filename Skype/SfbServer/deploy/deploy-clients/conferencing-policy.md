# Conferencing policy for Skype Room System accounts
 
Read this topic to learn how to assign conferencing policies for Skype Room System accounts.
  
## Conferencing policy features

The conferencing policy assigned to the Skype Room System account must have certain characteristics. Most of the time, the Skype Room System client joins a scheduled meeting, and therefore the conferencing policy of the meeting organizer will affect the conference. However, in Skype for Business Server, certain capabilities depend on the participant's configuration. For example, if the participant's policy allows a maximum video resolution of 1080p, the participants will experience this higher resolution video capability in the conference even if the organizer's policy doesn't allow it. The following table describes several such settings which you should be aware of when setting up conferencing policies for Skype Room System accounts in your organization.

|FileTransferBitRateKb  <br/> |5000  <br/> |N/A  <br/> |
|TotalReceiveVideoBitRateKb  <br/> |20000  <br/> |We recommend that you set this as high as possible. The effective bandwidth depends on network conditions at the time of conferences.\*  <br/> |
|EnableMultiViewJoin  <br/> |TRUE  <br/> |Must be TRUE for Skype Room System to ensure multi-view video streams  <br/> |
   
* For information about bandwidth planning, see [Network bandwidth requirements for media traffic](../../plan-your-deployment/network-requirements/network-requirements.md#network-bandwidth-requirements-for-media-traffic).
  
> [!NOTE]
> If the Skype Room System client tries to join a scheduled meeting organized by a user who is homed on a Lync Server 2010 pool, the meeting organizer's conferencing policy could prevent the Skype Room System client from performing collaboration. 
  
## Meeting authentication

Skype Room System prompts users for authentication when they use the meeting join link to join a restricted meeting; for example, a meeting for which meeting lobby options have been configured in Outlook. This setting is always on for customized meetings, and users are always prompted. However, for unrestricted meetings, users can join the meeting without authentication. 
  
The following command enables administrators to require authentication for all meetings, including unrestricted meetings: 
  
```
Set-CsMeetingConfiguration -RequireRoomSystemsAuthorization $TRUE
```

By default, RequireRoomSystemsAuthorization is FALSE.
