# Skype Room System hybrid deployments
 
Read this topic to learn how to deploy Skype Room System in a hybrid environment.
  
## Hybrid deployments

Follow these steps if your topology has Skype for Business Server and Exchange Online, and you want to host the Skype Room System resource mailbox on Exchange Online. This section also covers a hybrid scenario where you have both Exchange Online and Exchange Server deployed.
  
For illustrative purpose, we use LyncSample.com for the on-premises domain and LyncSample.ccstp.net for the online domain.
  
1. Create a resource mailbox in Exchange admin center (LyncSample.ccsctp.net) by connecting to the Exchange Online Management shell as described in Exchange Online Provisioning.
    
   ```
   New-Mailbox -room -name "LRS Test 5" -RoomMailboxPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString <password> -AsPlainText -Force) -EnableRoomMailboxAccount $true 
   ```

    You can verify OWA connectivity using lrstest5@LyncSample.ccsctp.net to log in.
    
2. In the Office 365 Exchange admin center, add an e-mail address lrstest5@LyncSample.com (on-prem domain) and set it as the reply address.
    
3. Create an on-prem Active Directory user lrstest5@LyncSample.com, set the e-mail address to lrstest5@LyncSample.com, and set the target address to lrstest5@LyncSample.com.
    
4. Trigger directory synchronization, and, after synchronization is complete, verify that users merge in AAD and that you are not able to change properties in recipient's resources in the Office365 Exchange admin center.
    
5. Verify OWA connectivity using lrstest5@LyncSample.com. (Earlier, you verified OWA connectivity using the online domain.)
    
    After creating the mailbox, you can use Set-CalendarProcessing on the Exchange Online Management Shell to configure the mailbox. Refer to steps 3 through 6 under Single Forest On-prem Deployments for more details.
    
   > [!NOTE]
   > If you have a hybrid environment with Exchange Server and Exchange Online, go to the Exchange Management Shell and Enable-RemoteMailbox lrstest5@LyncSample.com -RemoteRoutingAddress lrstest5@LyncSample.mail.ccsctp.net -Room. Then trigger Directory Synchronization. 
  
    If you want to host the Skype Room System mailbox in Exchange Online, these Exchange Management Shell steps are not required and you can proceed to step 6.
    
6. Enable the Skype Room System account for Skype for Business by running the following cmdlet on Skype for Business Management Shell:
    
   ```
   Enable-CsMeetingRoom -SipAddress 'sip: lrstest5@LyncSample.com' -RegistrarPool pool1.child.corp.LyncSample.com -Identity lrstest5@LyncSample.com
   Set-CsMeetingRoom -Identity lrstest5@LyncSample.com -EnterpriseVoiceEnabled $true
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> If you have Skype for Business Online instead of Skype for Business Server in the above scenario, then after provisioning the Exchange resource mailbox, provision a Skype for Business account as described in Skype for Business Online Provisioning.
