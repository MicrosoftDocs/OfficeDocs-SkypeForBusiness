# Skype Room System trusted domains
 
Read this topic to learn how to configure trusted domains for Skype Room System and Skype for Business.
  
## Trusted domains

The Skype for Business client displays a dialog box that allows users to accept the certificate from the Skype for Business Server if the SIP domain of the user account signing in is different from the name presented in the Subject or Subject Alt Name on the certificate. If the certificate configured for Skype for Business Server in your organization does not have SIP domain name of Skype Room System account in Subject or Subject Alt Name, you must configure those domains presented on the certificate under the Trusted Domains registry key on the Skype Room System console machine. Your Skype Room System manufacturer-provided Skype Room System Administrator's Guide explains how and where to add trusted domains in the Skype for Business client. 
  
For example, assume the certificates configured on Skype for Business Server have a Subject/Subject Alt Name of "CONTOSO.LOCAL" and one of the SIP domains assigned to a user for the Skype Room System sign-in address is "confrm1@contoso.net." Because contoso.net is not in the certificate, on the Skype Room System machine, you will need to configure "contoso.local" as a trusted domain in the registry, as explained in your Skype Room System manufacturer-provided Skype Room System Administrator's Guide.
