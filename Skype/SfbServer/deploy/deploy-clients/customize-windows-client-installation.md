# Customize Windows client installation in Skype for Business Server
 
**Summary:** Overview of installation methods and tools for Skype for Business.
  
> [!NOTE]
> For installation information about Skype for Business that comes with Office 365, see [Deploy the Skype for Business client in Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/8c563b81-22c9-4024-9efe-9fe28c7bbc96). 
  
Enterprise administrators can customize the Windows Installer-based (.msi) installation of volume licensed versions of Skype for Business by using the methods discussed in this section. Because no single tool provides all customization options, you'll likely use a combination of these methods in your Skype for Business deployment. You might use the tools described in the following sections:
  
- [Use the Office Customization Tool (OCT) in Skype for Business Server](use-the-office-customization-tool-oct.md) to customize setup options and features for Skype for Business and other Office programs.
    
- [Use Config.xml to perform installation tasks in Skype for Business Server](use-config-xml-to-perform-installation-tasks.md) to specify the path of the network installation point and perform silent installation.
    
- [Use Setup command-line options in Skype for Business Server](use-setup-command-line-options.md) to specify the Config.xml file to use during installation.
    
- [Configure client bootstrapping policies in Skype for Business Server](configure-client-bootstrapping-policies.md) by using the Group Policy Object Editor MMC snap-in.
    
There will probably be other options you'll want to configure as you deploy the Office suite of products. The topics in this section give an overview of these customization tools and discuss considerations specific to Skype for Business. Included are links to detailed Office help for each tool.
