# Deploy high availability and disaster recovery
 
Skype for Business Server offers high availability with server pooling, disaster recovery with pool pairing, and several modes of Back End Server high availibility, including AlwaysOn Availability groups, database mirroring, and SQL failover clustering. 
  
High availability refers to making sure that Skype for Business Server services are available even if one or more servers goes down.Disaster recovery refers to keeping services going in the event of a natural or human-caused disaster, and preserving as much data from before the disaster as possible.
  
This section tells how to deploy these features, and also covers what steps you can take for high availability and disaster recovery for some of your other server roles.
