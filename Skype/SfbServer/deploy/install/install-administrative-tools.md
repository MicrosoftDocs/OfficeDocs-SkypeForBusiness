## Install Skype for Business Server administrative tools

The installation media for Skype for Business Server provides a flexible experience. When you first run Setup.exe, the only tools installed are the Skype for Business Server Deployment Wizard and the Skype for Business Server Management Shell. By using these two tools, known as Core Components, you can continue with the installation process, but they do not provide primary functionality for the overall Skype for Business Server environment. The Deployment Wizard launches automatically after you install the Core Components. The section of the Deployment Wizard titled **Install Administrative Tools** installs Skype for Business Server Topology Builder and Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Every Skype for Business Server environment must have at least one server with the administrative tools installed.
