# Deploy the VIS server role in Skype for Business Server
 
**Summary:** Deploy the Video Interop Server (VIS) role in Skype for Business Server.
  
To set up the VIS service on the server just created in Topology Builder, start the Skype for Business Server deployment wizard, press **Install or Update Skype for Business Server System** and follow these steps in the wizard:
  
1.  Select **Install Local Configuration Store**.
    
2. Select **Setup or Remove Skype for Business Server Components**.
    
3. Select **Request, Install or Assign Certificates**.
    
4. Select **Start services**.
    
The software for this service is now installed and running. You may open the Services mmc tool to see if the **Skype for Business Server Video Interop Server** service is running along with other Skype for Business Server services. Next, you must configure the VIS server or pool.
