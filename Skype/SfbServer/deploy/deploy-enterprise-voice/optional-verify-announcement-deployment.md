# (Optional) Verify Announcement deployment in Skype for Business
 
Verifying your deployment of Announcement application in Skype for Business Server Enterprise Voice. This affects how calls to unassigned numbers are handled.
  
After you install and configure Announcement, you need to verify the configuration to make sure that calls to unassigned numbers work as expected. At minimum, verify the following:
  
- Call a number that is valid for your organization but is an unassigned number.
    
- Call the unassigned number and verify that the correct announcement plays.
