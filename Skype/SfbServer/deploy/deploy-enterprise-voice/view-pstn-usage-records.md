# View PSTN usage records in Skype for Business

**Summary:** Learn how to view PSTN usage records by using the Skype for Business Server Control Panel or the Skype for Business Server Management Shell.

A Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) usage record specifies a class of call (such as internal, local, or long distance) that can be made by various users or groups of users in an organization. For details, see [PSTN Usage Records](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/b5f624aa-abe8-455b-a8e3-c228be230463.aspx) in the Planning documentation.

### To view a PSTN usage record by using Skype for Business Server Control Panel

1. Open Skype for Business Server Control Panel.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Voice Routing** and then click **PSTN Usage**.

3. On the **PSTN Usage** page, highlight the PSTN usage record you want to view, click **Edit** and then click **Show details**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > A read-only page of the selected PSTN usage record shows the associated routes and associated voice policies.

### To view PSTN usage information by using Skype for Business Server Management Shell cmdlets

- To view information about all of your PSTN usages, type the following command in the Skype for Business Server Management Shell, and then press ENTER:

  ```
  Get-CsPstnUsage
  ```

    This command returns information similar to the following:

<pre>
  Identity : Global
  Usage    : {Internal, Local, Long Distance}
</pre>
