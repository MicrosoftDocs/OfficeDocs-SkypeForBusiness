# Configure voice mail escape in Skype for Business

**Summary:** Learn how to configure voice mail escape in Skype for Business Server by using the Skype for Business Server Management Shell.

When a user configures simultaneous ringing to a mobile phone, a caller will typically be routed to the user's personal voice mail if the mobile phone is turned off, out of battery power, or out of range. With Skype for Business Server , users can opt to have business-related calls routed to their corporate voice mail system. Specifically, a timer can be configured, and if the call is answered by the carrier's voice mail within the range of time defined, Skype for Business Server will disconnect from the carrier's voice mail system (and the user's personal voice mail), while the user's remaining endpoints in the corporate system continue to ring. This way, the caller is automatically routed to the user's corporate voice mail.

This configuration is performed using the Skype for Business Server Management Shell cmdlet, **Set-CsVoicePolicy**, at the voice policy level, with the following parameters.

### To configure voice mail escape

1. Start the Skype for Business Server Management Shell: Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Skype for Business 2015**, and then click **Skype for Business Server Management Shell**.

2. Specify the following parameters to **Set-CsVoicePolicy**:

   - **EnableVoicemailEscapeTimer** - Enables or disables the escape timer.

   - **PSTNVoicemailEscapeTimer** - Specifies the timeout value in milliseconds. The default value is 1500 milliseconds, and the value can range from 0 milliseconds to 8000 milliseconds.

## Example

```
Set-CsVoicePolicy UserVoicePolicy -EnableVoiceMailEscapeTimer $true - PSTNVoicemailEscapeTimer 2000
Set-CsVoicePolicy -Identity site:SitePolicy -EnableVoiceMailEscapeTimer $true -PSTNVoicemailEscapeTimer 1500
```
