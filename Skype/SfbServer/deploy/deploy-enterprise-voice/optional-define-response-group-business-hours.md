# (Optional) Define Response Group business hours in Skype for Business 
 
Create or modify Response Group business hours, in Skype for Business Server Enterprise Voice.
  
## Defining Business Hours

Business hour settings define when the workflow is available to answer calls and specify the actions to take for calls outside of business hours. Response Group administrators can use the **New-CsRgsHoursOfBusiness** cmdlet to create predefined schedules that you can use for any number of response groups.
  
> [!TIP]
> When you create or modify a workflow, you can specify a custom schedule that applies only to that workflow. For details, see [Designing and creating response group workflows in Skype for Business](designing-and-creating-response-group-workflows.md). 
  
> [!NOTE]
> If a workflow is defined as a Managed workflow, then any user who is assigned the CsResponseGroupManager role can set and modify custom business hours for workflows that they manage. 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use 24-hour notation for the parameters in the following cmdlets (for example, 20:00=8:00 P.M.). 
  
### To create a predefined business hours collection

1. Log on as a member of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group, or as a member of one of the predefined administrative roles that support Response Group.
    
2. Start the Skype for Business Server Management Shell: Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Skype for Business 2015**, and then click **Skype for Business Server Management Shell**.
    
3. For each unique range of hours you want to define, run:
    
   ```
   $x = New-CsRgsTimeRange [-Name <name of time range>] -OpenTime <time when business hours begin> -CloseTime <time when business hours end>
   ```

    To create the business hours collection that uses the ranges you defined, run:
    
   ```
   New-CsRgsHoursOfBusiness -Parent <service where the workflow is hosted> -Name <unique name for collection> [-MondayHours1 <first set of opening and closing times for Monday>] [-MondayHours2 <second set of opening and closing times for Monday>] [-TuesdayHours1 <first set of opening and closing times for Tuesday>] [-TuesdayHours2 <second set of opening and closing times for Tuesday>] [-WednesdayHours1 <first set of opening and closing times for Wednesday>] [-WednesdayHours2 <second set of opening and closing times for Wednesday>] [-ThursdayHours1 <first set of opening and closing times for Thursday>] [-ThursdayHours2 <second set of opening and closing times for Thursday>] [-FridayHours1 <first set of opening and closing times for Friday>] [-FridayHours2 <second set of opening and closing times for Friday>] [-SaturdayHours1 <first set of opening and closing times for Saturday>] [-SaturdayHours2 <second set of opening and closing times for Saturday>] [-SundayHours1 <first set of opening and closing times for Sunday>] [-SundayHours2 <second set of opening and closing times for Sunday>]
   ```

    The following example specifies business hours of 9:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. for weekdays, 8:00 A.M. to 10:00 A.M. and again from 2:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M. for Saturdays, and no business hours for Sundays:
    
   ```
   $a = New-CSRgsTimeRange -Name "Weekday Hours" -OpenTime "9:00" -CloseTime "17:00"
   $b = New-CSRgsTimeRange -Name "Saturday Morning Hours" -OpenTime "8:00" -CloseTime "10:00" 
   $c = New-CSRgsTimeRange -Name "Saturday Afternoon Hours" -OpenTime "14:00" -CloseTime "18:00" 
   New-CsRgsHoursOfBusiness -Parent "ApplicationServer:Redmond.contoso.com" -Name "Help Desk Business Hours" -MondayHours1 $a -TuesdayHours1 $a -WednesdayHours1 $a -ThursdayHours1 $a -FridayHours1 $a -SaturdayHours1 $b -SaturdayHours2 $c
   ```
