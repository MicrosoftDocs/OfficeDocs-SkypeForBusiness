# Verify normalization rules for Call Park in Skype for Business
 
Learn about normalization rules for Call Park in Skype for Business Server Enterprise Voice.
  
Call Park orbits must not be normalized. Check your dial plans to be sure that your orbit numbers are not normalized. If you must create an additional normalization rule to prevent your orbits from being normalized, follow the procedure in [Create or modify a dial plan in Skype for Business Server](dial-plans.md) to define a new normalization rule, so that **Pattern to match** identifies the orbit range and **Translation pattern** is **$1**. For example, if your Call Park orbit range is 7000 - 7999, the **Pattern to match** is **^(7\d{3})$** and **Translation pattern** is **$1**.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure that the default normalization rule in your dial plans does not contain **^(\d\*)**. Otherwise, your Call Park normalization rule will never run.
