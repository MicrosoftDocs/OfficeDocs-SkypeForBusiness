# (Optional) Define Response Group holiday sets in Skype for Business
 
Create or modify Response Group holiday sets, in Skype for Business Server Enterprise Voice.
  
Holiday settings define the days that a response group is closed for business and specify the action to take on those days. A holiday set is the collection of holidays that apply to a response group.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If a workflow is defined as a Managed workflow, then any user is assigned the CsResponseGroupManager role can set and modify holidays for workflows that they manage. 
  
### To create a holiday set

1. Log on as a member of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group, or as a member of one of the predefined administrative roles that support Response Group.
    
2. Start the Skype for Business Server Management Shell: Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Skype for Business 2015**, and then click **Skype for Business Server Management Shell**.
    
3. For each holiday you want to define, run:
    
   ```
   $x = New-CsRgsHoliday [-Name <holiday name>] -StartDate <starting date of holiday> -EndDate <ending date of holiday>
   ```

    To create the holiday set that contains the holidays you defined, run:
    
   ```
   New-CsRgsHolidaySet -Parent <service where the workflow is hosted> -Name <unique name for holiday set> -HolidayList <one or more holidays to be included in the holiday set>
   ```

    The following example shows a holiday set that includes two holidays:
    
   ```
   $a = New-CsRgsHoliday -Name "New Year's Day" -StartDate "1/1/2018 12:00 AM" -EndDate "1/2/2018 12:00 AM" 
   $b = New-CsRgsHoliday -Name "Independence Day" -StartDate "7/4/2018 12:00 AM" -EndDate "7/5/2018 12:00 AM" 
   New-CsRgsHolidaySet -Parent "ApplicationServer:Redmond.contoso.com" -Name "2018 Holidays" -HolidayList ($a, $b)
   ```
