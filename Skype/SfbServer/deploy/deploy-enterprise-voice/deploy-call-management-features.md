# Deploy call management features in Skype for Business
 
Deploying call management features in Skype for Business Server Enterprise Voice.
  
Enterprise Voice call management features control how incoming calls are routed and answered. Skype for Business Server provides the following call management features: 
  
- **Call Park**: Enables voice users to temporarily park a call and then pick it up from the same phone or another phone.
    
- **Group Call Pickup**: Enables users to answer calls made to another user who is assigned to a pickup group by dialing the call pickup group number.
    
- **Response Group**: Routes incoming calls to groups of agents by using hunt groups or interactive voice response (IVR) questions and answers.
    
- **Announcement**: Plays a message for calls made to an unassigned number, or routes the call elsewhere, or both.
    
This section describes how to configure these call management features during an Enterprise Voice deployment.
