# Deploy call admission control in Skype for Business Server
 
Call admission control (CAC) is a solution that determines whether a real-time session can be established based on the available bandwidth to help prevent poor audio/video quality for users on congested networks. For more information, see [Plan for call admission control in Skype for Business Server](../../plan-your-deployment/enterprise-voice-solution/call-admission-control.md).
  
### To deploy Call Admission Control

1.  Gather all of the required information for your enterprise network topology, as described in [Example: Gathering requirements for call admission control in Skype for Business Server](../../plan-your-deployment/enterprise-voice-solution/example-gathering-requirements.md).
    
2. If you have not done so already, you must define network regions and sites, and associate subnets with network sites. For details, see [Deploy network regions, sites and subnets in Skype for Business](deploy-network.md).
    
3. Create bandwidth policy profiles, as detailed in [Create bandwidth policy profiles in Skype for Business Server](create-bandwidth-policy-profiles.md)
    
4. Create network region links, as detailed in [Create network region links in Skype for Business Server](create-network-region-links.md).
    
5. Create network inter-region routes, as detailed in [Create network interregional routes in Skype for Business Server](create-network-interregional-routes.md).
    
6. Create network intersite policies, as detailed in [Create network intersite policies in Skype for Business Server](create-network-intersite-policies.md).
    
7. Enable call admission control, as detailed in [Enable call admission control in Skype for Business Server](enable-call-admission-control.md).
    
8. Check a few final settings, to make sure everything is set up correctly. For details, see [Call admission control deployment: final checklist for Skype for Business Server](final-checklist.md).
