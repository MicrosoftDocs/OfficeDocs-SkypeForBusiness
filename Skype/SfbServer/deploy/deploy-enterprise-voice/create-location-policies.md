# Create location policies in Skype for Business Server

Read this topic to learn how to configure enhanced emergency service (E9-1-1) location policies in Skype for Business Server Enterprise Voice. 

Skype for Business Server uses a location policy to enable Skype for Business clients for E9-1-1 during client registration. A location policy contains the settings that define how E9-1-1 will be implemented. For more information, see [Plan location policies for Skype for Business Server](../../plan-your-deployment/enterprise-voice-solution/location-policies.md).

You define location policies by using the Skype for Business Control Panel or by using the [New-CsLocationPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/new-cslocationpolicy?view=skype-ps) cmdlet.

> [!NOTE]
> Skype for Business Server now supports the configuration of multiple emergency numbers for a client. If you want to configure multiple emergency numbers, you must follow the information in [Plan for multiple emergency numbers in Skype for Business Server](../../plan-your-deployment/enterprise-voice-solution/multiple-emergency-numbers.md) and [Configure multiple emergency numbers in Skype for Business](configure-multiple-emergency-numbers.md). 

You can edit the global location policy and create new tagged location policies. A client obtains a global policy when it is not located within a subnet with an associated location policy, or when the client has not been directly assigned a location policy. Tagged policies are assigned to subnets or users. 

To create a location policy, you must use an account that is a member of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group, or is a member of the CsVoiceAdministrator administrative role, or has equivalent administrator rights and permissions.

For more information, see [Plan location policies for Skype for Business Server](../../plan-your-deployment/enterprise-voice-solution/location-policies.md). Cmdlets in this procedure use a location policy defined using the following values. For a complete description of cmdlet parameters and values, see [New-CsLocationPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/new-cslocationpolicy?view=skype-ps).

### To create location policies

1. Start the Skype for Business Server Management Shell: Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Skype for Business 2015**, and then click **Skype for Business Server Management Shell**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > CsLocationPolicy will fail if the setting for **PstnUsage** is not already in the Global list of PstnUsages.

2. Optionally, run the following cmdlet to edit the global Location Policy:

   ```
   Set-CsLocationPolicy -Identity Global -EnhancedEmergencyServicesEnabled $true -LocationRequired "disclaimer" -EnhancedEmergencyServiceDisclaimer "Your company policy requires you to set a location. If you do not set a location emergency services will not be able to locate you in an emergency. Please set a location." -PstnUsage "emergencyUsage" -EmergencyDialString "911" -ConferenceMode "twoway" -ConferenceUri "sip:+14255550123@litwareinc.com" -EmergencyDialMask "112" NotificationUri "sip:security@litwareinc.com" -UseLocationForE911Only $true -LocationRefreshInterval 2
   ```

3. Run the following to create a tagged Location Policy.

   ```
   New-CsLocationPolicy -Identity Tag:Redmond - EnhancedEmergencyServicesEnabled $true -LocationRequired "disclaimer" -EnhancedEmergencyServiceDisclaimer "Your company policy requires you to set a location. If you do not set a location emergency services will not be able to locate you in an emergency. Please set a location." -UseLocationForE911Only $false -PstnUsage "EmergencyUsage" -EmergencyDialString "911" -EmergencyDialMask "112" -NotificationUri "sip:security@litwareinc.com" -ConferenceUri "sip:+14255550123@litwareinc.com" -ConferenceMode "twoway" -LocationRefreshInterval 2
   ```

4. Run the following cmdlet to apply the tagged Location Policy created in step 3 to a user policy.

   ```
   (Get-CsUser | where { $_.Name -match "UserName" }) | Grant-CsLocationPolicy -PolicyName Redmond
   ```
