# Configure the location database in Skype for Business Server
 
Configure, populate, and publish the E9-1-1 location database in Skype for Business Server Enterprise Voice. 
  
To enable clients to automatically detect their location within a network, you first need to configure the location database. 
  
To configure the location database, perform the following tasks:
  
- Populate the database with a mapping of network elements to locations. If you use an Emergency Location Identification Number (ELIN) gateway, you need to include the ELIN in the \<CompanyName\> field.
    
    If you do not populate the location database, and the **Location Required** in the Location Policy is set to **Yes** or **Disclaimer**, the client will prompt the user to enter a location manually.
    
- Validate the addresses against the master street address guide (MSAG) that is maintained by the E9-1-1 service provider.
    
- Publish the updated database.
    
## Populate the location database

To automatically locate clients within a network, you first need to populate the location database with a network wiremap, which maps network elements to civic (that is, street) addresses. You can use subnets, wireless access points, switches, and ports to define the wiremap.
  
You can add addresses to the location database individually, or in bulk by using a CSV file that contains the column formats described in the following table.
  
If you use an Emergency Location Identification Number (ELIN) gateway, include the ELIN in the **CompanyName** field for each location. You can include multiple ELINs for each location, each separated by a semicolon.
  
|**Network Element**|**Required Columns**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Wireless access point** <br/> |\<BSSID\>,\<Description\>,\<Location\>,\<CompanyName\>,\<HouseNumber\>,\<HouseNumberSuffix\>,\<PreDirectional\>,…  <br/> …\<StreetName\>,\<StreetSuffix\>,\<PostDirectional\>,\<City\>,\<State\>,\<PostalCode\>,\<Country\>  <br/> |
|**Subnet** <br/> |\<Subnet\>,\<Description\>,\<Location\>,\<CompanyName\>,\<HouseNumber\>,\<HouseNumberSuffix\>,\<PreDirectional\>,…  <br/> …\<StreetName\>,\<StreetSuffix\>,\<PostDirectional\>,\<City\>,\<State\>,\<PostalCode\>,\<Country\>  <br/> |
|**Port** <br/> |\<ChassisID\>,\<PortIDSubType\>,\<PortID\>,\<Description\>,\<Location\>,\<CompanyName\>,\<HouseNumber\>,\<HouseNumberSuffix\>,…  <br/> …\<PreDirectional\>,\<StreetName\>,\<StreetSuffix\>,\<PostDirectional\>,\<City\>,\<State\>,\<PostalCode\>,\<Country\>  <br/> |
|**Switch** <br/> |\<ChassisID\>,\<Description\>,\<Location\>,\<CompanyName\>,\<HouseNumber\>,\<HouseNumberSuffix\>,\<PreDirectional\>,…  <br/> …\<StreetName\>,\<StreetSuffix\>,\<PostDirectional\>,\<City\>,\<State\>,\<PostalCode\>,\<Country\>  <br/> |
   
### To add network elements to the location database

1. Run the following cmdlet to add a subnet location to the location database.
    
   ```
   Set-CsLisSubnet -Subnet 157.56.66.0 -Description "Subnet 1" -Location Location1 -CompanyName "Litware" -HouseNumber 1234 -HouseNumberSuffix "" -PreDirectional "" -StreetName 163rd -StreetSuffix Ave -PostDirectional NE -City Redmond -State WA -PostalCode 99123 -Country US
   ```

    For ELIN gateways, put the ELIN in the CompanyName field. You can include more than one ELIN. For example:
    
   ```
   Set-CsLisSubnet -Subnet 157.56.66.0 -Description "Subnet 1" -Location Location1 -CompanyName 425-555-0100; 425-555-0200; 425-555-0300 -HouseNumber 1234 -HouseNumberSuffix "" -PreDirectional "" -StreetName 163rd -StreetSuffix Ave -PostDirectional NE -City Redmond -State WA -PostalCode 99123 -Country US
   ```

    Alternately, you can run the following cmdlets and use a file named "subnets.csv" to bulk update subnet locations.
    
   ```
   $g = Import-Csv subnets.csv
   $g | Set-CsLisSubnet
   ```

2. Run the following cmdlet to add wireless locations to the location database.
    
   ```
   Set-CsLisWirelessAccessPoint -BSSID 0A-23-CD-16-AA-2E -Description "Wireless1" -Location Location2 -CompanyName "Litware" -HouseNumber 2345 -HouseNumberSuffix "" -PreDirectional "" -StreetName 163rd -StreetSuffix Ave -PostDirectional NE -City Bellevue -State WA -PostalCode 99234 -Country US
   ```

   Alternately, you can run the following cmdlets and use a file named "waps.csv" to bulk update wireless locations.
    
   ```
   $g = Import-Csv waps.csv
   $g | Set-CsLisWirelessAccessPoint
   ```

3. Run the following cmdlet to add switch locations to the location database.
    
   ```
   Set-CsLisSwitch-ChassisID 0B-23-CD-16-AA-BB -Description "Switch1" -Location Location1 -CompanyName "Litware" -HouseNumber 1234 -HouseNumberSuffix "" -PreDirectional "" -StreetName 163rd -StreetSuffix Ave -PostDirectional NE -City Redmond -State WA -PostalCode 99123 -Country US
   ```

   Alternately, you can run the following cmdlets and use a file named "switches.csv" to bulk update switch locations.
    
   ```
   $g = Import-Csv switches.csv
   $g | Set-CsLisSwitch
   ```

4. Run the following cmdlet to add port locations to the location database
    
   ```
   Set-CsLisPort -ChassisID 0C-23-CD-16-AA-CC -PortID 0A-abcd -Description "Port1" -Location Location2 -CompanyName "Litware" -HouseNumber 2345 -HouseNumberSuffix "" -PreDirectional "" -StreetName 163rd -StreetSuffix Ave -PostDirectional NE -City Bellevue -State WA -PostalCode 99234 -Country US
   ```

   The default for PortIDSubType is LocallyAssigned. You can also set it to InterfaceAlias or InterfaceName
    
   Alternately, you can run the following cmdlets and use a file named "ports.csv" to bulk update port locations.
    
   ```
   $g = Import-Csv ports.csv
   $g | Set-CsLisPort
   ```

## Validate addresses

### To validate addresses located in the location database

1.  Start the Skype for Business Server Management Shell: Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Skype for Business 2015**, and then click **Skype for Business Server Management Shell**.
    
2. Run the following cmdlets to configure the emergency service provider connection.
    
   ```
   $pwd = Read-Host -AsSecureString <password>
   Set-CsLisServiceProvider -ServiceProviderName Provider1 -ValidationServiceUrl <URL provided by provider> -CertFileName <location of certificate provided by provider> -Password $pwd
   ```

3. Run the following cmdlet to validate the addresses in the location database.
    
   ```
   Get-CsLisCivicAddress | Test-CsLisCivicAddress -UpdateValidationStatus
   ```

   You can also use the **Test-CsLisCivicAddress** cmdlet to validate individual addresses.
    
## Publish the location database

The new locations that you added to the location database will not be made available to the client until they have been published.
  
If you use Emergency Location Identification Number (ELIN) gateways, you also need to upload the ELINs to your public switched telephone network (PSTN) carrier's Automatic Location Identification (ALI) database. Your PSTN carrier may require you to use a specific format for the ELIN records. Contact your PSTN carrier for details. You can export the records from the Location Information service database and format them as required.
  
### To publish the location database

-  Start the Skype for Business Server Management Shell: Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Skype for Business 2015**, and then click **Skype for Business Server Management Shell**.
    
- Run the following cmdlet to publish the location database.
    
  ```
  Publish-CsLisConfiguration
  ```
