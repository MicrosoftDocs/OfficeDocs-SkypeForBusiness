# Export or import a voice route configuration file in Skype for Business
 
**Summary:** Learn how to export or import a voice routing configuration file in Skype for Business Server by using the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
  
If you want to save your voice routing configuration without publishing it, follow these steps to save and retrieve a snapshot of your voice routing configuration. 
  
When you import a voice routing configuration file (.vcfg), but changes have been made to the voice routing configuration on the server in the meantime, the pages in the **Voice Routing** group in Skype for Business Server Control Panel will indicate that there are uncommitted changes to voice routing. Those uncommitted changes are the differences between the two configurations that require reconciliation.
  
If you have made any uncommitted changes to the settings on any page within the group, the changes are saved in the exported voice configuration file (.vcfg). This enables you to make voice routing configuration changes during multiple sessions before you publish the changes. 
  
### To export a voice routing configuration

1. Log on to the computer as a member of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group, or as a member of the **CsVoiceAdministrator**, **CsServerAdministrator**, or **CsAdministrator** administrative role.
    
2. Open Skype for Business Server Control Panel.
    
3. In the left navigation bar, click **Voice Routing**.
    
4. On the **Actions** menu, click **Export configuration**.
    
5. Specify a location and file name, and then click **Save**.
