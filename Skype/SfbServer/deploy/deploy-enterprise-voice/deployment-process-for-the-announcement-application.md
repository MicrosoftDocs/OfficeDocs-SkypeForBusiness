# Deployment process for the Announcement application in Skype for Business Server
 
Deployment process and steps for Announcement application in Skype for Business Server Enterprise Voice.
  
The Announcement application is an Enterprise Voice feature that enables you to configure what happens to calls to unassigned extensions (extensions that are valid for your organization, but are not assigned to a person or a phone). For example, you can configure calls to unassigned numbers to play a message, or to be transferred to a different destination, or both.
  
The Announcement application is installed as a feature of Response Group application on the Front End Server or Standard Edition server when you deploy Enterprise Voice. You need to configure Announcements by uploading your audio files or by configuring text-to-speech (TTS) and configuring the unassigned number table.
  
This section provides an overview of the steps involved in deploying the Announcement application. You must deploy Enterprise Voice before you configure announcements. The components required by the Announcement application are installed and enabled when you deploy Enterprise Voice.
