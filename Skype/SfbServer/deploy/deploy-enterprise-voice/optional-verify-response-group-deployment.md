# (Optional) Verify Response Group deployment in Skype for Business
 
Verify your Response Group deployment success, in Skype for Business Server Enterprise Voice.
  
After you configure Response Group, you need to verify the configuration to make sure your response groups work as expected. At minimum, verify the following scenarios by using the following types of users:
  
 **Users**
  
- A user who is homed on Skype for Business
    
- An external user who uses the public switched telephone network (PSTN)
    
- An agent who is homed on Skype for Business
    
  **Scenarios**
  
- The Skype for Business user calls the response group.
    
- The external user calls the response group.
    
- A user calls the response group while the agent is on another call and goes to the queue.

    > [!NOTE]
