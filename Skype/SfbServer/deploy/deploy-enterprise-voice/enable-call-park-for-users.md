# Enable Call Park for users in Skype for Business
 
Enable users for Call Park in Skype for Business Server Enterprise Voice.

You can enable Call Park at the global scope, or at the site scope or user scope. User scope takes precedence over site scope, and site scope takes precedence over global scope. If you have multiple voice policies, review all the policies to enable Call Park, not just the global policy.
