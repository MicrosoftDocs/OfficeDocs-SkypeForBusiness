## Removing PIN Policies by Using Windows PowerShell Cmdlets

You can delete PIN policies by using Windows PowerShell and the Remove-CsPinPolicy cmdlet. You can run this cmdlet either from the Skype for Business Server Management Shell or from a remote session of Windows PowerShell.

The process is the same in Skype for Business Server.
