## Locking and Unlocking User PINs by Using Windows PowerShell Cmdlets

You can lock and unlock user PINs by using Windows PowerShell and the Lock-CsClientPin and Unlock-CsClientPin cmdlets. You can run these cmdlets either from the Skype for Business Server Management Shell or from a remote session of Windows PowerShell. For details about using remote Windows PowerShell to connect to Skype for Business Server, see the blog article ["Quick Start: Managing Microsoft Lync Server 2010 Using Remote PowerShell"](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=255876). The process is the same in Skype for Business Server.
  
### To lock a user PIN

- To lock a user's PIN, use the Lock-CsClientPin cmdlet. For example:
    
  ```
  Lock-CsClientPin -Identity "Ken Myer"
  ```

### To unlock a user PIN

- To unlock a user's PIN, use the Unlock-CsClientPin cmdlet. For example:
    
  ```
  Unlock-CsClientPin -Identity "Ken Myer"
  ```
