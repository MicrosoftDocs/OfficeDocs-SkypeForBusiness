# Monitor, start, and stop the Persistent Chat services in Skype for Business Server 2015
 
**Summary:** Learn how to start, stop, and monitor the Persistent Chat services in Skype for Business Server 2015.
  
The Persistent Chat services and Persistent Chat Compliance services are part of the Skype for Business Server topology and can therefore be monitored, stopped, and started by using the following cmdlets:
  
|||
|:-----|:-----|
|get-CsWindowsService  <br/> |Returns detailed information about Skype for Business Server 2015 components that run as Windows services.  <br/> |
|start-CsWindowsService  <br/> |Starts the service.  <br/> |
|stop-CsWindowsService  <br/> |Stops the service.  <br/> |
   
> [!NOTE]
> Persistent chat is available in Skype for Business Server 2015 but is no longer supported in Skype for Business Server 2019. The same functionality is available in Teams. For more information, see [Journey from Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/journey-skypeforbusiness-teams). If you need to use Persistent chat, your choices are to either migrate users requiring this functionality to Teams, or to continue using Skype for Business Server 2015. 

For detailed information about how to use the cmdlets, see [Skype for Business Server 2015 Management Shell](../management-shell.md).
