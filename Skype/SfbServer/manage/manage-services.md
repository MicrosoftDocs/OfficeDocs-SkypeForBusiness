### To view a list of computers running Skype for Business Server

1. From a user account that is assigned to any of the predefined administrative roles for Skype for Business Server, log on to any computer in your internal deployment. For details about the predefined administrative roles available in Skype for Business Server, see **Planning for Role-Based Access Control**.   
2. Open a browser window, and then enter the Admin URL to open the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.   
3. In the left navigation bar, click **Topology** and then click **Status**.

   - Sort the list by clicking the **Computer**, **Pool**, or **Site** column heading, and then clicking the up arrow or the down arrow. 
   - Click **Refresh** to view the most up-to-date list.

You can use Skype for Business Server Control Panel to view all the services that are running on a specific computer in your Skype for Business Server topology and see the status of each service.
  
### To view the status of services running on a computer

1. From a user account that is assigned to the CsUserAdministrator role or the CsAdministrator role, log on to any computer in your internal deployment.
2. Open a browser window, and then enter the Admin URL to open the Skype for Business Server Control Panel. 
3. In the left navigation bar, click **Topology**.

   - To see a list of specific services running on the computer and the status of each service, click **Properties**, and then click **Close** to return to the list.
    
### Viewing service status with Windows Powershell cmdlets

You can also view service status by using Windows PowerShell and the **Get-CsWindowsService** cmdlet. You can run this cmdlet from the Skype for Business Server Management Shell or from a remote session of Windows PowerShell. For details about using remote Windows PowerShell to connect to Skype for Business Server, see the blog article ["Quick Start: Managing Microsoft Lync Server 2010 Using Remote PowerShell"](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=255876). The process is the same in Skype for Business Server.
  
### To view service status

To view service status on a computer, type a command similar to the following in the Skype for Business Server Management Shell and then press Enter:
  
```
Get-CsWindowsService -ComputerName atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com | Select-Object RoleName, Status
```

This command returns information similar to the following:
  
|**RoleName**|**Status**|
|:-----|:-----|
|{W3SVC}  <br/> |Running  <br/> |
|{CentralManagement}  <br/> | Running <br/> |
|{ClsAgent}  <br/> |Running  <br/> |
|{Registrar, UserServer, EdgeServer}  <br/> |Running  <br/> |
|{ApplicationServer}  <br/> |Running  <br/> |
|{ConferencingServer}  <br/> |Running  <br/> |
|{MediationServer}  <br/> |Running  <br/> |
