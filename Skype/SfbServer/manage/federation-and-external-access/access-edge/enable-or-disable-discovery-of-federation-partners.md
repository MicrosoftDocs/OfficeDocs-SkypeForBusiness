# Enable or disable discovery of federation partners in Skype for Business Server

At the time you deployed your Edge Servers and enabled federation for your organization, you should have specified whether to support automatic discovery of federated partner domains. Use the procedure in this topic to change that configuration.

> [!NOTE]  
> The following procedure assumes that you have already enabled federation for your organization. For details about enabling federation, see [Enable or disable remote user access](enable-or-disable-remote-user-access.md).

## To enable or disable automatic discovery of federated domains for your organization

1.  From a user account that is a member of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group (or has equivalent user rights), or is assigned to the CsAdministrator role, log on to any computer in your internal deployment.

2.  Open a browser window, and then enter the Admin URL to open the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.

3.  In the left navigation bar, click **External User Access**, click **Access Edge Configuration**.

4.  On the **Access Edge Configuration** page, click **Global**, click **Edit**, and then click **Show details**.

5.  In **Edit Access Edge Configuration**, under **Enable communications with federated users**, select or clear the **Enable partner domain discovery** check box to enable or disable automatic discovery of partner domains.

6.  Click **Commit**.

To enable federated users to collaborate with users in your Skype for Business Server deployment, you must have also configured at least one external access policy to support federated user access. For details, see [Enable or disable federation and public IM connectivity](enable-or-disable-federation-and-public-im-connectivity.md). For details about controlling access for specific federated domains, see [Manage SIP federated domains](../sip-domains/manage-sip-federated-domains-for-your-organization.md) and [Manage SIP federated providers](../sip-providers/manage-sip-federated-providers-for-your-organization.md).


## Enabling or disabling discovery of federation partners by using Windows PowerShell cmdlets

Discovery of federation partners can be managed by using Windows PowerShell and the Set-CsAccessEdgeConfiguration cmdlet. This cmdlet can be run either from the Skype for Business Server Management Shell or from a remote session of Windows PowerShell. 


## To enable discovery of federation partners

  - To enable discovery of federation partners, set the value of the **EnablePartnerDiscovery** property to True ($True). Note that you must enable DNS SRV routing in order to change this property value.
    
        Set-CsAccessEdgeConfiguration -UseDnsSrvRouting -EnablePartnerDiscovery $True


## To disable discovery of federation partners

  - To disable discovery of federation partners, set the value of the **EnablePartnerDiscovery** property to False ($False):
    
        Set-CsAccessEdgeConfiguration -UseDnsSrvRouting -EnablePartnerDiscovery $False
