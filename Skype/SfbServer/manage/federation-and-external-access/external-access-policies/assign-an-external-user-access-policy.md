# Assign an external user access policy to a Skype for Business enabled user

If a user has been enabled for Skype for Business Server, you can configure SIP federation, remote user access, and public instant messaging (IM) connectivity in the Skype for Business Server Control Panel by applying the appropriate policies to specific users. For example, if you created a policy to support remote user access, you must apply it to the user before the user can connect to Skype for Business Server from a remote location and collaborate with internal users from the remote location.


> [!NOTE]  
> To support external user access, you must enable support for each type of external user access you want to support, and configure the appropriate policies and other options to control its use. For details, see [Managing federation and external access to Skype for Business Server](../managing-federation-and-external-access.md).


Use the procedure in this topic to apply a previously created external user access policy to one or more user accounts.


## To apply an external user policy to a user account

1.  From a user account that is assigned to the CsUserAdministrator role or the CsAdministrator role, log on to any computer in your internal deployment.

2.  Open a browser window, and then enter the Admin URL to open the Skype for Business Server Control Panel. 

3.  In the left navigation bar, click **Users**, and then search on the user account that you want to configure.

4.  In the table that lists the search results, click the user account, click **Edit**, and then click **Show details**.

5.  In **Edit Skype for Business Server User** under **External access policy**, select the user policy that you want to apply.
     
> [!NOTE]  
> The **\<Automatic>** settings apply the default server or global policy settings.


## Assigning Per-User External Access Policies by Using Windows PowerShell Cmdlets

Per-user external access policies can be assigned by using Windows PowerShell and the Grant-CsExternalAccessPolicy cmdlet. This cmdlet can be run either from the Skype for Business Server Management Shell or from a remote session of Windows PowerShell. 

## To assign a per-user external access policy to a single user

  - This command assigns the per-user external access policy RedmondExternalAccessPolicy to the user Ken Myer.
    
        Grant-CsExternalAccessPolicy -Identity "Ken Myer" -PolicyName "RedmondExternalAccessPolicy"


## To assign a per-user external access policy to multiple users

  - This command assigns the per-user external access policy USAExternalAccessPolicy to all the users who have accounts in the UnitedStates OU in Active Directory. For more information on the OU parameter used in this command, see the documentation for the [Get-CsUser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/skype/Get-CsUser) cmdlet.
    
        Get-CsUser -OU "ou=UnitedStates,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" | Grant-CsExternalAccessPolicy -PolicyName "USAExternalAccessPolicy"


## To unassign a per-user external access policy

  - This command unassigns any per-user external access policy previously assigned to Ken Myer. After the per-user policy is unassigned, Ken Myer will automatically be managed by using the global policy or, if one exists, his local site policy. A site policy takes precedence over the global policy.
    
        Grant-CsExternalAccessPolicy -Identity "Ken Myer" -PolicyName $Null



For more information, see the help topic for the [Grant-CsExternalAccessPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/skype/Grant-CsExternalAccessPolicy) cmdlet.
