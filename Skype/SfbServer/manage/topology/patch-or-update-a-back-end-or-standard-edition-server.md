# Patch or update a Back End Server or Standard Edition server in Skype for Business Server
 
**Summary:** Learn how to install an update or patch on a Back End Server in Skype for Business Server.
  
This topic explains how to install an update on an Enterprise Edition Back End Server or a Standard Edition server.
  
If a Back End Server is down for at least 30 minutes while you are upgrading it, users may then go into resiliency mode. When the upgrade is finished and the Back End Servers has again connected with the Front End Servers in the pool, users are returned to full functionality. If the upgrade takes less than 30 minutes, users will not be affected.

2. Download the update and extract it to the local hard disk.
