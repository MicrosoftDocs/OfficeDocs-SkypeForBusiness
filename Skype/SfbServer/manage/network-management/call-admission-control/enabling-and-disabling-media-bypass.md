# Enabling and disabling media bypass in Skype for Business Server

Use the procedures in this article to enable or disable media bypass by using the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.

## Enable network media bypass 

Media bypass settings apply globally across a Skype for Business Server deployment. Media bypass allows calls to bypass the Mediation Server. For details about when to use Media bypass, see [Plan for media bypass](../../../plan-your-deployment/enterprise-voice-solution/media-bypass.md).

You can enable and configure media bypass from the Skype for Business Server Control Panel.


### To enable and configure media bypass

1.  From a user account that is a member of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group (or has equivalent user rights), or is assigned to the CsAdministrator role, log on to any computer in your internal deployment.

2.  Open a browser window, and then enter the Admin URL to open the Skype for Business Server Control Panel. 

3.  In the left navigation bar, click **Network Configuration**, and then click **Global**.

4.  On the **Global** page, click the **Global** configuration. There is always only one configuration, and it is always named Global.

5.  On the **Edit** menu, click **View details**.

6.  On the **Edit Global Setting** page, click the **Enable media bypass** check box.

7.  Select one of the following options:
    
      - **Always bypass**   Select this option to attempt media bypass on all calls. This option will be unavailable if call admission control (CAC) is enabled. If CAC is not enabled, select this option in the following situations:
        
          - There is no need for bandwidth control.
        
          - There is no need for fine-grained configuration to determine when bypass should happen.
        
          - There is full connectivity between gateways and clients.
    
      - **Use sites and region configuration**   If CAC is enabled, this option is selected by default and cannot be changed. When this option is selected, network configuration sites and regions will be used to determine when media bypass is possible. If you select this option, you can choose to enable bypass for sites that are not mapped. Click the **Enable bypass for non-mapped sites** check box only if you have one or more large sites associated with the same region that do not have bandwidth constraints (for example, a large central site) and you also have some branch sites associated with the same region that do have bandwidth constraints. When you enable bypass for non-mapped sites, configuration is streamlined because you specify only the subnets associated with the branch sites rather than needing to specify all subnets associated with all sites. We recommend that you do not select the **Enable bypass for non-mapped sites** check box if CAC is enabled.
