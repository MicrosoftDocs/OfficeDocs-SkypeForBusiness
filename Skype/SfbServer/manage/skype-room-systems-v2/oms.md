# Manage Skype Room Systems v2 devices with OMS

This article discusses how to manage Skype Room Systems v2 devices in an integrated, end-to-end manner using Microsoft Operations Management Suite. 

You can configure Microsoft Operations Management Suite (OMS) to provide basic telemetry that will help you manage Skype meeting room devices (see [Plan Skype Room Systems v2 management with OMS](../../plan-your-deployment/clients-and-devices/oms-management.md) and [Deploy Skype Room Systems v2 management with OMS](../../deploy/deploy-clients/with-oms.md) for details). As your management solution matures, you can purchase additional data and management capabilities to create a more detailed view of device performance.

## Understand the log entries
<a name="Telemetry"> </a>

The following event descriptions are inserted into the event log description field every five minutes, when the SRS app records the corresponding information in the Windows event log. The OMS agent passes these reports to OMS, which parses them into the dashboard you created in [Deploy Skype Room Systems v2 management with OMS](../../deploy/deploy-clients/with-oms.md). Using the dashboard you can look at individual log entries to determine courses of action if needed. 

Event IDs 2000 and 3000 indicate the device in question is working as expected. Event IDs 2001 and 3001 indicate an issue was found. Event ID 4000 may require action if it is seen more often than you expect, compared to a baseline you set or other deployed devices in your organization.

Understanding these event descriptions alerts you to problems quickly, and provides a starting point for further troubleshooting.


| Event ID level                 | Event behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Event Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 2001  <br/> Error  <br/>       | This is an app error event. Every 5 minutes, SRS v2 checks that it is signed in to Skype for Business with network and Exchange connectivity. If one or more factors are not true, it will write EventID 2001 into the event log every 5 minutes until the device is offline or all of the conditions are able to be met once again.  <br/>                                                                                              | {"Description":"Network status : Healthy. <br/> Exchange status : Connected. **Signin status: Unhealthy.** ",<br/> "ResourceState":"Unhealthy","OperationName":"Heartbeat",<br/> "OperationResult":"Fail","OS":"Windows 10", <br/> "OSVersion":"10.0.14393.693", "Alias":"",<br/> "DisplayName":"Display Name", "AppVersion":"1.0.38.0",<br/>  "IPv4Address":"10.10.10.10","IPv6Address":"ip v6 address"} <br/><br/>  In this example, the SRSv2 determined that the network connection was healthy and the app was connected to Exchange, but the bolded portion indicates the app is not connected to Skype for Business. This could be a configuration issue on the device or host.  <br/> <br/> The Network status will show as either Healthy or Unhealthy. If the status is unhealthy, you may have a network issue or the device may have been unplugged (but then you would probably also have Exchange and Skype for Business errors).  <br/> <br/> The Exchange Status will show as either Connected or one of the following: Disconnected, Connecting, AutodiscoveryError (the most commonly seen error), GeneralError, or ServerVersionNotSupported. If the status is Connecting, wait until the next health message is sent, for other errors refer the issue to an admin with experience in solving Exchange issues.  <br/><br/>  The Signin status (indicating the app is signed in to Skype for Business) will show as either Healthy or Unhealthy. If the status is unhealthy, send a technician to investigate further.  <br/> |
| 3000  <br/> Information  <br/> | This event verifies that a hardware check was run and found to be healthy. Every 5 minutes SRS v2 checks that configured hardware components such as front of room display, microphone, speaker, and camera are connected and functioning. If all components are healthy, it will write EventID 3000 into the event log. This event will continue to be written every 5 minutes unless there is an issue with a connected device.  <br/> | {"Description":"HardwareCheckEngine is healthy.",<br/> "ResourceState":"Healthy", "OperationName":"HardwareCheckEngine",<br/> "OperationResult":"Pass","OS":"Windows 10",<br/> "OSVersion":"10.0.14393.693","Alias":"alias<span></span>@contoso.com",<br/> "DisplayName":"Display Name","AppVersion":"1.0.38.0",<br/> "IPv4Address":"10.10.10.10","IPv6Address":"ip v6 address"}  <br/> In this example, all hardware checks were passed.
