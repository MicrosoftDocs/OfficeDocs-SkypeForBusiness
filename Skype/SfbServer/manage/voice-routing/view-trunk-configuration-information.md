# View trunk configuration information in Skype for Business Server

SIP trunk configuration settings define the relationship and capabilities between a Mediation Server and the public switched telephone network (PSTN) gateway, an IP-public branch exchange (PBX), or a Session Border Controller (SBC) at the service provider.

- Whether media bypass should be enabled on the trunks.
- The conditions under which real-time transport control protocol (RTCP) packets are sent.
- Whether or not secure real-time protocol (SRTP) encryption is required on each trunk.

When you install Skype for Business Server, a global collection of SIP trunk configuration settings is created for you. In addition, administrators can create custom setting collections at the site scope or at the service scope (for the PSTN gateway service, only).

**To view SIP trunk configuration information by using Skype for Business Server Control Panel**

1. In the Skype for Business Server Control Panel, click **Voice Routing**, and then click **Trunk Configuration**.
2. On the **Trunk Configuration** tab you will see a list of all your trunk configuration settings collections; for each collection you will see values for the **Name**, **Scope**, **State**, and **Media bypass** properties, along with the number of **PSTN usages**, **Calling number rules**, and **Called number rules** associated with the collection. To see additional details about a collection of trunk configuration settings, click the collection of interest, click **Edit**, and then click **Show details**. Note that you can view detailed information only for one collection of trunk configuration settings at a time.

## Viewing SIP trunk configuration information by using Windows PowerShell cmdlets

SIP trunk configuration settings can be viewed by using Skype for Business Server PowerShell and the Get-CsTrunkConfiguration cmdlet. This cmdlet can be run either from the Skype for Business Server Management Shell or from a remote session Windows PowerShell. For details about using remote Windows PowerShell to connect to Skype for Business Server, see the Lync Server Windows PowerShell blog article "Quick Start: Managing Microsoft Lync Server 2010 Using Remote PowerShell" at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=255876.

To view information about all your SIP trunk configuration settings, type the following command in the Skype for Business Server Management Shell, and then press ENTER:

`Get-CsTrunkConfiguration`
