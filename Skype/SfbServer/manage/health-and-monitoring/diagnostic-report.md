# Diagnostic Report in Skype for Business Server
 
**Summary:** Learn about the Diagnostic Report in Skype for Business Server.
  
The Diagnostic Report provides diagnostic and troubleshooting information for a failed session. This information includes both the Diagnostic ID and the Diagnostic header that were reported when the session failed. The Diagnostic ID is a unique identifier (in the form of an ms-diagnostics header) that gets attached to a SIP message, while the Diagnostic header provides an accompanying description for the Diagnostic ID. The report might also contain valuable troubleshooting details that are known by the reporting component. For example:
  
- The cause code provided by the PSTN gateway that generated the failure. When an outgoing call fails on the PSTN network, an ISDN User Part (ISUP) cause code is automatically generated. For example, a PSTN gateway might send cause code 34 to indicate that no circuit or channel was available for completing the call.
    
- Peer FQDN, port, and Winsock errors for connectivity failures.
    
- Names being looked up for DNS resolution failures. DNS resolution takes place any time a client contacts a name server and requests the IP address that corresponds to specified device name.
    
## Accessing the Diagnostic Report

The Diagnostic Report can be accessed by clicking the Diagnostic Report (Detail) metric on either the [Peer-to-Peer Session Detail Report in Skype for Business Server](peer-to-peer-session-detail-report.md) or the Conference Detail Report.
