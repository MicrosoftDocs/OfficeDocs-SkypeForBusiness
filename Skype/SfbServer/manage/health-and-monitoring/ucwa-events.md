# UCWA events in Skype for Business Server
 
**Summary:** Learn about the Unified Communications Web API (UCWA) in Skype for Business Server.
  
Skype for Business Server uses the Unified Communications Web API (UCWA) for a number of purposes, from accessing Microsoft Exchange for contact searches to updating presence for mobile clients.
  
UCWA will write records of operational behavior as event types Informational, Warning, and Error. The following table describes the events that can be written by the UCWA components.
