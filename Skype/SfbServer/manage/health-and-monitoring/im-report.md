# Peer-to-Peer IM Report in Skype for Business Server
 
**Summary:** Learn about the Peer-to-Peer IM Report in Skype for Business Server.
  
The Peer-to-Peer IM Report provides trend information about peer-to-peer instant messaging (IM) sessions, broken down by pool and by authentication type. The report can show either the total number of sessions held during the specified time period (for example, day-by-day or hour-by-hour), or it can show the total number of instant messages sent during that time period.
  
## Accessing the Peer-to-Peer IM Report

You can access the Peer-to-Peer IM Report only by opening the [Peer-to-Peer Activity Summary Report in Skype for Business Server](peer-to-peer-activity-summary-report.md) and then clicking either of the following metrics:
  
- Total peer-to-peer IM sessions
    
- Total peer-to-peer IM messages
    
## Making the Best Use of the Peer-to-Peer IM Report

By default, the Peer-to-Peer IM Report shows you the message count per-hour (or day, depending on your settings). However, you can also choose to view the day by sessions per hour. To do that, click **Hide/Show Parameters** in the upper-right corner of the Reports window, and then click **Session Count** from the **Report by** list.
  
## Filters

Filters provide a way for you to return a more finely targeted set of data or to view the returned data in different ways. The following table lists the filters that you can use with the Peer-to-Peer IM Report.
