Call detail recording (CDR) records usage and diagnostic information about peer-to-peer activities, including instance messaging, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calls, application sharing, file transfer, and meetings.

When you install Skype for Business Server, you will also install a predefined collection of global configuration settings for CDR. Use the topics in this section to configure CDR.
