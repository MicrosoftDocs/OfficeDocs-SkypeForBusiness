# Peer-to-Peer Voice and Video Report in Skype for Business Server
 
**Summary:** Learn about the Peer-to-Peer Voice and Video Report in Skype for Business Server.
  
The Peer-to-Peer Voice and Video Report provides a detailed look at the distribution of voice and video calls over a specified period of time (for example, calls per hour or calls per day). The report also gives you the option of viewing all the voice and video calls that were made, or of viewing only the successful or failed calls. The reports shows call information broken down into the following groupings:
  
- Calls per pool
    
- Calls per call type (for example, a Skype for Business to Skype for Business call vs. a Skype for Business call to a person on the PSTN network)
    
- Calls per access type (users logged on to the internal network vs. users logged on to the external network)
    
- Calls per Mediation Server
