# Peer-to-Peer Activity Summary Report in Skype for Business Server
 
**Summary:** Learn about the Peer-to-Peer Activity Summary Report in Skype for Business Server.
  
The Peer-to-Peer Activity Summary Report provides an overall view of your peer-to-peer communication sessions. A peer-to-peer session typically involves just two users, and does not require the use of the Skype for Business Server conferencing services. By comparison, a conference typically involves more than two users and requires the use of Skype for Business Server conferencing services. Conference activity is reported on the Conference Summary Report.
  
The Peer-to-Peer Activity Summary Report helps you answer questions like the following:
  
- How many peer-to-peer instant messages do my users send on a typical day?
    
- Are any of my users actually taking advantage of the Skype for Business Server application sharing and file transfer capabilities?
    
- Users have been complaining that the network seems slow at certain times of the day. How many minutes are devoted to peer-to-peer audio and video sessions during those time periods?
    
## Accessing the Peer-to-Peer Activity Summary Report

You access the Peer-to-Peer Activity Summary Report from the Monitoring Reports home page. You open the [Peer-to-Peer IM Report in Skype for Business Server](im-report.md) by clicking either of the following metrics:

## Filters

Filters provide a way for you to return a more finely targeted set of data or to view the returned data in different ways. For example, the Peer-to-Peer Activity Summary Report enables you to choose how data should be grouped. In this case, activity grouped by hour, day, week, or month.
