# Mobility performance counters in Skype for Business Server
 
**Summary:** Learn about the performance counters that you can use to monitor servers running the Unified Communications Web API (UCWA) and the Skype for Business Server Mcx Mobility Service.
  
The following tables list the names and descriptions of performance counters that you can use to monitor servers running the Unified Communications Web API (UCWA) and the Skype for Business Server Mcx Mobility Service. 
  
The category name for the counters in the UCWA table is **LS:WEB - UCWA**.
  
The category name for the counters in the Mcx Mobility Service table is **LS:WEB - Mobile Communication Service**.

> [!NOTE]
> MCX (Mobility Service) support for legacy mobile clients is no longer available in Skype for Business Server 2019. All current Skype for Business mobile clients already use Unified Communications Web API (UCWA) to support instant messaging (IM), presence, and contacts. Users with legacy clients using MCX will need to upgrade to a current client.
