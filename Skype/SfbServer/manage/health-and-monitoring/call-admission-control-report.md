# Call Admission Control Report in Skype for Business Server
 
**Summary:** Learn about the Call Admission Control Reports used in Skype for Business Server.
  
The Call Admission Control Report provides information about peer-to-peer and conferencing sessions that were conducted under restrictions set in place by Call Admission Control. Call Admission Control provides a way for administrators to allow (or not allow) communication sessions based on bandwidth constraints. For example, administrators can create policies that impose a limit on the amount of bandwidth available for voice and video calls. If that bandwidth limit has been reached, then no new voice or video calls can be placed until one of the current calls has ended and freed up the required network resources.
  
## Accessing the Call Admission Control Report

The Call Admission Control Report is accessed from the Monitoring Reports home page. From the Call Admission Control Report you can drill down to either of the following reports:
  
- Conference Detail Report - To access this report, click the Details metric from a conference session. 
    
- Peer-to-Peer Session Detail Report - To access this report, click the Details metric for a peer-to-peer session.
    
## Making the Best Use of the Call Admission Control Report

To get a list of calls that failed because of insufficient bandwidth, select Calls rejected because of call admission control from the Call category dropdown list. Most of the returned calls will likely have a diagnostic ID of 5:
  
Insufficient bandwidth to establish session. Attempt PSTN re-route.
  
That indicates that Call Admission Control limitations were preventing the call from being made on the VoIP network.
  
## Filters

Filters provide a way for you to return a more finely-targeted set of data or to view the returned data in different ways. For example, the Call Admission Control Report enables you to filter calls by the user who initiated the call or by the user who was being called. You can also choose how data should be grouped. In this case, calls are grouped by hour, day, week, or month.
  
The following table lists the filters that you can use with the Call Admission Control Report.
