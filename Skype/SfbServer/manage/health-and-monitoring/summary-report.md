# Call Diagnostic Summary Report in Skype for Business Server
 
**Summary:** Learn about the Call Diagnostic Summary Report used in Skype for Business Server.
  
The Call Diagnostic Summary Report provides an overall look at failed peer-to-peer and conferencing sessions. The report shows the overall failure rate for both types of sessions, and further breaks the failure information down by session modality type:
  
- Instant messaging
    
- Application sharing
    
- File transfer
    
- Audio
    
- Video
    
## Accessing the Call Diagnostic Summary Report

The Call Diagnostic Summary Report is accessed from the Monitoring Reports Home page. From the Call Diagnostic Summary Report you can access the [Peer-to-Peer Activity Diagnostic Report in Skype for Business Server](peer-to-peer-activity-diagnostic-report.md) by clicking the Failure rate metric under the Peer-to-Peer Session Summary section of the report. You can also access the [Conference Diagnostic Report in Skype for Business Server](conference-diagnostic-report.md) by clicking any of the following conference metrics:
  
- Overall session failure rate
    
- Focus failure rate
    
- MCU failure rate
    
## Making the Best Use of the Call Diagnostic Summary Report

The Call Diagnostic Summary Report includes graphs that compare failure rates for the various modalities used in Skype for Business Server. The columns in these graphs are actually hotlinks; for example, if you click the Instant messaging column for peer-to-peer sessions, you'll drill down to an instance of the [Peer-to-Peer Activity Diagnostic Report in Skype for Business Server](peer-to-peer-activity-diagnostic-report.md), a report that provides additional details about all the instant messaging sessions included in the Call Diagnostic Summary Report.
  
## Filters

Filters provide a way for you to return a more finely-targeted set of data or to view the returned data in different ways. For example, the Call Diagnostic Summary Report enables you to filter on such things as the Registrar pool or Edge Server used in the session. You can also choose how data should be grouped. In this case, calls are grouped by hour, day, week, or month.
  
The following table lists the filters that you can use with the Call Diagnostic Summary Report.

To view data by day, enter just the date:  <br/> 7/7/2015  <br/> To view by week or by month, enter a date that falls anywhere within the week or month that you want to view (you do not have to enter the first day of the week or month):  <br/> 7/3/2015  <br/> Weeks always run from Sunday through Saturday.  <br/> |
|**To** <br/> |End date/time for the time range. To view data by hours, enter both the end date and time as follows:  <br/> 7/7/2015 1:00 PM  <br/> If you do not enter an end time, the report automatically ends at 12:00 AM on the specified day.
