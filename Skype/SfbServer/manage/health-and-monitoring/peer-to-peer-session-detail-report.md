# Peer-to-Peer Session Detail Report in Skype for Business Server
 
**Summary:** Learn about the Peer-to-Peer Session Detail Report in Skype for Business Server.
  
The Peer-to-Peer Session Detail Report returns detailed information about a peer-to-peer session. For example, if you select an instant messaging session, the report will tell you the number of messages sent by each of the two users in the session.
  
## Accessing the Peer-to-Peer Session Detail Report

The Peer-to-Peer Session Detail Report can be accessed from any of the following reports (all of which can be accessed from the Monitoring Reports home page):
  
- IP Phone Inventory Report
    
- User Activity Report
    
- Call Admission Control Report
    
- Failure List Report 
    
From within the Peer-to-Peer Session Detail Report you can access the [Diagnostic Report in Skype for Business Server](diagnostic-report.md) by clicking the Diagnostic Report (Details) metric. You can also access the Top Failures Report by clicking either of these two metrics:
  
- Response
    
- Diagnostic ID
    
## Making the Best Use of the Peer-to-Peer session Detail Report

The Peer-to-Peer Session Detail Report includes a large number of metrics, many of which might not be familiar to system administrators. Often-times, however, you can view a tooltip that offers a brief description of that metric simply by holding your mouse over the metric label.
  
Note that the actual metrics shown on a given report will depend on the type of peer-to-peer session you selected. An audio/video session will report a different set of metrics than an instant messaging session.
  
You can also hold your mouse over the Response code and Diagnostic ID metrics in order to obtain a description of those values:
  
## Filters
