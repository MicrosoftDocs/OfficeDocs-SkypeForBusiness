# Manage archiving in Skype for Business Server

**Summary:** Learn how to manage archiving for Skype for Business Server.
  
When you deploy archiving for your organization, you specify the initial configuration during deployment. However, there may be times when you want to change how you implement archiving support for day-to-day management or to meet new requirements for your organization. For example, you may need to set up archiving support differently for a specific site, a specific pool, or specific users within your organization. For users homed on Skype for Business Server, you do this by creating and customizing archiving configuration options and user policies. 
  
Before you read this topic, be sure you are familiar with the information in [Plan for archiving in Skype for Business Server](../../plan-your-deployment/archiving/archiving.md) and [Deploy archiving for Skype for Business Server](../../deploy/deploy-archiving/deploy-archiving.md).
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you enable Microsoft Exchange integration for your deployment, Exchange policies control whether archiving is enabled for the users who are homed on Exchange and have their mailboxes put on In-Place Hold. For details, see [Plan for archiving in Skype for Business Server](../../plan-your-deployment/archiving/archiving.md) and [Configure integration with Exchange storage for Skype for Business Server](../../deploy/deploy-archiving/configure-integration-with-exchange-storage.md). 
  
## Archiving configuration options

Archiving configuration options specify whether to:
  
- Enable or disable archiving
    
- Archive IM sessions
    
- Archive web conferencing sessions
    
- Block activity when archiving is not available
    
- Use Exchange integration
    
- Set up purging and exporting of data
    
These options can be set at the global, site, or pool level. For more information, see [Manage archiving options in Skype for Business Server](options.md).
  
## Archiving policies

Archiving policies determine whether to archive the following:
  
- Internal communications
    
- External communications
    
These policies can be set at the global, site, or user level. For more information, see [Manage archiving policies in Skype for Business Server](policies.md).
  
## Manage archiving by using the Control Panel or by using Windows PowerShell

You can manage archiving by using the Control Panel or by using Windows PowerShell. The following table summarizes the cmdlets available to help you manage archiving. For details about syntax, including all available parameters, see [Skype for Business Server Management Shell](../management-shell.md).
