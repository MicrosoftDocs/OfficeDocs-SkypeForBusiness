# Manage conferencing policies in Skype for Business Server
 
**Summary:** Learn how to manage conferencing policies in Skype for Business Server.
  
This topic describes how to manage conferencing policies. For more information about how to plan and deploy conferencing, see [Plan for conferencing in Skype for Business Server](../../plan-your-deployment/conferencing/conferencing.md) and [Deploy conferencing in Skype for Business Server](../../deploy/deploy-conferencing/deploy-conferencing.md).
  
Conferencing policies allow you to define a wide variety of scheduling and participation options, ranging from whether a meeting can include IP audio and video to the maximum number of people who can attend. You can use conferencing policies to manage security, bandwidth, and legal aspects of meetings.
  
You can define conferencing policy on three levels: global scope, site scope, and user scope. Settings apply to a specific user from the narrowest scope to the widest scope. If you assign a policy to a user, those settings take precedence. If you do not assign a user policy, site settings apply. If no user or site policies apply, global policy provides the default settings.
  
A global policy exists by default, so you cannot create a new global policy. You also cannot delete the existing global policy, but you can change the existing global policy to customize your default settings.
