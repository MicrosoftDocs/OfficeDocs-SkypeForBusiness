# Manage key mapping for DTMF commands in Skype for Business Server
 
**Summary:** Learn how to manage key mapping of dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) commands in Skype for Business Server.
  
Dial-in conferencing users can press keys on the telephone keypad to perform dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) commands. DTMF commands enable users who dial in to a conference to control conference settings (such as muting and unmuting themselves or locking and unlocking the conference) by using the keypad on their telephone. 
  
To manage the keys used for the DTMF commands, use the Skype for Business Server Management Shell with the **Get-CsDialinConferencingDtmfConfiguration**, **Set-CsDialinConferencingDtmfConfiguration**, and **New-CsDialinConferencingDtmfConfiguration** cmdlets.
  
When you create new DTMF settings for sites, the site settings take precedence over the global settings. 

### Manage the key mapping of DTMF commands

1. Log on to the computer as a member of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group, or as a member of the Cs-ServerAdministrator or CsAdministrator role.
    
2. Start the Skype for Business Server Management Shell: Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Skype for Business 2015**, and then click **Skype for Business Server Management Shell**.
    
3. To view the DTMF settings used for dial-in conferencing, run the following command at the command prompt :
    
   ```
   Get-CsDialinConferencingDtmfConfiguration
   ```

4. To modify the DTMF settings used for dial-in conferencing, run the following cmdlet and specify the key to be pressed for each option that you want to change:
    
   ```
   Set-CsDialinConferencingDtmfConfiguration [-Identity <global or site collection to be changed>]
   [-AdmitAll <default key is 8>] [-AudienceMuteCommand <default key is 4>]
   [-CommandCharacter <* (default) | #>] [-EnableDisableAnnouncementsCommand <default key is 9>]
   [-HelpCommand <default key is 1>] [-LockUnlockConferenceCommand <default key is 7>]
   [-MuteUnmuteCommand <default key is 6>] [-PrivateRollCallCommand <default key is 3>]
   ```

5. (Optional) To create additional sets of DTMF commands for specific sites, use the **New-CsDialinConferencingDtmfConfiguration** cmdlet with a site identity.
    
The following example swaps the key that is pressed to enable or disable announcements and the key that is pressed to mute and unmute all participants. Because no Identity is specified, these changes apply to the global DTMF settings:
  
```
Set-CsDialinConferencingDtmfConfiguration -EnableDisableAnnouncementsCommand 4 -AudienceMuteCommand 9
```
