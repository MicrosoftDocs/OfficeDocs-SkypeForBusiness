# Manage conferencing in Skype for Business Server
 
**Summary:** Learn how to manage conferencing in Skype for Business Server.
  
This topic describes how to manage conferencing. For more information about how to plan and deploy conferencing, see [Plan for conferencing in Skype for Business Server](../../plan-your-deployment/conferencing/conferencing.md) and [Deploy conferencing in Skype for Business Server](../../deploy/deploy-conferencing/deploy-conferencing.md).
  
In Skype for Business Server, you manage the details of conferencing by specifying configuration and policy settings as follows. Note that the terms conferencing and meeting are sometimes used interchangeably. But, in general, you can think of a meeting as a specific instance of conferencing.
  
- **Conferencing policy settings** encompass a wide variety of scheduling and participation options, ranging from whether a meeting can include IP audio and video to the maximum number of people who can attend. You can use conferencing policies to manage security, bandwidth, and legal aspects of meetings.
    
    Note that conferencing policies are applied to the user or site and cannot be applied to a specific meeting. Therefore, the meeting invitation for the conference can be created some weeks in advance, but the restrictive conferencing policy should be applied to the Meeting Organizer's Skype for Business account just before the conference starts. 
    
    If a dedicated account is used for the Meeting Organizer role, the conferencing policy can remain assigned to that account. If the Meeting Organizer uses a general Skype for Business account, the policy must be removed after the conference is finished.
    
- **Meeting configuration settings** dictate the type of meetings that users can create, in addition to controlling how (or even if) anonymous users and dial-in conferencing users can join these meetings. Note that these settings only affect scheduled meetings. Meeting configurations are applied per pool, per site, or globally.
    
- **Conferencing configuration settings** determine such things as the maximum allowed size for meeting content and handouts; maximum amount of bandwidth for the Application Sharing Conferencing service; storage limits and expiration periods; the URLs for the internal and external downloads of the supported client; pointers to internal and external URLs where users can obtain conferencing help and resources; and the ports used for application sharing, client audio, file transfers, and media traffic.
    
    These settings allow you to manage the actual servers themselves. These settings can only be set by using Skype for Business Server Management Shell. 
    
- **Dial-in access settings** allow you to define information about whether and how users dial in from a phone. You specify some of the dial-in access information, such as access number, from the Control Panel Conferencing tab and some dial-in information--such as dial plan, voice policy, route, and PSTN usage--from the Control Panel Voice Routing tab.
    
- **PIN policy settings** allow you to name and define the PIN that participants use for dial-in access.
    
## Manage conferencing by using Skype for Business Server Control Panel or by using Skype for Business Server Management Shell

You can manage most conferencing policies and configuration settings by using Skype for Business Server Control Panel or by using Skype for Business Server Management Shell. Some configuration settings are available only by using Skype for Business Server Management Shell.
  
- To manage conferencing policy settings:
    
  - In Control Panel, select **Conferencing | Conferencing Policy**.
    
  - In PowerShell, search for the **-CsConferencingPolicy** cmdlets.
    
- To manage meeting configuration settings:
    
  - In Control Panel, select **Conferencing | Meeting configuration**.
    
  - In Skype for Business Server Management Shell, search for the **-CsMeetingConfiguration** cmdlets.
    
- To manage dial-in access number settings:
    
  - In Control Panel, select **Conferencing | Dial-in access number**.
    
  - In Skype for Business Server Management Shell, search for the **-CsDialInConferencing** cmdlets.
    
- To manage dial-in access information, such as dial plan, voice policy, route, and PSTN usage: 
    
  - In Control Panel, select **Conferencing | Voice routing**.
    
  - In Skype for Business Server Management Shell, search for the **-CsDialPlan** and **-CsVoice** cmdlets.
    
- To manage PIN policy settings:
    
  - In Control Panel, select **Conferencing | PIN policy**.
    
  - In Skype for Business Server Management Shell, search for the **-CsPinPolicy** cmdlets.
    
- To manage conferencing configuration settings, you must use the Skype for Business Server Management Shell. Search for **-CsConferencingConfiguration** cmdlets.
