# Send welcome email to dial-in users in Skype for Business Server
 
**Summary:** Learn how to welcome users to dial-in conferencing in Skype for Business Server.
  
After you configure dial-in conferencing and test to verify that it is functioning properly, you should set initial personal identification numbers (PINs) for users and notify users about the availability of the feature. You can include introductory instructions such as the initial PIN and the link to the Dial-in Conferencing Settings web page. 
  
Typically, you use the **Set-CsClientPin** cmdlet to reset PINs, but you can use the procedure in this topic if you want to send an introductory welcome email with the PIN information. If you do not want to send the email, you can use **Set-CsClientPin** instead.
  
You can use the **Set-CsPinSendCAWelcomeMail** script to set the PIN and send a welcome email to a single user. By default, the script does not reset a PIN if it is already set, but you can use the Force parameter to force reset a PIN. The email message is sent using Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).
  
You can create a script that runs the **Set-CsPinSendCAWelcomeMail** script iteratively to set PINs and send email to a group of users. You can modify the email template (that is, the CAWelcomeEmailTemplate.html file) to add more links to intranet pages or modify the email text.
  


## Set an initial PIN and send welcome email

1. Log on as a member of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group.
    
2. Start the Skype for Business Server Management Shell: Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Skype for Business 2015**, and then click **Skype for Business Server Management Shell**.
    
3. Run the following at the command prompt:
    
   ```
   Set-CsPinSendCAWelcomeMail -UserUri <user identifier>
   -From <email address of sender> [-Subject <subject for email message>]
   [-UserEmailAddress <destination email address>]
   [-Cc <email address of recipients who receive copy of email>]
   [-Bcc <email address of recipients who receive blind copies>]
   [-TemplatePath <path for email template>]
   [-SmtpServer] <SMTP server name>]
   [-BodyAsPlainText] [-UseSsl]
   [-Pin <new numeric PIN>] [-Force] `
   [-Credential <SMTP server credentials used to send email with the specified From address>]
   ```

**SmtpServer** By default, the script uses the value of the reserved environment variable **$PSEmailServer** for this parameter. If the **$PSEmailServer** variable is not set, you must specify this parameter.
    
**Credential** By default, the script uses the credentials of the current user. If the current user does not have permission to send email on behalf of the specified From address, you must specify this parameter. As a general rule, specify this parameter if you do not specify your email address as the From address.
    
The following example creates a new PIN, and then sends a welcome email from Marco to Bob. It uses the email text from the default template and creates the email message in HTML format. The default Subject is "Welcome to Dial In Conferencing":
  
```
Set-CsPinSendCAWelcomeMail -UserUri "bob@contoso.com"
-From "marco@contoso.com"
```

The next example forces a new PIN with a value of "383042650" for Bob, even though Bob had an existing PIN, and then sends a welcome email from Marco to Bob. Because the Credential parameter is specified, the person running the command is prompted to enter a password. The email is sent by using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL):
  
```
Set-CsPinSendCAWelcomeMail -UserUri "bob@contoso.com"
-From "marco@contoso.com" -Subject "Your new dial-in conferencing PIN"
-Pin "383042650" -Force
-Credential Admin@contoso.com -UseSsl
```
