# Assign conferencing policies in Skype for Business Server
 
**Summary:** Learn how to assign conferencing policies in Skype for Business Server.
  
You can assign conferencing policies to users by using Skype for Business Server Management Shell and the **Grant-CsConferencingPolicy** cmdlet.
  
## Assign conferencing policies by using Skype for Business Server Management Shell

In the following example, the policy SalesConferencingPolicy is assigned to the user with the Identity "Ken Myer":
  
```PowerShell
Grant-CsConferencingPolicy -identity "Ken Myer" -PolicyName SalesConferencingPolicy
```

In the next example, the conferencing policy FinanceConferencingPolicy is assigned to all the users who have accounts in the Finance organizational unit. To assign the same policy to all the users in a given organizational unit (OU), the Get-CsUser cmdlet is used to retrieve all the accounts in that OU. After the user accounts have been retrieved, that information is then piped to the Grant-CsConferencingPolicy cmdlet, which assigns the FinanceConferencingPolicy policy to each user in the collection:
  
```PowerShell
Get-CsUser -OU "ou=Finance,dc=litwareinc,dc=com" | Grant-CsConferencingPolicy -PolicyName FinanceConferencingPolicy
```

For more information, including complete syntax and a list of parameters, see [Grant-CsConferencingPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/grant-csconferencingpolicy?view=skype-ps).
