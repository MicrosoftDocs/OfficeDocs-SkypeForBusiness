# Conferencing Policy

Conferencing policy defines the features and capabilities that users have available during a conference (also known as a meeting).

Conferencing policies include the global policy and, optionally, one or more site and user policies:

- **Global policy:** The global policy is created by default. You can edit the global policy, but you cannot delete it. If you try to remove the global policy, all the settings are reset to the default values.

- **Site policies (optional):** You can create one or more site conferencing policies, each of which applies to a specific site. Site policies override the global policy.

- **User policies (optional):** You can create one or more user conferencing policies, each of which applies to a specific user or group of users. User policies override the global policy and site policies.

The **Conferencing Policy** page displays a list of all the conferencing policies that are defined for your organization.

## Tasks you can perform

You can perform the following tasks from the **Location Policy** page:

- Create a new site conferencing policy or user conferencing policy
