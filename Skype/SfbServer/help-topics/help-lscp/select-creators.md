# Select Creators

Creating and managing Persistent Chat rooms is much easier with the correct use of categories. A Persistent Chat administrator can define **AllowedMembers** and **Creators** for each category, and can also define the default chat room settings and behaviors that will be applied to all chat rooms created in the category. Persistent Chat administrators create and manage categories by using Skype for Business Server Control Panel or Windows PowerShell cmdlets.

## Tasks that you can perform

You can perform the following tasks on the **Select Creators** page:

- [Configure Categories](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/4547f514-f0c0-404d-890f-092ddeeac852.aspx)

- [New Persistent Chat Server Features](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/c3ec6f33-6261-4bf5-aa31-baa8ab2a87d8.aspx)

For details about the different procedures that you can perform by using the Skype for Business Server Control Panel, see [Manage Skype for Business Server 2015](../../manage/manage.md).

## To configure categories for chat rooms

In **Membership**, in the **Creators** section, add or remove users and other Active Directory principals associated with creators for the category. A creator is a user who has permissions to create chat rooms and assign chat room managers and members.
