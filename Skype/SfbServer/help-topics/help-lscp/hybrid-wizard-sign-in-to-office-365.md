# Hybrid wizard: Sign in to Office 365

Use the Skype for Business Server Hybrid Manageability wizard to help you configure your environment for hybrid with Skype for Business Online.

## Sign in to Office 365

Enter the user name and password for your Office 365 tenant to login and connect your on-premises deployment with your Office 365 tenant. You'll need to use the admin account that was created for the onmicrosoft domain when you signed up for Office 365, for example, admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com.

For more information about how to configure your environment for hybrid, see [Overview of hybrid deployments](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/f6610f2f-c804-4f36-81fc-7aa3297bb4a2.aspx).
