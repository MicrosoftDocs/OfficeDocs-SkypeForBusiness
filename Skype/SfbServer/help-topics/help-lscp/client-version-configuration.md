# Client Version Configuration

In addition to specifying the version of clients that you want to support in your environment, you can also specify a default action for clients that do not already have a version policy defined. This enables you to restrict which client versions are used in your environment, which can help you to control the costs associated with supporting multiple client versions.

## Tasks you can perform

You can perform the following tasks on the **Client Version Configuration** page:

- Edit the default ( **Global**) client version configuration.

- Create client version configuration for a particular site.

- Enable and disable existing client version configurations.

> [!NOTE]
> Because anonymous users are not associated with a site, anonymous users are affected by global-level policies only.

## UI Reference

The following lists describe the menus, command, fields, and properties on the page.

- **New** You can create a client version configuration for a particular site.

- **Edit** You can change the options of any of the client version policies. Using this option, you can do the following:

  - **Show details** This option opens a dialog box in which you can change the options for a client version configuration.

  - **Select All** This option selects all client version configurations in the list.

  - **Delete** This option deletes all selected client version configurations.

- **Refresh** You can refresh the client version configuration list to verify the status of the options of all client version configurations.
