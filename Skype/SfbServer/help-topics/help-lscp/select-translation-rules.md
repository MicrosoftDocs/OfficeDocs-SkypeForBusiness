description: "Enterprise Voice requires that all dial strings be normalized to E.164 format for the purpose of performing reverse number lookup (RNL). The trunk peer (that is, the associated gateway, PBX, or SIP trunk) may require that numbers be in a local dialing format. To translate numbers from E.164 format to a local dialing format, you can optionally define one or more translation rules to manipulate the Request URI before routing it to the trunk peer. For example, you could write a translation rule to remove +44 from the beginning of a dial string and replace it with 0144."

# Select Translation Rules
 
 Enterprise Voice requires that all dial strings be normalized to E.164 format for the purpose of performing reverse number lookup (RNL). The trunk peer (that is, the associated gateway, PBX, or SIP trunk) may require that numbers be in a local dialing format. To translate numbers from E.164 format to a local dialing format, you can optionally define one or more translation rules to manipulate the Request URI before routing it to the trunk peer. For example, you could write a translation rule to remove +44 from the beginning of a dial string and replace it with 0144.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The ability to associate one or more translation rules with an Enterprise Voice trunk configuration is intended to be used as an alternative to configuring translation rules on the trunk peer. Do not associate translation rules with an Enterprise Voice trunk configuration if you have configured translation rules on the trunk peer because the two rules might conflict. 
  
To use an existing translation rule, click a rule in the list and then click **OK**.
