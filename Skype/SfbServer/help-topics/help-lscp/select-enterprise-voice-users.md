# Select Enterprise Voice Users
 
Use the **Select Enterprise Voice Users** dialog box to find users who are enabled for Enterprise Voice. In the search box, type the SIP address or display name of the user that you want to find, and then click **Find**. To select a user, click the user in the search results list and then click **OK**. If you cannot find the user that you are looking for, that user might not be enabled for Enterprise Voice. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> To retrieve all users enabled for Enterprise Voice, do not type anything in the search box. You can also find all users whose display names or SIP addresses begin with a certain string. For example, to find all users whose SIP address begins with ken, type sip:ken. This will return users such as sip:kenmyer@fabrikam.com, sip:kenkwok.fabrikam.com, and sip:kenmallit@fabrikam.com. 
  
For details about the different procedures that you can perform by using the Skype for Business Server Control Panel, see [Manage Skype for Business Server 2015](../../manage/manage.md).
