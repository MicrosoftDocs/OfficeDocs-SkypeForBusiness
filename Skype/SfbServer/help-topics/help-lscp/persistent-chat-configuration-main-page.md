# Persistent Chat Configuration Main Page
 
Your Persistent Chat Server deployment can host many concurrent Persistent Chat rooms. Chat rooms can be organized into a set of categories on the server. Each chat room belongs to one category, and inherits some settings from that category. This organization creates a useful structure for identifying conversations, based on their business purpose, and facilitates delegated administration and simplified management.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Although many of the management features of chat rooms are available in computers running Persistent Chat for the user, Persistent Chat Administrators (in the **cspersistentchatadministrator** role) must use the control panel or management shell cmdlets to create or manage categories.
  
Persistent Chat Administrators use Skype for Business Server Control Panel or Windows PowerShell cmdlets to create and manage categories, and to design access for chat rooms for the users in their organization.
  
Persistent Chat room managers, who have the ability to manage one or more chat rooms, can use the client to launch a room management Web application to create and manage rooms (or customers can create custom solutions and workflows to be invoked). 
  
Chat room managers can make changes to all chat room properties, except for changing the category of the room. They cannot be restricted from performing the following actions:
  
- Disabling a chat room
    
- Changing a chat room name
    
- Changing a chat room description
    
- Changing a chat room type (Auditorium versus Normal)
    
- Changing the privacy of a room (open versus closed versus secret)
    
- Adding or removing members
    
- Adding or removing chat room managers
    
- Adding or removing an add-in
    
- Changing settings such as invitations (according to what's permitted by the category)
    
## Tasks that you can perform

You can perform the following tasks on the **Persistent Chat Configuration** page: configure Persistent Chat Server options globally or for a specific pool
  
## To configure Persistent Chat options globally

1. From a user account that is assigned to the CsPersistentChatAdministrator or CsAdministrator role, log on to any computer in your internal deployment.
    
2. From the **Start** menu, select the Skype for Business Server Control Panel or open a browser window, and then enter the Admin URL.
    
3. In the left navigation bar, click **Persistent Chat**, and then click **Persistent Chat Configuration**.
    
4. On the **Persistent Chat Configuration** page, click **New,** and then click **Site configuration**.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Choose this option if you want the configuration to be applied to all Persistent Chat Server pools deployed in the site. Click **Pool Configuration** if you want the configuration to be applied to a specific Persistent Chat Server pool.
  
5. In **Select a Site**, select the site to be configured for the Persistent Chat Server site configuration.
    
6. In **New Persistent Chat Configuration**, do the following:
    
   - In **Name**, specify a name for the new configuration settings. By default, the site name already exists.
    
   - In **Default chat history**, define the number of chat messages that will be processed for each room upon first request. By default, the number is 30. This is the global default, and administrators can disable chat history per category.
    
     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > Persistent Chat Server will cache these messages in memory, so if you increase this number, more messages will be cached. You can always access historical content by search. The default number simply determines the maximum number of messages that you initially see when connecting to a chat room. 
  
   - In **Maximum file size (KB)**, select the maximum file size of each chat history. By default, the number is 20 MB (20,000 KB). This is the maximum size for a file that can be uploaded to any chat room in the system (for which file uploads are enabled by its corresponding **Category** setting).
    
   - In **Participant update limit**, select the limit for participant updates. Persistent Chat Server sends roster information (who is connected to a chat room) to all participants until the number of connected users reaches this number. By default, the number is 75. This limit indicates the maximum number of participants in a given room beyond which Persistent Chat Server stops sending roster updates to connected clients about who is present in the room.
    
   - (Optional.) In **Room management URL**, select the room management URL. This is the URL for a web-based custom room management. If you don't need to customize room management, and you simply use the default setting, leave this option blank. After the URL is set, it is applied as both the internal and external room management URL.
    
     If you want to customize your room creation experience and include your specific business workflow, you can build a custom room management solution by using the Persistent Chat Server Software Development Kit (SDK), host it somewhere, and put the URL here. This URL is sent down to the client, so that when a user tries to view or create a room, he or she is directed to your custom room management solution.
    
7. Click **Commit**.

5. In **Select a Service**, select the service associated with the Persistent Chat Server pool to be configured.
    
6. In **New Persistent Chat Configuration**, do the following:
    
   - In **Name**, specify a name for the new configuration settings. By default, the site pool name already exists.
    
   - In **Default chat history**, define the number of chat messages that will be processed for each room upon first request. By default, the number is 30. This is the global default, and administrators can disable chat history per category.
