# Location Policy

Location policies determine whether Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-1) is enabled and how it is used, as well as how location information is used for users and contacts.

Location policies include the global policy and, optionally, one or more site and user policies:

- **Global policy:** The global policy is created by default. You can edit the global policy, but you cannot delete it. If you try to remove the global policy, all the settings are reset to the default values.

- **Site policies (optional):** You can create one or more site location policies, each of which applies to a specific site. Site policies override the global policy.

- **User policies (optional):** You can create one or more user location policies, each of which applies to a specific user or group of users. User policies override the global policy and site policies.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also assign location policies to network sites, which are groups of subnets. Location policies assigned to network sites take precedence over all other user policies. For details about assigning location policies to network sites by using cmdlets, see [Add a location policy to a network site in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../deploy/deploy-enterprise-voice/add-a-location-policy-to-a-network-site.md). For details about using Skype for Business Server Control Panel to assign a location policy to a network site, see [Configuring Network Sites](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/358aa08a-c5bc-45fc-8017-19e6202f88c5.aspx).

The **Location Policy** page displays a list of all the location policies that are defined for your organization.

## Tasks you can perform

You can perform the following tasks from the **Location Policy** page:

- Create a new site location policy or user location policy

    > [!NOTE]
