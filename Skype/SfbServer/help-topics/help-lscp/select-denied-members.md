# Select Denied Members

A Persistent Chat Administrator can create and manage chat room categories. As part of creating and managing chat room categories, a Persistent Chat Administrator can configure principals (Active Directory Domain Services groups/containers/users) that have access to be members/creators of chat rooms of a particular category. A Persistent Chat Administrator can also add DeniedMembers to a category and these become explicit exclusions to the allowed list. DeniedMembers override what's in AllowedMembers.

## Tasks that you can perform

You can perform the following tasks on the **Select Denied Members** page:

- [Configure Categories](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/4547f514-f0c0-404d-890f-092ddeeac852.aspx)

- [New Persistent Chat Server Features](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/c3ec6f33-6261-4bf5-aa31-baa8ab2a87d8.aspx)

For details about the different procedures that you can perform by using the Skype for Business Server Control Panel, see [Manage Skype for Business Server 2015](../../manage/manage.md).

## To configure categories for chat rooms

In **Membership**, in the **Denied members** section, add or remove users and other Active Directory principals associated with members being denied from the room.
