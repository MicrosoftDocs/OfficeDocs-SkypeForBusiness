# Select Denied Members

A Persistent Chat Administrator can create and manage chat room categories. As part of creating and managing chat room categories, a Persistent Chat Administrator can configure principals (Active Directory Domain Services groups/containers/users) that have access to be members/creators of chat rooms of a particular category. A Persistent Chat Administrator can also add DeniedMembers to a category and these become explicit exclusions to the allowed list. DeniedMembers override what's in AllowedMembers.

## Tasks that you can perform

You can perform the following tasks on the **Select Denied Members** page:

- [Configure Categories](/previous-versions/office/lync-server-2013/lync-server-2013-configure-categories)

- [New Persistent Chat Server Features](/previous-versions/office/lync-server-2013/lync-server-2013-new-persistent-chat-server-features)

For details about the different procedures that you can perform by using the Skype for Business Server Control Panel, see [Manage Skype for Business Server 2015](../../manage/manage.md).

## To configure categories for chat rooms

In **Membership**, in the **Denied members** section, add or remove users and other Active Directory principals associated with members being denied from the room.
