# Unassigned Phone Number: Create New or Edit Existing

Unassigned numbers are phone numbers that are valid for your organization but are not assigned to a user or a phone. The unassigned number table identifies how you want calls to unassigned numbers to be treated.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you are finished creating a new unassigned number range or editing an existing one, click **OK** to return to the **Unassigned Number** page that lists all the number ranges. The changes you made on the **New Unassigned Number Range** page or the **Edit Unassigned Number Rage** page are not committed to the database until you click **Commit all** on the **Unassigned Number** page.

## UI Reference

The following list describes the fields on the page.

- **Name** Type a descriptive name that identifies the unassigned number range. After you save the range, this name cannot be changed.

- **Number range** In the first field, type the beginning number of the unassigned number range. In the second field, type the ending number of the range.

  - The beginning number of the range must be less than or equal to the ending number of the range.

  - If the beginning number of the range or the ending number of the range includes an extension number, both the beginning number and the ending number of the range must include an extension, and the extension number must be the same for both the beginning number and the ending number.

  - The number must match the regular expression (tel:)?(\+)?[1-9]\d{0,17}(;ext=[1-9]\d{0,9})?. This means the number may begin with the string tel: (if you don't specify that string it will be automatically added for you), a plus sign (+), and a digit 1 through 9. The phone number can be up to 17 digits and may be followed by an extension in the format ;ext= followed by the extension number.

- **Announcement service** Select **Announcement** to have the Announcement application handle the incoming call or **Exchange UM** to have an Exchange UM Auto Attendant handle the incoming call.

- If you selected **Announcement** for **Announcement service**:

  - **FQDN of destination server** Select the service ID of the Application service that runs the Announcement application that will handle incoming calls to this range of unassigned numbers.

  - **Announcement** Select the announcement to be played for this range of unassigned numbers.

- If you selected **Exchange UM** for **Announcement service**:

  - **Auto Attendant phone number** Select the phone number for the Exchange UM Auto Attendant.
