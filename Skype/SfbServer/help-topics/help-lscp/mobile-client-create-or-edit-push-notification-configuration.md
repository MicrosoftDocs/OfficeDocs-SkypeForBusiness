# Mobile Client: Create or Edit Push Notification Configuration
 
Push Notification and the Push Notification Clearing House (PNCH) are two key parts of the mobility feature. Push notification is the process where a message is sent to the PNCH. The message is held here until it can be delivered to the mobile client, or the timeout period expires. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> The time period is set at the Push Notification Clearing House and is not configurable by the user or the administrator of your deployment. 
  
To enable Push Notification, you do the following:
  
1. **Scope:** Note the scope for this policy. It can either be **Global**, which applies to all users in this deployment, or **Site**, which is only users assigned to home servers in the specified site.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Policy settings that are applied at one policy level can override settings that are applied at another policy level. Policy precedence is: User policy (most influence) overrides a Site policy, and then a Site policy overrides a Global policy (least influence). This means that the closer the policy setting is to the object that the policy is affecting, the more influence it has on the object. 
  
2. Select which push notification services you want to enable by clicking the check box for:
    
   - **Enable Microsoft push notification** will enable the push notification to the cloud-based PNCH for Windows Phone with the Skype for Business app
    
   - **Enable Apple push notification** will enable the push notification to the Apple PNCH for devices running Apple's iOS (for example, iPhone, iPad) and using the Skype for Business app
    
3. When you have completed the edits of the policy, click **Commit** to save your changes. If you need to delete the changes you have made, select **Cancel**. No changes will be saved to the policy.
