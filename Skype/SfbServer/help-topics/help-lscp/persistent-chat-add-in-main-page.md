# Persistent Chat Add-in Main Page

You can use the **Add-in** section of the **Persistent Chat** page to associate URLs with Persistent Chat rooms. These URLs appear in the client in the chat room in the conversation extensibility pane. An administrator must add Add-ins to the list of registered add-ins, and chat room managers/Creators must associate rooms with one of the registered add-ins before users can see this upgrade in their client.

Add-ins are used to extend the in-room experience. A typical add-in might include a URL pointing to a Silverlight application that intercepts when a stock ticker is posted to a chat room, and shows the stock history in the extensibility pane. Other examples include embedding a OneNote 2013 URL in the chat room as an add-in to include some shared context, such as "Top of mind" or "Topic of the day."

To create Add-ins for Persistent Chat rooms, see [Configure add-ins for Persistent Chat rooms in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../manage/persistent-chat/configure-add-ins.md). If you are a Persistent Chat Administrator, you can create add-ins by using the control panel or Windows PowerShell cmdlets.

## Tasks you can perform

You can perform the following tasks on the **Add-in** page:

- [Configure add-ins for Persistent Chat rooms in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../manage/persistent-chat/configure-add-ins.md)

## To configure Add-ins for chat rooms

The following lists describe the menus, command, fields, and properties on the page.

1. From a user account that is assigned to the CsPersistentChatAdministrator or CsAdministrator role, log on to any computer in your internal deployment.

2. From the **Start** menu, select the Skype for Business Server Control Panel or open a browser window, and then enter the Admin URL. For details about the different methods that you can use to start control panel, see [Open Lync Server Administrative Tools](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/8c58de94-9e0a-4368-9e14-9afcaa1142d0.aspx).

4. On the **Add-in** page, click **New**.

5. In **Select a Service**, select the service corresponding to the Persistent Chat Server pool where you need to create the Add-in. Add-ins cannot be moved from one pool to another or shared between different pools.

6. In **New Add-in**, do the following:

   - In **Name**, specify a name for the new add-in.

   - In **URL**, specify the URL to be associated with the add-in. URLs are limited to http and https protocols.
