# Skype for Business Server Mediation Collocation planning tool
 
The Mediation Server is collocated with the Front End Server by default. The Mediation Server can also be deployed in a stand-alone pool for performance reasons, or if you deploy SIP trunking, in which case the stand-alone pool is recommended. Collocation in Skype for Business Server functions just as it did in Lync Server 2013. For details, see the following topics:
  
- [Supported server collocation in Lync Server 2013](/previous-versions/office/lync-server-2013/lync-server-2013-supported-server-collocation)
    
- [Mediation Server component in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../plan-your-deployment/enterprise-voice-solution/mediation-server.md)
