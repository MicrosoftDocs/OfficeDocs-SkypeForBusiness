# Business Server 2015 IP Version (planning tool)
 
You have three options when configuring IP addresses in Skype for Business Server 2015. You can configure Skype for Business Server 2015 to support only IP version 4 (IPv4), only IP version 6 (IPv6), or a combination of both (known as a dual stack).
  
For more details about choosing your IP infrastructure, see [Plan for IPv6 in Skype for Business](../../plan-your-deployment/network-requirements/ipv6.md).
