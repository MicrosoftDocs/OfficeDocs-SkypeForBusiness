# AV MCU Settings Expander
 
To edit the properties for an A/V Conferencing Server pool that you have already defined, do the following:
  
## General Settings

To update the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the A/V Conferencing Server pool, type in the name of the pool as it is defined in the Domain Name System (DNS). You must have a DNS host (A) record that corresponds with the A/V Conferencing Server pool name.
  
## A/V Conferencing Service

To associate an A/V Conferencing Server pool, select the Front End pool or pools that you have to associate with the A/V Conferencing Server pool.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If no Front End pools are displayed in the **Select the Front End pools to associate with this A/V Conferencing pool** pane, you have either collocated the A/V Conferencing Server with the Front End pool, or did not select to add Conferencing in the **Features and functionality** section of the Front End pool properties.
  


When finished, click **OK** to complete the editing of the A/V Conferencing Server pool settings. Click **Cancel** to discard any changes.
