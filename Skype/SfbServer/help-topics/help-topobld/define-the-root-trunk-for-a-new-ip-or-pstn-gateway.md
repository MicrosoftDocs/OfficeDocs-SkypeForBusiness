# Define the Root Trunk for a New IP or PSTN Gateway

You define the root trunk for the IP or public switched telephone network (PSTN) by configuring the following:

- **Trunk name**: define the fully qualified domain name associated with the trunk

- **Listening port for IP/PSTN gateway**: define the port that this trunk will listen on

- **SIP Transport Protocol**: select from the list either **TCP** or **TLS**, based on the trunk requirements

- **Associated Mediation Server**: select from the list of available Mediation Servers in your deployment

- **Associated Mediation Server port**: define the port that the selected Mediation Server is listening on
