# Edge Settings Expander

To edit the settings for an existing single or multiple server Edge pool, you are presented with the following sections:

- General settings

- Next hop selection settings

- Edge Server configuration



## General settings

Internal pool fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the Edge Server pool. Edit the FQDN of the pool to change this setting.

Select the check box **Enable federation for this Edge pool (Port 5061)** if you will set up federation with a Lync Server 2013, Microsoft Lync Server 2010 or Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2 trusted partner.

Select **Enable XMPP federation for this Edge pool** to enable XMPP federation.

Specify the port number for **Internal Configuration Replication Port (HTTPS)**.

## Next hop selection settings

To set or modify the **Next hop pool** that the Edge Servers will use to communicate to the internal infrastructure, select a Director, Director pool, Front End Server, or Front End Server pool from the drop-down list box. Only Directors or Front Ends that have been configured in Topology Builder will appear for selection.

## Edge Server configuration

To edit or specify settings for the **External Settings** for the Edge Servers, you first must determine if you will use separate IP addresses for SIP access, web conferencing, and the Audio/Video service.

If you intend to use separate IP addresses for each, select the check box **Enable separate FQDN and IP address for Web conferencing and A/V**. Each service must have a corresponding DNS host (A) record created for it.

For each of the external-facing services, you specify a FQDN and an associated port. For example, the **SIP Access** would use sip.contoso.com with an associated port of 5061.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you select separate FQDNs for each of the external-facing services, each service must have a unique port value associated with it. By default, the SIP is on port 5061/TLS, the web conferencing edge service is on port 444/TLS, and the A/V Conferencing Server is on port 443/TLS. If you make changes to any of these settings, including using separate FQDN and IP addresses or ports, you must update all the other services that will rely on the initially configured values.

If you determine that your organization will use a single FQDN and IP address for the external-facing services, clear the **Enable separate FQDN and IP address for Web conferencing and A/V** check box. You can then edit the **SIP Access** pool FQDN and port values, if necessary.
