# Associate Front End With Archiving
 
Each Front End pool and Survivable Branch Appliance can have only one Archiving Server associated with it. When archiving is enabled for the site, Archiving Server then collects and records instant messaging (IM) message content and web conference content from conversations involving the users homed on the associated pools and Survivable Branch Appliances. 
  
All pools at a site and the pools of multiple central sites can use the same Archiving Server, if usage does not exceed the capacity of the Archiving Server.
