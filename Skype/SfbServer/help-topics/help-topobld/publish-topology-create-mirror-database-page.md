# Publish Topology Create Mirror Database Page
 
This is preliminary documentation and is subject to change. Blank topics are included as placeholders.
  
Topology Builder parses all configuration settings in your defined topology document. If you have configured mirrored SQL Server databases, you are presented a screen that displays the mirror store, the primary store, file share path, and the database paths. You select a check box associated with a database mirror store to create the mirrored database and the file share path. You clear a checkbox for a database mirror if you do not want to create and deploy the database to the defined SQL Server.
  
 If you select to choose not to install one or all of these databases at this time, you clear the databases that you will not install. At a later time, you choose to use **Install Database** by right clicking on most node items in Topology Builder.
