# Add Mediation Server
 
To define the Mediation Server, specify a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the Mediation Server pool. If you are creating a pool of Mediation Servers, you will specify the name of the pool for the Mediation Servers you are deploying. You will define the FQDNs of the individual servers in another step. If you are deploying a single Mediation Server, the FQDN you specify will be the FQDN of the single Mediation Server. For details, see [Deploy a Mediation Server in Topology Builder in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../deploy/deploy-enterprise-voice/deploy-a-mediation-server.md).
