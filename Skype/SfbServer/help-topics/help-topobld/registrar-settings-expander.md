# Registrar Settings Expander
 
Resiliency provides high availability and disaster recovery for the Registrar pool. By providing a backup Registrar in the event of failure of the primary Registrar, the backup Registrar can take over for the failed Registrar, allowing users to log on and communicate. Users can potentially experience reduced functionality, depending on which systems have failed with the primary Registrar.
  
In the **Resiliency** section of the **Edit Properties** dialog box for your Survivable Branch Appliance or Survivable Branch Server, you can change the following settings:
  
- **Associated User service and backup Registrar pool** In the drop-down list, select the Enterprise Edition Front End pool or Standard Edition Front End Server that is to act as the backup Registrar for the Survivable Branch Appliance or Survivable Branch Server.
    
- **Enable Failover and Failback** Select this setting to allow for the automatic detection of a failed Registrar and the automatic determination that the primary Registrar is back up and ready to resume the Registrar process.
    
- **Failure detection interval (sec)** Type the number of seconds that should elapse before it is determined that the primary Registrar has failed. The default value is 120 seconds. This field is required if you select **Enable Failover and Failback**.
    
- **Fallback detection interval (sec)** Type the number of seconds that should elapse before it is determined that the primary Registrar is backed up. The default value is 240 seconds. This field is required if you select **Enable Failover and Fallback**.
    
> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you define the failure detection interval and the fallback detection interval, be careful not to enter an interval that will cause the failover and fallback to occur if the Registrar fails to respond for a short period of time. It is possible that the primary Registrar may not respond for short periods of time based on the loading of the pool or servers.
