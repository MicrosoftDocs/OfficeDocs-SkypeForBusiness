# Associate AV MCU With Front End
 
All Enterprise Edition Front End pools with Conferencing enabled must have an A/V Conferencing service collocated, or must use a stand-alone A/V Conferencing pool. Any existing Enterprise Edition Front End pools that currently have an A/V Conferencing service collocated may be selected to use this new stand-alone A/V Conferencing pool instead.
