# Add Director Association for Lync Server 2010
 
You define whether the Director or Director pool will have a Monitoring Server associated with it. Select the check box to associate a Monitoring Server with the Director or Director pool.
  
> [!TIP]
> If you have not yet created a Monitoring Server database (and optional instance), you will be given the opportunity to create it later if you select this check box to associate a Monitoring Server with the Director or Director pool.
