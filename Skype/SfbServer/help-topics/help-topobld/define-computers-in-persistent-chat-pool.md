Click **Update** to refresh the entries in the list of computers in the computers that make up the list of computers defined for the pool.
  
Click **Remove** to delete a defined computer in the pool.
  
Click **Back** to go back to the previous pool definition dialog.
  
Click **Next** after you have finished entering the computer members for this pool to proceed with the Persistent Chat Server pool definition.
  
Click **Cancel** to discard all changes and end the **Define New Persistent Chat Pool** wizard.
  
Click **Help** to access context sensitive help, such as this page.
