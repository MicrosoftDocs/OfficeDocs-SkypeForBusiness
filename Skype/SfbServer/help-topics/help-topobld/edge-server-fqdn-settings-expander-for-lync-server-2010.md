# Edge Server FQDN Settings Expander for Lync Server 2010
 
To define the properties under **External settings**, configure the following:
  
Select the **Enable separate FQDN and IP address for web conferencing and A/V** check box if you want to define distinct Pool FQDN and IP addresses for web conferencing and audio/video.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you choose to not select the check box for separate FQDN and IP addresses, you must provide distinct ports for each of the three services provided by the Edge Server. The only fully qualified domain name that is to configure is the FQDN associated with the Access Edge service. 
  
Select the **A/V Edge service is NAT enabled** check box if you want the A/V Edge service to use a network address translation (NAT) IP address and configuration.
  
For the enabled Edge services, you type a **Pool FQDN** and a port under **Ports**
  
- Define the **Access Edge service** Pool FQDN and a port that uniquely identifies the service.
    
- Define the **Web Conferencing Edge service** Pool FQDN (If Enable separate FQDN and IP address for web conferencing and A/V is not selected) and a port that uniquely identifies the service.
    
- Define the **A/V Edge service** Pool FQDN (If Enable separate FQDN and IP address for web conferencing and A/V is not selected) and a port that uniquely identifies the service.
    
  **OK** Accepts and commits changes to the dialog.
  
  **Cancel** Discards changes and closes the dialog.
  
  **Help** Displays this help screen.
