# Monitoring Server General Settings Expander
 
In Topology Builder, you can edit the properties for an individual Monitoring Server either by right-clicking the Monitoring Server in the console tree and then clicking **Action** in the toolbar, or by clicking a task in the Actions pane and then clicking **Edit Properties**, and changing any of the following options:
  
- **FQDN**, to change the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the server that you want to deploy as a Monitoring Server.
    
- **SQL store**, to change the instance of SQL Server to be used for the monitoring SQL Server database. If you change the SQL Server database of a Monitoring Server, you must restart the Monitoring Server for the change to take effect.
