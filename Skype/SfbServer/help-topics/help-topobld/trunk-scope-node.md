# Trunk Scope Node
 
You right click on an existing SIP trunk in Topology Builder to perform the following:
  
- **Edit Properties**: Starts the **Edit Properties** wizard used to edit or redefine the configuration of an existing SIP trunk
    
In addition to the Edit Properties option, you can perform the following general tasks:
  
- **Topology**. You can use this option to define a new topology, open an existing topology, download the current topology, save a copy of the topology, publish the topology, install a database, merge components from previous versions of Lync Server, or remove the deployment.
    
- **Delete** You use this selection to remove the currently selected item. Other dependencies may prevent the deletion. A dialog will indicate what services and dependencies need to be resolved before the item can be removed.
    
- **Help**. You can use this option to access Help for the active node.
