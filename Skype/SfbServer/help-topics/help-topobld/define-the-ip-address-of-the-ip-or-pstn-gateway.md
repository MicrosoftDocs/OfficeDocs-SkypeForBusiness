# Define the IP Address of the IP or PSTN Gateway

You define the IPv4 or IPv6 addresses for the IP or phone switched telephone network (PSTN) gateway by selecting either **Enable IPv4** or **Enable IPv6**. You can choose either **Use all configured IP addresses** or **Limit service usage to selected IP addresses**.

If you select **Use all configured IP addresses**, all addresses configured on the gateway will be used. Optionally, select **Limit service usage to selected IP addresses**, which enables the **PSTN IP address** entry. Enter the IPv4 or IPv6 address that has been assigned for this gateway.
