# SQL Store Settings Expander
 
To edit the properties of a SQL Server database, you must change the SQL Server database instance. You cannot use the **Edit Properties** dialog box to perform tasks such as moving your Archiving Server database from one computer to another. In addition, you cannot use the **Edit Properties** dialog box to change the instance of SQL Server that hosts the Central Management store.
  
## Editing the Properties of a SQL Server Database

To change the instance of SQL Server that is used by any database other than the Central Management store, complete the following procedure in Topology Builder:
  
### To modify an instance of SQL Server

1. Select the appropriate database under the **SQL stores** node, and then click **Edit Properties**.
    
2. In the **Edit Properties** dialog box, do one of the following:
    
   - To use the default SQL Server instance, select **Default Instance** and then click **OK**.
    
   - To use a named database instance, select **Named Instance**, enter the instance name in the text box, and then click **OK**. You should enter only the instance name (for example, ArchivingInstance), and not the entire SQL Server path.
    
When you are working in the **Edit Properties** dialog box, Topology Builder will not verify that the database instance that you have entered is a valid instance. For example, if you inadvertently typeArchivingInstanec as the instance name and then click **OK**, Topology Builder will accept that invalid instance. Before you can publish this topology, you must correct this mistake: if a SQL Server instance cannot be found, Topology Builder will not create that instance for you.
