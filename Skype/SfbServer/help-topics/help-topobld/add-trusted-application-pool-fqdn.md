# Add Trusted Application Pool FQDN
 
To define a Trusted Applications pool fully qualified domain name (FQDN), specify the following:
  
An FQDN of the server or pool of servers that will host the trusted applications.
  
Select **Multiple computer pool** if you are deploying a pool of servers for the trusted applications from load balancing and high availability, or select **Single computer pool** if you do not need load balancing or high availability.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> A single Trusted Applications Server cannot be converted to a pool of servers later. If you think you may need a pool in the future, you can deploy a multiple server pool containing a single computer now, and add servers when needed. 
  
For details about Trusted Applications pools, see [New-CsTrustedApplicationPool](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/new-cstrustedapplicationpool?view=skype-ps).
