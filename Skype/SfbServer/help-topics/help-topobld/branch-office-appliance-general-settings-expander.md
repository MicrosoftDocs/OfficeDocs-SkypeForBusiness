# Branch Office Appliance General Settings Expander

To edit the settings for an existing Survivable Branch Appliance or Survivable Branch Server, you are presented with the following sections:

- General settings

- Resiliency settings

- Mediation Server settings



For a Survivable Branch Appliance or Survivable Branch Server, you are presented with the following:

## General settings

The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the Survivable Branch Appliance or Survivable Branch Server. Edit the FQDN of the server to change the value. You must have a Domain Name System (DNS) host (A) record that coincides with the new value.

You can select to **Use all configured IP addresses** or to **Limit service usage to selected IP addresses**. If you select to **Limit the service to defined IP addresses**, you will define the primary IP address that the server will use for all communications, except for the public switched telephone network (PSTN) gateway. You define a separate IP address for PSTN usage.

In **Associations**, you can edit or specify the following:

- Associate Archiving Server enables you to select to associate an Archiving Server with the Survivable Branch Appliance or Survivable Branch Server. You can select from an already defined Archiving Server by selecting the server from the drop-down list, or click **New** to specify a new Archiving Server.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Before publishing the newly defined topology, the server that you specify must exist and must be joined to the domain.

- Associate Monitoring Server allows you to select to associate a Monitoring Server with the Survivable Branch Appliance or Survivable Branch Server. You can select from an already defined Monitoring Server by selecting the server from the drop-down list, or click **New** to specify a new Monitoring Server.

- Associate Edge pool enables you to select to associate an Edge Server or pool with the Survivable Branch Appliance or Survivable Branch Server. You can select from an already defined Edge Server or pool by selecting the server from the drop-down list, or click **New** to specify a new Edge Server or pool.

## Resiliency

Resiliency provides high availability for the Registrar pool. By providing a backup Registrar, if the primary Registrar fails, the backup Registrar can take over for the failed Registrar, enabling users to log on and communicate. There may be reduced functionality for users, depending on what systems have failed with the primary Registrar.

From the drop-down list, select the Enterprise Edition Front End pool or Standard Edition Front End Server that will act as the backup Registrar for the Survivable Branch Appliance or Survivable Branch Server. You can also select to enable Failover and Fallback time intervals. Enabling the failover and fallback time settings (specified in seconds) allows for the automatic detection of a failed Registrar, and a fallback time to allow for automatic determination that the primary is back up and can take over the Registrar process.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When defining the failure detection and the fallback interval, be careful not to enter an interval that will cause the failover and fallback to occur if the Registrar fails to respond for a short period of time. It is possible that the primary Registrar may not respond for short periods of time, based on the loading of the pool or servers. The default values for a Survivable Branch Appliance or a Survivable Branch Server in a site to a pool or Standard Edition Front End Server is 120 seconds for failover and 240 seconds for fallback.

## Mediation Server

For **Mediation Server** you can specify the following:

The check box for **Collocated Mediation Server enabled** is not available on a Survivable Branch Appliance or Survivable Branch Server because the Mediation Server is collocated.

You define the listening port on the pool servers for Transport Layer Security (TLS). By default, this port is 5067. If you select **Enable TCP port**, you must define a TCP port for the collocated Mediation Server. This is an optional setting, and you should refer to the requirements of your gateway or PSTN requirements to determine if you need this. By default, the TCP port value is 5068.

You define PSTN gateways that are associated with the collocated Mediation Server. If you have already defined gateways, they will be available to associate with the Mediation Server. If you have not defined any gateways, but you have them available to define, you can select **New**. You can also remove gateways that are already configured for this Mediation Server. Select the gateway, and then click **Remove**.

If you have more than one gateway associated with a Mediation Server, the first gateway associated will be the default gateway. If you must choose another gateway as the default gateway, select the gateway that you want to make the default, and click **Make Default**.
