# Associate Front End With Office Web Apps Server Page

The Office Web Apps Server provides services similar to a presenter uploading a document for use in a meeting, but enables additional features that the prior versions did not.

You select an Office Web Apps Server for your deployment if you have chosen Conferencing as one of your feature options for your Skype for Business Server 2015 configuration.

The options in this dialog present you with these choices:

1. **Associate pool with an Office Web Apps Server** - You select this check box if you will provide and deploy an Office Web Apps Server for your conferencing users.

2. If you have selected the check box, you use the list to select an already defined Office Web Apps Server.

3. Click **New** to define a new Office Web Apps Server for your deployment.
