# Edge Machine Settings Expander
 
To edit the properties for a server in a pool of Edge Servers, do the following:
  
The **Internal name or FQDN** can be changed by editing the fully qualified domain name (FQDN). The FQDN must match the Domain Name System (DNS) host (A) record, and the subject name of the certificate assigned to the server for the internal Edge network interface. The value of **Internal IP address** defines the IP address that is assigned the network interface that is defined as an internal network, relative to the perimeter network design.
  
The next three sections of the dialog define the IP addresses for the external configuration of this Edge Server. The ability to change the IP addresses is affected by the setting **Enable separate FQDN and IP address for web conferencing and A/V** on the Properties settings at the Edge Server pool level.
  
## SIP Access

Edit the external IP address that is assigned to the network interface for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) access. This IP address can either be a public IP address or an address in the private IP address range.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If the setting **Enable separate FQDN and IP address for web conferencing and A/V** on the pool settings page is enabled, only the IP address for SIP access will be available for editing.
  
## Web Conferencing

Edit the external IP address that is assigned to the network interface for web conferencing. This IP address can be either a public IP address or an address in the private IP address range.
  
## Audio/Video

Edit the external IP address that is assigned to the network interface for audio/video (A/V). This IP address can be either a public IP address or an address in the private IP address range.
  
The setting for **NAT enabled public IP address used** is the public address used by the external interface for either the A/V network interface or the Edge Server in general. If the setting **Enable separate FQDN and IP address for web conferencing and A/V** is enabled, this public IP address is used for all three external interfaces.
