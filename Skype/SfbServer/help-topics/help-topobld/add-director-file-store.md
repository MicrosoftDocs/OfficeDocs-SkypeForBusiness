# Add Director File Store

You must specify a file share to be used as the file store for Directors. You can use an existing file share for the file store, or you can specify a new file share by specifying the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the file server on which the file share is to be located and a folder name for the new file share.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you add Directors to a topology, topology publication requires appropriate access to set up the file store and configure discretionary access control lists (DACLs) on the file share to be used for the file store. This requires that, when you run Topology Builder and publish the new topology, you are logged on with an account that has full control permissions (read/write/modify) for the file share.

For details about storage support for file shares, see [File Storage Support](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ed66430d-3c19-4267-938c-956a51005073.aspx) in the Supportability documentation and [SQL Server Data and Log File Placement](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/67aa525b-8aa3-474f-827e-8e1d4697f30f.aspx) in the Deployment documentation. For details about collocation of the file share, see [Supported Server Collocation](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/3be990a1-5485-4b83-b73f-947ac97821f9.aspx) in the Supportability documentation.
