# Call Admission Control Settings Expander
 
Call admission control (CAC) is a network of regions, sites, and subnets that enable you to place restrictions on audio and video transmissions based on available bandwidth. After you configure the network for CAC, you must enable CAC in order for the bandwidth limitations to be enforced. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> You can also use control panel or the management shell cmdlets to enable CAC. 
  
In the **Call Admission Control Setting** section of the **Edit Properties** dialog box for your site, you can change the following settings:
  
- **Enable Call Admission Control** Select this setting to enable CAC. Clear this setting to disable CAC for your entire network. To enable CAC, you must have configured your network for CAC. For details, see [Deploy call admission control in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../deploy/deploy-enterprise-voice/deploy-call-admission-control.md) in the Deployment documentation.
    
- **Front End pool to run Call Admission Control** If you enabled CAC, you can change the pool that runs it. Select the pool from the drop-down list.
