# Select a Service

> [!NOTE] 
> Persistent chat is available in Skype for Business Server 2015 but is no longer supported in Skype for Business Server 2019. The same functionality is available in Teams. For more information, see [Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams upgrade](/MicrosoftTeams/upgrade-start-here). If you need to use Persistent chat, your choices are to either migrate users requiring this functionality to Teams or continue using Skype for Business Server 2015.
