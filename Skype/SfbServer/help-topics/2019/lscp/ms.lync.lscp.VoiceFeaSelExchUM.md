# Select Exchange UM Auto Attendant

> [!NOTE]
> Exchange UM remains available in Skype for Business Server 2019 when you integrate Skype for Business 2019 with Exchange 2013 or Exchange 2016. Due to changes in support in Exchange 2019, Exchange UM integration is being de-emphasised in favor of Cloud Voicemail and Cloud Auto Attendant features.  See [Plan Cloud Voicemail service](../../../../SfBServer2019/hybrid/plan-cloud-voicemail.md) [Plan Cloud Voicemail service] and [Plan for Skype for Business Server and Exchange Server migration](../../../../SfBServer2019/hybrid/plan-um-migration.md) (../../../SfBServer2019/hybrid/plan-um-migration.md) for more information.
 
Use the **Select Exchange UM Auto Attendant** dialog box to select an Exchange UM Auto Attendant that will handle incoming calls to a range of unassigned numbers.
  
In the search box, type all or part of the name of the Exchange UM Auto Attendant that you want to use. To return all available Exchange UM Auto Attendants, leave the search box empty and click the search icon.
  
In the list of Exchange UM Auto Attendants returned by the search, select the Auto Attendant you want to use to handle incoming calls to the range of unassigned numbers.
