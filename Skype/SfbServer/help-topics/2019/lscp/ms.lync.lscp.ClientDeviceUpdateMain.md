You can obtain the latest set of device update rules by going to the Help and Support page on the Microsoft website and searching for "Phone Edition."

For details, see [Import-CsDeviceUpdate](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/skype/import-csdeviceupdate?view=skype-ps).

After the device update rules have been imported, you can use the **Device Update** page to view and manage these rules for your organization's devices.
