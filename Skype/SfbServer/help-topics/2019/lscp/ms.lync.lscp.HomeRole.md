# Administrative Roles and Skype for Business Server Control Panel

To enable you to delegate administrative tasks while maintaining high standards for security, Skype for Business Server supports role-based access control (RBAC). With RBAC, you grant administrative privilege by assigning users to predefined administrative roles. Skype for Business Server includes a rich set of built-in administrative roles, and also enables you to create new roles and specify a custom list of cmdlets for each new role. You can also add scripts of cmdlets to the allowed tasks of both predefined and custom RBAC roles. For details, including the predefined administrative roles available in Skype for Business Server, see [Role-Based Access Control](/previous-versions/office/lync-server-2013/lync-server-2013-planning-for-role-based-access-control).
