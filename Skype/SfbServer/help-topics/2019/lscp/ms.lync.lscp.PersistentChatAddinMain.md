description: "You can use the Add-in section of the Persistent Chat page to associate URLs with Persistent Chat rooms. These URLs appear in the client in the chat room in the conversation extensibility pane. An administrator must add Add-ins to the list of registered add-ins, and chat room managers/Creators must associate rooms with one of the registered add-ins before users can see this upgrade in their client."

# Persistent Chat Add-in Main Page

> [!NOTE] 
> Persistent chat is available in Skype for Business Server 2015 but is no longer supported in Skype for Business Server 2019. The same functionality is available in Teams. For more information, see [Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams upgrade](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/journey-skypeforbusiness-teams). If you need to use Persistent chat, your choices are to either migrate users requiring this functionality to Teams or continue using Skype for Business Server 2015.
