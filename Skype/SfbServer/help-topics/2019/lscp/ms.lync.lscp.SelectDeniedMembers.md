description: "A Persistent Chat Administrator can create and manage chat room categories. As part of creating and managing chat room categories, a Persistent Chat Administrator can configure principals (Active Directory Domain Services groups/containers/users) that have access to be members/creators of chat rooms of a particular category. A Persistent Chat Administrator can also add DeniedMembers to a category and these become explicit exclusions to the allowed list. DeniedMembers override what's in AllowedMembers."

# Select Denied Members

> [!NOTE] 
> Persistent chat is available in Skype for Business Server 2015 but is no longer supported in Skype for Business Server 2019. The same functionality is available in Teams. For more information, see [Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams upgrade](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/journey-skypeforbusiness-teams). If you need to use Persistent chat, your choices are to either migrate users requiring this functionality to Teams or continue using Skype for Business Server 2015.
