description: "You can use the Persistent Chat Policy page of the Persistent Chat group to manage policies at a global, pool, site, or user level, including configuring the default global policy and creating one or more additional user and site policies for your deployment. If a user is enabled for Persistent Chat Server by policy, then the Persistent Chat Server environment appears in their client."

# Persistent Chat Policy Main Page

> [!NOTE] 
> Persistent chat is available in Skype for Business Server 2015 but is no longer supported in Skype for Business Server 2019. The same functionality is available in Teams. For more information, see [Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams upgrade](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/journey-skypeforbusiness-teams). If you need to use Persistent chat, your choices are to either migrate users requiring this functionality to Teams or continue using Skype for Business Server 2015.
