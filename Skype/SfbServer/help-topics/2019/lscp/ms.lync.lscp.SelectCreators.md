description: "Creating and managing Persistent Chat rooms is much easier with the correct use of categories. A Persistent Chat administrator can define AllowedMembers and Creators for each category, and can also define the default chat room settings and behaviors that will be applied to all chat rooms created in the category. Persistent Chat administrators create and manage categories by using Skype for Business Server Control Panel or Windows PowerShell cmdlets."

# Select Creators

> [!NOTE] 
> Persistent chat is available in Skype for Business Server 2015 but is no longer supported in Skype for Business Server 2019. The same functionality is available in Teams. For more information, see [Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams upgrade](/MicrosoftTeams/upgrade-start-here). If you need to use Persistent chat, your choices are to either migrate users requiring this functionality to Teams or continue using Skype for Business Server 2015.
