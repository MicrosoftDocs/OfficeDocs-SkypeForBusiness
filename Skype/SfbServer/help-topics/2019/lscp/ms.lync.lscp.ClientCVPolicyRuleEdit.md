  - **Allow and Upgrade** Allows the client to log on and receive updates from Windows Server Update Service or Microsoft Update. This action is available only when user agent **OC** is selected.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Selecting this action causes a notification to appear the next time users sign in to Skype for Business. The notification states that an update is available, even if updates have not yet been released to Windows Server Update Service or Microsoft Update. To avoid confusion, you should choose this action only after updates become available.

  - **Allow with URL** Allows the client to log on and displays a message about where to download another client version. You specify the URL in the **URL** field.

  - **Block** Prevents the client from logging on.

  - **Block and Upgrade** Prevents the client from logging on and allows the client to receive updates from Windows Server Update Service or Microsoft Update. This action is available only when user agent **OC** is selected.

  - **Block with URL** prevents the client from logging on and displays a message about where to download another client version. You specify the URL in the **URL** field.
