# Select Agents

Agents are users who are designated to answer Response Group calls. Response groups must have an assigned agent group that identifies the agents who can receive calls for the response group. One way to create an agent group is to define a custom group by selecting eligible users. Eligible users are enabled for Skype for Business Server and Enterprise Voice.

You use the **Select Agents** dialog box to select users to be added to an agent group.

## UI Reference

The following list describes the controls in the **Select Agents** dialog box.

- **Find** Searches for the SIP address or display name for a user. Enter all or part of the address or name. Leave the search box empty to display all users who are enabled for Skype for Business Server and Enterprise Voice.

- **Maximum users to display** Changes the number of returned results that are displayed. Use this counter to limit the search if you expect many results.

The following list describes the fields in the **Select Agents** dialog box.

- **Agent** Displays the user names returned by the search.

- **SIP address** Displays the user SIP addresses returned by the search.

- **Telephony** Displays the value of the **Telephony** field defined for users.

- **Enabled** Displays the value of the **Enabled for Lync Server** field defined for users.

For details about working with agent groups, see [Managing Agent Groups](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/36084cdc-38f1-4c45-922f-f81c7e86210c.aspx) in the Operations documentation.
