description: "Your Persistent Chat Server deployment can host many concurrent Persistent Chat rooms. Chat rooms can be organized into a set of categories on the server. Each chat room belongs to one category, and inherits some settings from that category. This organization creates a useful structure for identifying conversations, based on their business purpose, and facilitates delegated administration and simplified management."

# Persistent Chat Configuration Main Page

> [!NOTE] 
> Persistent chat is available in Skype for Business Server 2015 but is no longer supported in Skype for Business Server 2019. The same functionality is available in Teams. For more information, see [Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams upgrade](/MicrosoftTeams/upgrade-start-here). If you need to use Persistent chat, your choices are to either migrate users requiring this functionality to Teams or continue using Skype for Business Server 2015.
