# Edge Network (Planning Tool) in Skype for Business 
 
Most Edge components are deployed in a perimeter network. The following components make up the Edge topology of the perimeter network. Except where noted, the components are part of [Edge Server scenarios in Skype for Business Server](../../../plan-your-deployment/edge-server-deployments/scenarios.md) and are in the perimeter network. Edge components include the following:
  
- Edge Server(s)
    
- Reverse proxy
    
- Firewall
    
- Directors (optional, and logically located on the internal network)
    
- Load balancing for Scaled Edge Topologies (either DNS load balancing or a hardware load balancer)
