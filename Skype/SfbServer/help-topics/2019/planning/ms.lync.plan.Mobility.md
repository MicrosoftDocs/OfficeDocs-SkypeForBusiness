# Mobility (planning tool) in Skype for Business Server
 
The mobility feature in Skype for Business Server supports Skype for Business functionality on mobile devices.
  
Mobility functionality is the same in Skype for Business Server as in Lync Server 2013. For more details about preparing your environment for mobility, see [Planning for mobility in Lync Server 2013](/previous-versions/office/lync-server-2013/lync-server-2013-planning-for-mobility).
