# IP Version (Planning Tool)
 
You have three options when configuring IP addresses in Skype for Business Server. You can configure Skype for Business Server to support only IP version 4 (IPv4), only IP version 6 (IPv6), or a combination of both (known as a dual stack).
  
For more details about choosing your IP infrastructure, see [Plan for IPv6 in Skype for Business](../../../plan-your-deployment/network-requirements/ipv6.md).
