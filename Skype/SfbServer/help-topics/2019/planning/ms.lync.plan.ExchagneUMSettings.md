# Exchange Unified Messaging Settings (Planning Tool) in Skype for Business 2015

> [!NOTE]
> Exchange Unified Messaging as previously known is no longer available in Exchange 2019, but you can still use Phone System to record voicemail messages and then leave the recording in a user's Exchange mailbox. See [Plan Cloud Voicemail service](../../../../sfbhybrid/hybrid/plan-cloud-voicemail.md) for more information.

Skype for Business Server 2015 supports integration with Exchange Unified Messaging (UM) for combining voice messaging and email messaging into a single messaging infrastructure.
