> [!NOTE]
> Exchange Unified Messaging as previously known is no longer available in Exchange 2019, but you can still use Phone System to record voicemail messages and then leave the recording in a user's Exchange mailbox. See [Plan Cloud Voicemail service](../../../../SfBServer2019/hybrid/plan-cloud-voicemail.md) for more information.
