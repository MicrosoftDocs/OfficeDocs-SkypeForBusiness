# Request, Install, or Assign Certificates
 
 **Step 3: Request, Install or Assign Certificates** starts the Certificate Wizard when you click **Run**. The certificates that are configured through the wizard are based on the definition of the Skype for Business Server topology that is configured and published by Topology Builder to the Central Management store. To successfully run the Certificate Wizard for an online certification authority (CA) in your organization, you must be logged on to the computer as a user who is a member of the computer local administrators group. You must also be an authenticated Domain User in the domain where the computer and the CA exist. The certificate wizard does provide the ability to specify alternate credentials for access your organization's CA.
  
> [!NOTE]
> You can also use the Certificate Wizard to request and process offline certificate requests that are sent to a public CA or other offline public key infrastructure (PKI). There are no specific group memberships, other than those needed to log on to the computer, to generate an offline request. To process the public CA response and to assign the certificate to the computer and role, you must be logged on as a member of the local Administrators group or equivalent.
