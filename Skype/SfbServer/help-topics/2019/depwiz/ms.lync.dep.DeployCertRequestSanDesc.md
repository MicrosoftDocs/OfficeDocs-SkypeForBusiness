# Certificate Request (Subject Alternate Names)
 
The **Subject Name / Subject Alternative Names** page presents a summary of the subject name and all subject alternative names that will populate the certificate. The names presented for subject name and subject alternative names are gathered from the definition document, as it was created when you defined the deployment in Topology Builder.
  
If you must make changes to the subject name or any of the subject alternative names, click **Cancel** to exit the Certificate Request Wizard and rerun Topology Builder. Then republish the new configuration with the correctly defined subject and subject alternative names.
