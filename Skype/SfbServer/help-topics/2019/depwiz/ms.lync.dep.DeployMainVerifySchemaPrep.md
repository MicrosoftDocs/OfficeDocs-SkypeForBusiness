# Verify Replication of Schema Partition
 
To verify that the schema extension have been successfully replicated in your Active Directory Domain Services forest, do the following:
  
1. Log on to a domain controller (other than the domain controller that holds the schema master role) in your Active Directory Domain Services forest, where the schema extensions were applied as a member of the Enterprise Admins group.
    
2. Open ADSI Edit: Click **Start**, click **Administrative Tools**, and then click **ADSI Edit**.
    
    > [!TIP]
    > Alternatively, click **Start**, then click **Run**, type **adsiedit.msc** to start ADSI Edit.
  
3. In the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) tree, if it is not already selected, click ADSI Edit.
    
4. On the **Action** menu, click **Connect to**.
    
5. In the **Connection Settings** dialog box under **Select a well known Naming Context**, select **Schema**, and then click **OK**.
    
6. Under the schema container, search for CN=ms-RTC-SIP-SchemaVersion. If this object exists, and the value of the **rangeUpper** attribute is 1150 and the value of the **rangeLower** attribute is 3, then the schema was successfully updated and replicated. If this object does not exist or if the values of the **rangeUpper** and **rangeLower** attributes are not as specified, then the schema was not modified or has not replicated.
    
> [!NOTE]
> If your check of the replication of the schema does not yet show a successful replication, wait approximately 15 minutes and then check again. Active Directory replication is based on a loose consistency model and some replication latency can occur, based on a number of factors in the server and infrastructure.
