# SQL Server Reporting Services (Groups)

In the **Specify Read-Only Group**, specify the group to whom you want to grant read-only access to Monitoring reports. Use the format &lt;domain&gt;\\&lt;access group&gt;. For example: contoso\RTCUniversalReadOnlyAdmins.
  
Assigning a group read-only access is optional. If you do not want to grant read-only access now, you can configure it later directly in SQL Server Reporting Services.
