# Prepare Schema (Invoke)
 
The **Executing Commands** page displays a summary of the commands that are issued to extend the schema for Skype for Business Server. When the tasks are complete, the summary pane will indicate if the tasks were successful or if they failed. Review the summary screen, and make sure that **Task status: Completed** is displayed under the summary pane. The drop-down list under the summary pane enables you to select and view the log file, Prepare Schema. Click **View Log** to review the log file. If you received errors during the schema preparation, the errors that the task encountered are logged here. You can then take action to correct any error and re-run the schema preparation.
