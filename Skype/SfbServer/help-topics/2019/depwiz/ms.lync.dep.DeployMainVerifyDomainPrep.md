# Verify Replication in the Domain
 
To verify replication of the domain preparation accomplished in **Step 1: Prepare Schema**, it is necessary to run a cmdlet from the Skype for Business Server Management Shell Lync Server Management Shell. To run the Windows PowerShell cmdlet, log on to a computer that is a member of the domain that you have prepared, and as a member of the Domain Admins group. Do the following:
  
1. Start the Skype for Business Server Management Shell: Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Skype for Business**, and then click **Skype for Business Server Management Shell**.
    
2. In Windows PowerShell, type the following:
    
   ```
   Get-CsAdDomain [-Domain <Fqdn>] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [-GlobalCatalog <Fqdn>] [-GlobalSettingsDomainController <Fqdn>]
   ```

    For example:
    
   ```
   Get-CsAdDomain -Domain domain1.contoso.net -GlobalSettingsDomainController dc01.domain1.contoso.com
   ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The parameter GlobalSettingsDomainController enables you to indicate where global settings are stored. If your settings are stored in the System container (which is typical with upgrade deployments that have not had the global setting migrated to the Configuration container), you define a domain controller in the root of your Active Directory Domain Services forest. If the global settings are in the Configuration container (which is typical with new deployments or upgrade deployments where the settings have been migrated to the Configuration container), you define any domain controller in the forest. If you do not specify this parameter, the cmdlet assumes that the settings are stored in the Configuration container and refers to any domain controller in Active Directory. 
  
    If you do not specify the Domain parameter, the value is set to the local domain. This cmdlet returns a value of **LC_DOMAIN_SETTINGS_STATE_READY** if domain preparation was successful.
