# Topology Builder Startup Dialog
 
You start Topology Builder to configure the properties and configuration of your deployment. On startup, Topology Builder displays a dialog that asks what the source of the topology document will be. You select one of three options:
  
- **Download Topology from existing deployment** Select this option if you have run Topology Builder and have successfully published your topology to the Central Management Server. This option requests and downloads a local copy of the current configuration, allowing you to edit and configure the existing deployment.
    
- **Open Topology from a local file** Select this option if you are configuring a deployment but have not yet published the configuration. This option allows you to save a local copy of the configuration work in Topology Builder and come back to it at a later time.
    
- **New Topology** Select this option to begin the configuration of a new topology document. This option opens a new topology document that you configure to meet the requirements for the deployment that you will configure.
