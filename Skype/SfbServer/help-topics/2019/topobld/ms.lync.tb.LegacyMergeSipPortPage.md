# Legacy Merge SIP Port
 
The default Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) SIP port for communicating with clients, legacy Front End pools, and servers is 5061. If the default value was not used, select **SIP port for all pools and servers:** and enter the new value.
  
If your legacy deployment is configured for Automatic Client sign-in, select **Automatic discovery of SIP port configuration for each pool** and click **Next** to continue.
