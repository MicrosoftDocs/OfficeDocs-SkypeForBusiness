# Add Edge Server Associations
 
Use this page to select which Front End pools and Standard Edition servers will use this Edge pool for A/V traffic. 
  
Each Front End pool can be associated with only one Edge pool. If you select a pool that is already associated with another Edge pool, it will change the association away from the previous Edge pool.
  
You can also choose to associate this Edge Server or Edge pool with Mediation Servers or Mediation Server pools to configure and enable Enterprise Voice for external users.
