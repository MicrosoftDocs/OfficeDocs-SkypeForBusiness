# PSTN Gateway Settings Expander
 
To edit or modify the settings for a public switched telephone network (PSTN) gateway, modify the following fields:
  
Gateway FQDN or IP Address is a required entry and defines wither the **Fully qualified domain name (FQDN)** of the PSTN gateway as defined by a Domain Name System (DNS) host (A) record, a static HOSTS file entry, or by the IP address of the PSTN gateway.
  
The SIP Transport Protocol can either be Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS is the default. Refer to the gateway vendor documentation for what you gateway supports. The default is TLS, and should be considered the more secure selection, if the gateway supports TLS.
  
Select whether to enable IPv4 and IPv6 for the gateway.
  
The **Alternate media IP address** is a definition for the Mediation Server for which the deployed PSTN gateway has a different IP address for media traffic than the default configured IP address, which is typically dedicated for SIP traffic. If you define this parameter, then the PSTN gateway supports a different supports a different network interface or path for media. If this address is left blank, then the PSTN gateway does not support the alternate path for media.
