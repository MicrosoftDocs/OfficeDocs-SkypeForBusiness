# Add Director Monitoring
 
You can **Define the Monitoring SQL Server store** by configuring the following properties:
  
- **Monitoring SQL Server store**: Select a SQL Server fully qualified domain name (FQDN) (and, optionally, a named SQL Server instance) from the list.
    
    Click **New** to create a new SQL Server FQDN definition, and optionally, an instance name for the Monitoring Server store.
    
- Select the **Enable SQL Server store mirroring** check box if you want to add database mirroring for the Monitoring Server.
    
    Select an existing **Monitoring SQL Server store mirror** from the list.
    
    Click **New** to create a new SQL Server FQDN definition, and optionally, an instance name for the mirror store.
    
- If you selected **Enable SQL Server store mirroring**, optionally select **Use SQL Server mirroring witness to enable automatic failover** to select a SQL Server mirroring witness store from the list.
    
    Click **New** to create a new SQL Server FQDN definition, and optionally, an instance name for the mirroring witness store.
    
Click **Back** to go back to the previous pool definition dialog.
  
Click **Next** after you have finished entering the options for this dialog to proceed with the configuration.
  
Click **Cancel** to discard all changes and end the wizard.
  
Click **Help** to access context-sensitive help, such as this page.
