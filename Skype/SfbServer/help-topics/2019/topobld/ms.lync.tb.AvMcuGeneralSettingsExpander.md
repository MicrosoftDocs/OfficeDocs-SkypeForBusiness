# AV MCU General Settings Expander
 
To edit the properties for an A/V Conferencing Server pool that you have already defined, you can do the following:
  
## General settings

Update the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the A/V Conferencing Server pool by typing in the name of the pool, as it is defined in the Domain Name System (DNS).
  
## A/V Conferencing service

To associate an A/V Conferencing Server pool, select the Front End pool or pools that you have to associate with the A/V Conferencing Server pool.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If no Front End pools are displayed in the **Select the Front End pools to associate with this A/V Conferencing pool** pane, you have either collocated the A/V Conferencing Server with the Front End pool or did not select to add Conferencing in the **Features and functionality** section of the Front End pool properties.
  

When finished, click **OK** to complete the editing of the A/V Conferencing Server pool settings. Click **Cancel** to discard any changes.
