# Skype for Business Server Root Scope Node
 
The **Lync Server** node lists the central sites in your topology. You can perform the following actions:
  
- **New Central Site**. Starts the Define New Central Site wizard, which you use to add a new central site to the topology.
    
- **Edit Properties**. Enables you to edit settings that affect your whole topology, such as supported Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) domains and simple URLs.
    
- **New Topology**. Enables you to start creating a new topology for your deployment. This option is useful when you are planning your deployment, before you have installed your servers. Do not click this option if you have already used your current topology to install your deployment.
    
- **Open Topology**. Opens a topology file that you have saved.
    
- **Download Topology**. Loads your current deployed topology from the Central Management store. If you have already defined a topology and established the Central Management store, you should always choose this option to load your topology.
    
- **Save a Copy of Topology As**. Saves the current topology to a file that you can load again later in Topology Builder.
    
- **Publish Topology**. Use this option to publish this topology to the Central Management store, so that you can begin deploying your servers.
    
- **Install Database**. Enables you to create the databases necessary for your deployment.
    
- **Merge Office Communications Server 2007 R2 Topology**. Starts the Topology Builder Merge wizard. This tool collects information about your previous Office Communications Server environment, including Edge Server information, and publishes that information to a shared database. 
    
- **Remove Deployment**. Starts the Remove Deployment wizard, which enables you to start removing your whole deployment.
    
In addition to these options, you can perform the following general tasks:
  
- **View**. You can use this option to customize the view of Topology Builder by selecting the items to show and hide in the console tree views.
    
- **Help**. You can use this option to access Help for the active node.
