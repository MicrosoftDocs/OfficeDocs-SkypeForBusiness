# Add Front End Server Collocations

For an Enterprise Edition deployment, the A/V Conferencing service is collocated on the Front End pool. You can also collocate the Mediation Server on the Front End pool, or you can deploy it as a stand-alone server. The A/V Conferencing service is always collocated if conferencing is enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> An A/V Conferencing service is required if **Conferencing** was selected on the **Select features** page. An Enterprise Edition Front End pool uses a collocated A/V Conferencing service. If Conferencing was not selected, the Collocate A/V Conferencing service will not be available.

You can collocate the Mediation Server role on a Standard Edition Front End Server or Enterprise Edition Front End pool. If you deploy Direct SIP connections to a qualified public switched telephone network (PSTN) gateway that supports media bypass and Domain Name System (DNS) load balancing, a stand-alone Mediation Server pool is not necessary. A stand-alone Mediation Server pool is not necessary because qualified gateways are capable of DNS load balancing to a pool of Mediation Servers and they can receive traffic from any Mediation Server in a pool. We also recommend that you collocate the Mediation Server on a Front End pool when you have deployed IP-PBXs or connect to an Internet Telephony Server Provider's Session Border Controller (SBC), as long as any of the following conditions are met:

- The IP-PBX or SBC is configured to receive traffic from any Mediation Server in the pool and can route traffic uniformly to all Mediation Servers in the pool.

- The IP-PBX or SBC is configured to receive traffic from any Mediation Server in the pool and can route traffic uniformly to all Mediation Servers in the pool.

You can use the Planning Tool to evaluate whether the Front End pool where you want to collocate the Mediation Server can handle the load. If your environment cannot meet these requirements, then you must deploy a stand-alone Mediation Server pool.

In general, collocation of Mediation Server is not recommended if your organization has high availability and scalability requirements. For details about collocating these server roles in a Front End pool in an Enterprise Edition deployment, see [Define and Configure a Front End Pool](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/713fc263-23dd-414a-b001-82932e4fe966.aspx) in the Deployment documentation.
