# Add Simple URL
 
To add additional simple URLs to the definition of the deployment, specify the URL of the new simple URL. The format of the URL is  _http://\<simple URL type\>.\<domain name\>_ or _http://\<domain name\>/\<simple URL type\>_, where the simple URL type is one of the following:
  
- Meet
    
- Dial in
    
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can have one Dial in simple URL and one Meet simple URL active at any time. Adding a new simple URL and making it the active URL will set all future requests to use the new simple URL. You leave the nonactive simple URL to handle conferences and other requests that were made when the older simple URL was active.
