# File Store Settings Expander
 
To edit the properties of the defined file stores:
  
For the File Share name, you can define the name of a new share. You must then create the share on the server that is named in the File Server fully qualified domain name (FQDN) property.
  
> [!NOTE]
> You cannot change the FQDN of the server that is specified in the File Server FQDN property. If you need to place the file store file share on a different server, you create a new file store entry.
