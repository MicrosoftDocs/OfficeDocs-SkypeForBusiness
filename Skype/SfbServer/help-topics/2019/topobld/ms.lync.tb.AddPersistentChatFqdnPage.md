description: "You create a new Persistent Chat Server or Persistent Chat Server pool using the Define New Persistent Chat Pool wizard. Select either a Multiple computer pool or a Single computer pool. If you select a single computer pool and later need a multiple computer pool, you will need to remove the single computer pool and then define a multiple computer pool."

# Define Persistent Chat FQDN

> [!NOTE] 
> Persistent chat is available in Skype for Business Server 2015 but is no longer supported in Skype for Business Server 2019. The same functionality is available in Teams. For more information, see [Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams upgrade](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/upgrade-start-here). If you need to use Persistent chat, your choices are to either migrate users requiring this functionality to Teams or continue using Skype for Business Server 2015.
