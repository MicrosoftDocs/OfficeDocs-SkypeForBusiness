# Director General Settings Expander
 
To edit the settings for an existing Director, you are presented with the following sections:
  
- General settings
    
- Web services
    

## General settings

Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the Director pool. Edit the FQDN of the server to change the value. You must have a Domain Name System (DNS) host (A) record that coincides with the new value.
  
In **Associations** you can edit or specify the following:
  
File share for the Director pool to use. Select an existing file share that has already been defined in Topology Builder, or click **New** to create a new file share definition.
  
Monitoring SQL Server store.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before publishing the newly defined topology, the server that you specify must exist and be joined to the domain. If you created a new file share, the file share must be created on the server that you designate. 
  
## Web services

To edit or specify additional settings for the Web services on the Director pool, you modify or specify settings in the Internal Web services and External Web services.
  
For **Internal web services** you can specify the following:
  
> [!CAUTION]
> If you have more than one Front End pool or Front End Server the external Web services FQDN must be unique. For example, if you define the external Web services FQDN of a Front End Server as **pool01.contoso.com**, you cannot use **pool01.contoso.com** for another Front End pool or Front End Server. If you are also deploying Directors, the external Web services FQDN defined for any Director or Director pool must be unique from any other Director or Director pool as well as any Front End pool or Front End Server. If you decide to override the Internal web services with a self-defined FQDN, each FQDN must be unique from any other Front End pool, Director or a Director pool.
  
If you select Override FQDN, you can specify a different FQDN for the Internal Web services identity on the pool. By default, the setting is the current pool name as defined for the Director pool.
  
You can specify listening and published ports for HTTP and HTTPS that your deployment requires. The default setting of port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS are the most common settings and typically do not need to be changed unless you have specific requirements within your organization and infrastructure design.
  
For **External web services**, you can specify the following:
  
You can define the FQDN of the External Web services. The FQDN specified here will usually be defined by the requirements of your external connection requirements, such as the reverse proxy.
  
You can specify listening and published ports for HTTP and HTTPS that your deployment requires. The default settings of port 8080 for HTTP and port 4443 for HTTPS are defined initially. You change these settings for the listening ports based on what the requirements are for your reverse proxy and external network requirements. The published ports are set to default of port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS. These values determine what ports the Director pool or Director server will listen for incoming requests. Typically, these do not need to be changed, unless there is conflict of port requirements on the pool. Internal and external published ports that use the same port values are expected. This is not a conflict.
