# Archiving Servers Scope Node
 
In Topology Builder, you can perform tasks related to an individual Archiving Server by either right-clicking the **Archiving Server** in the console tree, clicking **Action** in the toolbar, or clicking a task in the Actions pane, and then clicking the following Archiving Server option.
  
- **New Archiving Server**. Starts the **Define New Archiving Server** wizard, where you specify the settings for a new Archiving Server, including the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), archiving SQL Server database, archiving file store, and pool association.
    
> [!NOTE]
> The Archiving Servers node contains an Archiving Server, if you have previously added an Archiving Server to the topology in Topology Builder. However, instant messaging or web conferencing (messaging) cannot be archived until you also set up the Archiving Server, which includes installing Skype for Business Server on the server that you want to use as an Archiving Server and configuring support for archiving. 
  
In addition to the Archiving Server options described earlier in this topic, you have general options from the Archiving Servers node that are also available from other nodes in the console tree. These include the following options:
  
- **Topology**. Use this option to define a new topology, open an existing topology, download the current topology, save a copy of the topology, publish the topology, install a database, merge components, or remove the deployment.
    
- **View**. Use this option to customize the view of in Topology Builder by selecting the items to show and hide in the console tree views.
    
- **Help**. Use this option to access Help for the active node.
