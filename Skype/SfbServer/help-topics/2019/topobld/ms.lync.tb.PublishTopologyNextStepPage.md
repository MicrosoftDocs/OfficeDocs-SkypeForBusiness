# Publish Topology Next Step

At the completion of the publishing of the topology, the **Publish wizard complete** page is displayed.

As you finish steps during the Publish Topology process, logs are created that contain information about the tasks that were performed. To view a log file related to a given step, select the step that you need to review the log file for, and then click **View Logs**.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all steps during the Publish Topology process will have associated log files. If you select a step and **View Logs** is available, this step has created a log file. If the **View Logs** button is not available (grayed out), no log file was created for this step.

To review Next Steps suggested to complete your topology, click the link **Click here to open to-do list**. The text file that is opened by clicking this link will indicate the servers that you will have to run local setup, and any additional steps that you need to take to complete your deployment. For each of the tasks listed, refer to the appropriate section in the Deployment documentation.

Click **Finish**
