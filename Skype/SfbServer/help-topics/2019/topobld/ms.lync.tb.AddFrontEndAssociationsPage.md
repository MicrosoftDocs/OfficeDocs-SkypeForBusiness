# Add Front End Associations

You can enable support for specific features that require the deployment of other servers by associating the server roles with the Front End pool now. You can also associate server roles with the Front End pool at a later time. The server roles that can be associated with a Front End pool include the following:

- A/V Edge Server. For details about the implementation of an A/V Edge Server, see [Planning for Conferencing](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/983a272a-e1b3-4d70-8f84-836b092fe526.aspx) in the Planning documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you enable support for any of these features now, the topology design that you publish will include the server components that are required to implement each selected feature. For the publishing of a topology to succeed without error, you must have the physical computers joined to the domain. For example, if you enable support for archiving now, you must then deploy an Archiving Server and configure the appropriate archiving options before you start archiving communications for your organization.
