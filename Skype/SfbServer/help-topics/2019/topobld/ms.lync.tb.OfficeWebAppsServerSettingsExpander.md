# Edit Office Web Apps Server Settings

You edit the properties of the configured Office Web Apps Server. The following properties are available to edit:

 **Office Web Apps Server FQDN**: This property defines the fully qualified domain name of the Office Web Apps Server and should match a domain name system (DNS) host A or AAAA (if IPv6 is being used) record.

 **Office Web Apps Server discovery URL**: The uniform resource locator (URL) for client access to the Office Web Apps Server, you may need to edit this address from its default if the server is placed in another network zone other than the internal network for your deployment.

Select the check box **Office Web Apps Server is deployed in an external network** if this server is deployed in your perimeter network or other network zone that is outside of your internal firewall separating the perimeter network, less trusted networks, and the Internet from your internal deployment.
