# Simple URL Settings Expander

To specify new, remove existing, or to change the active the simple URLs, do the following:

## Simple URLs

To modify or define the simple URLs, first decide which of the three simple URLs that you want to edit or change. You can choose from the Phone access URL, the Meeting URL, and the Administrative access URL.

To modify either the Phone access URL or the Meeting URL, select the URL that you need to change. Click **Edit URL**. Edit the URL, and click **OK** to save the URL. Click **Cancel** to discard any changes.

To add a new URL, click **Add**. In the **Add simple URL** dialog, specify the URL, and then click **OK** to save the URL. Select **Make this the active URL for the selected domain** if you need to set the new URL as the active URL. Click **Cancel** to discard any changes.

To make a different URL the active URL (as noted by the green check mark next to the URL), select the URL and click **Make Active**.

> [!NOTE]
> There can only be one active URL for each Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) domain.

To remove a URL, select the URL and click **Remove**.

> [!CAUTION]
> Be sure to read the information on the simple URLs settings dialog page. Removing a Meeting URL can render existing meetings scheduled by users no longer accessible. Consider leaving the existing URL after making the new Meeting URL active. When you are sure that users are no longer using the old Meeting URL, you can safely remove it.

To edit or change the Administrative access URL, edit the entry.

After you are finished with all changes on the Edit Properties page, click **OK** to save the changes. Click **Cancel** to discard changes.
