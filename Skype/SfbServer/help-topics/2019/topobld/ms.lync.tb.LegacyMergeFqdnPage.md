# Legacy Merge FQDN
 
The **Access Edge Pool internal FQDN** is used for a variety of scenarios where internal users communicate with external users for federation, remote user access, and public IM connectivity. If a load-balanced Edge Server was deployed in your legacy environment, enter the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the internal load balancer.
  
The **Internal SIP access port** value of **5061** is the default Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) SIP port for communicating with clients, legacy Front End pools and servers. If the default value was not used, update the **Internal SIP access port:** value.
