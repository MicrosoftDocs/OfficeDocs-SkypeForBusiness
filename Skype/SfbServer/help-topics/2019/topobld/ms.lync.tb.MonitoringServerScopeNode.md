# Monitoring Scope Node
 
In Topology Builder, you can perform tasks related to an individual server running Monitoring by either right-clicking the server running Monitoring in the console tree, clicking **Action** in the toolbar, or clicking a task in the Actions pane, and then clicking one of the following options for the server running Monitoring:
  
- **Edit Properties**. Opens the **Edit Properties** page for the server running Monitoring, where you can change the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the server running Monitoring or the monitoring SQL Server database.
    
- **Delete**. Deletes the server running Monitoring from the topology and the monitoring SQL Server database.
    
In addition to the options for the server running Monitoring that are described earlier in this topic, you have general options from the Monitoring node that are also available from other nodes in the console tree. This includes the following options:
  
- **Topology**. You can use this option to define a new topology, open an existing topology, download the current topology, save a copy of the topology, publish the topology, install a database, or remove the deployment.
    
- **Help**. You can use this option to access Help for the active node.
