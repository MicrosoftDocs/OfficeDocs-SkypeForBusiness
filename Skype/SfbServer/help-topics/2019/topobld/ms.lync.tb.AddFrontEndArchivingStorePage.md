description: "Archiving requires a supported 64-bit edition of the Microsoft SQL Server database software to store the archiving data. You can either select a previously defined SQL Server database to be used for archiving, or define a new SQL Server database by specifying a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the server on which the SQL Server database is to reside, in addition to the instance of SQL Server that you want to use for the new SQL Server database (which can be the default instance, or a named instance that you specify)."

# Add Front End Archiving Store

Archiving requires a supported 64-bit edition of the Microsoft SQL Server database software to store the archiving data. You can either select a previously defined SQL Server database to be used for archiving, or define a new SQL Server database by specifying a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the server on which the SQL Server database is to reside, in addition to the instance of SQL Server that you want to use for the new SQL Server database (which can be the default instance, or a named instance that you specify).

> [!NOTE]
> If the account used to publish the topology has the appropriate user rights and permissions, you can create the monitoring database when you publish your topology. You can also create the database later, included as part of the installation procedure.

> [!NOTE]
> To install and deploy the databases on the SQL Server-based server for monitoring, you must be a member of the SQL Server sysadmins group for the SQL Server-based server where you are installing the database files. If you are not a member of the SQL Server sysadmin group, you must request that you be added to the group until the database files are deployed. If you cannot be made a member of the sysadmins group, you should provide your SQL Server database administrator with the script to configure and deploy the databases. For details about the user rights and permissions that you need to accomplish the procedures, see [Deployment Permissions for SQL Server](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/56ea0c02-bcf5-4d45-aa13-570531c29074.aspx) in the Deployment documentation.
