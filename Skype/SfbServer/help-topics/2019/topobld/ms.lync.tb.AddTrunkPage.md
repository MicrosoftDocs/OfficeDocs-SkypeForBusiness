# Define a New Trunk

You define a new session initiation protocol (SIP) trunk by providing the following information:

- **Trunk name**: unique name in your topology that will identify this trunk

- **Associated PSTN Gateway**: select a deployed and configured PSTN gateway in your deployment from the list

- **Listening port for the IP/PSTN gateway**: port that the IP-PBX or PSTN gateway will listen on. Must be unique from all other trunk listening ports configured in your deployment

- **SIP Transport Protocol**: select from the list either TCP or TLS

- **Associated Mediation Server**: select from the list a Mediation Server that is deployed and configured in your deployment

- **Associated Mediation Server port**: set the port value equal to the TCP or TLS port value of the Mediation Server that this SIP trunk will use
