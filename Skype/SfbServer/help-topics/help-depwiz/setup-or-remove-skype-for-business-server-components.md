# Setup or Remove Skype for Business Server Components
 
To install and activate, or deactivate or uninstall Skype for Business Server 2015 components, you use **Step 2: Setup or Remove Skype Server Components**. You must be logged in as a local administrator on the computer that you are installing or modifying and must be able to read Active Directory Domain Services users and groups in the current domain. To begin, click **Run**. When you do this, the Central Management store-based topology definition is read. Necessary software components are installed and configured, according to the role as defined in the Central Management store. When the installation is complete, review the Summary, and click **Finish**.
  
> [!TIP]
> If you need to review the log files that are created by the Deployment Wizard, you can find them on the computer where the Deployment Wizard was run, in the Users directory of the Active Directory user who ran the step. For example, if the user logged in as the domain administrator in the domain Contoso.net, the log files are located in: > C:\Users\Administrator.Contoso\AppData\Local\Temp 
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you have previously installed Skype for Business Server 2015 components on this computer, the Deployment Wizard will recognize this, and the button in step 2 will be displayed as **Run Again**. This enables you to run the step as many times as needed to correctly configure or modify the server.
