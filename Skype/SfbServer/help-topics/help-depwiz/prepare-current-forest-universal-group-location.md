# Prepare Current Forest (Universal Group Location)
 
You must indicate where you need to create the universal groups in the forest. The **Universal Group Location** page uses the domain in which the computer that you are logged on to is a member of as the default. If you would prefer to create the universal groups in a domain other than the default **Local domain**, select **Domain FQDN** and type the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in the text box. Providing an alternate domain is helpful when you are running the forest preparation task from a domain other than where you want the universal groups be created. Click **Next** to continue.
