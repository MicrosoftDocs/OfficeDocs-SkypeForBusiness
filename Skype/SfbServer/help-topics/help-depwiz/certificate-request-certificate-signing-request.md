# Certificate Request (Certificate Signing Request)
 
To create an offline request, you must first create a certificate signing request (CSR). Type the path and file name for the CSR in the **File Name** text box. You can click **Browse** to choose a location to create the CSR. Click **Next** to continue.
  
Click **Back** to go back to the previous screen. Click **Cancel** to exit without making changes to the system.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The file that is created in this step is sent to your public certification authority (CA), to your internal offline CA, or submitted to your CA administrator for processing. Note the file location and name so that you can retrieve it and submit the CSR to the CA. The default location is the Documents directory of the person running the Certificate Wizard.
