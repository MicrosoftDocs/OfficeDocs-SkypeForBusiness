# Prepare Active Directory

To begin the installation of Skype for Business Server 2015, you must prepare the Active Directory Domain Services schema, forest, and domains that will host servers and users. The Skype for Business Server Deployment Wizard will guide you through the steps required to prepare Active Directory, beginning with the schema and then into the forest preparation. After confirming that Active Directory replication is successful, you then prepare each domain that will host users or servers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To successfully prepare the schema, you must be logged in as a member of the Enterprise Admins group and the Schema Admins group. To prepare the forest, you must be logged in as a member of the Enterprise Admins group or logged in as the administrator in the forest root. For domain preparation, you must be logged in as a member of the Domain Admins group.
