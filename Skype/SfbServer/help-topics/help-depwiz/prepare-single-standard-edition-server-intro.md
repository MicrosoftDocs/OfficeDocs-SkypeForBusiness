# Prepare Single Standard Edition Server (Intro)
 
To begin the installation of a Skype for Business Server 2015 Standard Edition server that will hold the Central Management store and other collocated services that you select, you must be logged in as a member of the local Administrators group on the server that will become the Standard Edition server. The **Prepare single Standard Edition Server** page details the requirements for the initial install. The computer must be a member of the domain in which you are going to deploy it, and you must have successfully completed the Schema, Forest, and Domain prep for your forest.
  
This particular task is designed to set up a Standard Edition server as the first server in your infrastructure. This task installs the Central Management store, which is SQL Server Express, onto the Standard Edition server. If you already have another Standard Edition server or Front End pool deployed, you should click **Cancel**.
  
> [!NOTE]
> After completing this task, you will install Topology Builder (if you have not already installed it) and configure your topology document. You cannot publish your topology document until you have a Central Management store availableâ€”which is deployed by completing the task described in this topic.
