## Tips for printing large-format posters
<a name="tips"> </a>

If you have a plotter, you can print large posters in their full size. If you don't have plotter, use the following steps to print on smaller paper such as 11"x17". Printing a large format poster on smaller paper may make the text difficult or impossible to read.
  
### Print posters on smaller paper

1. Open the poster in Visio.
    
2. On the **File** menu, click **Page Setup**.
    
3. On the **Print Setup** tab, in the **Printer paper** section, select the size of paper you want to print on.
    
4. On the **Print Setup** tab, in the **Print zoom** section, click **Fit to**, and then enter **1 sheet across by 1 sheet down**.
    
5. On the **Page Size** tab, click **Size to fit drawing contents**, and then click **OK**. 
    
6. On the **File** menu, click **Print**.
