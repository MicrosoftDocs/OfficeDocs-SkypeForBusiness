Reset-CcCACertificate
```

## Detailed Description

If the root CA certificate is compromised or no longer secure, you must update the root CA certificate, and all certificates issued by the root CA. The Reset-CcCACertificate cmdlet revokes all certificates, uninstalls and reinstalls the Certificate Authority, and then cleans up all certificates related to the old Certification Authority service. 
  
For more information, see "Certificate authority certificates or internal certificates issued to CMS, Mediation Server, and Edge Server are near expiration or are compromised" in Troubleshooting your Cloud Connector deployment.
