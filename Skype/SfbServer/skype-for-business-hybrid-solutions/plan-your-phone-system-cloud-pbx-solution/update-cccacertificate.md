# Update-CcCACertificate
 
The Update-CcCACertificate cmdlet renews the Skype for Business Cloud Connector Edition root CA certificate that is near expiration or already expired. 
  
```
Update-CcCACertificate
```

## Parameters

None.
  
## Examples
<a name="Examples"> </a>

### Example 1

The following example renews the root CA certificate: 
  
```
Update-CcCACertificate 
```

## Detailed Description
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

The Cloud Connector root CA certificate is valid for five years from the date that the Certificate Authority service is installed.
  
If the root certificate is near expiration or already expired, run the Update-CcCACertificate cmdlet to renew the certificate. After the root certificate is renewed, the AD Server, Central Management Store, and Edge Server will be issued new certificates automatically.
  
If there are multiple appliances in the same PSTN site, run the Update-CcCACertificate cmdlet in all appliances of the same PSTN site.
  
As the last step, run Export-CcRootCertificate to export the root certificate to a local file in the first appliance, then copy and install the exported certificate to your PSTN gateways.
  
This command replaces the Renew-CcCACertificate cmdlet in Cloud Connector 2.0 and later releases.
  
## Input Types
<a name="InputTypes"> </a>

None. The Update-CcCACertificate cmdlet does not accept pipelined input.
  
## Return Types
<a name="ReturnTypes"> </a>

None.
