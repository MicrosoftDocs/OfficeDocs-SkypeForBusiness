# Validate your Cloud Connector deployment

> [!Important]
> Cloud Connector Edition will retire July 31, 2021 along with Skype for Business Online. Once your organization has upgraded to Teams, learn how to connect your on-premises telephony network to Teams using [Direct Routing](/MicrosoftTeams/direct-routing-landing-page).
 
After you've completed the steps to deploy and configure Skype for Business Cloud Connector Edition, verify that you can make and receive calls.
  
## Validate the deployment

1. Log in to your Skype for Business client with a user account you just set up.
    
2. Call a PSTN number from the client and confirm that the call succeeds.
    
3. Use your phone or other device associated with the PSTN number to call your Skype for Business client and confirm that the call succeeds.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > You should confirm that you can successfully make calls after adding additional sites or converting sites to enable HA support.
