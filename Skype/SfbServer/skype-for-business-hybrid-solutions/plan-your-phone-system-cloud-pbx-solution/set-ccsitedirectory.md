## Detailed Description
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

To provide gateway affinity and high availability, Cloud Connector appliances can be combined in sites. Users are assigned to sites instead of Cloud Connector appliances. Each site has a shared folder where the base VHD and Cloud Connector installation files are stored. Appliances use this folder during the deployment. This folder should be shared with all other appliances in a Cloud Connector site.
  
The default folder is C:\Users\%userprofile%\CloudConnector\SiteRoot. The path can be viewed by using the Get-CcSiteDirectory cmdlet.
