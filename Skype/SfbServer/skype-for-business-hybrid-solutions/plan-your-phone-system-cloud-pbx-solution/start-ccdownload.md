## Detailed Description
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

If there's a new version available in the download site, Start-CcDownload will download and install the msi file from the download site, and then download the Cloud Connector bits synchronously. If there is no new version of the msi file, Start-CcDownload will download the Cloud Connector bits only. If the Cloud Connector bits are already downloaded, Start-CcDownload does not execute.
