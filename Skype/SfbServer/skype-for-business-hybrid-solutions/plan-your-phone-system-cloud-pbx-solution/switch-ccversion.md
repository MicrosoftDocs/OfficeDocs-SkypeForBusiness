## Detailed Description
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

The Switch-CcVersion cmdlet drains the Cloud Connector services on the Mediation Server and Edge Server. All running calls will be completed, but the appliance will reject any new calls. After draining, the cmdlet disconnects the running appliance from the corporate and Internet networks, turns off all the virtual machines belonging to the appliance, and then connects the backup appliance to the corporate and Internet networks.
