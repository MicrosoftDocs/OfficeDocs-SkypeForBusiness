# Deploy conferencing in Skype for Business Server 2015
[]
 **Summary:** Read this topic to learn how to deploy conferencing in Skype for Business Server 2015.
  
There are four types of conferencing available in Skype for Business Server: web conferencing, audio and video (A/V) conferencing, dial-in conferencing, and instant message (IM) conferencing. You can choose to enable all conferencing types, or to use only one type, depending on your needs. 
  
When you deploy Skype for Business Server, IM conferencing capabilities are automatically deployed. When you create and publish a new topology by using Topology Builder, you specify whether to deploy web, A/V, and dial-in conferencing, as described in the following checklists: 
  
- [Deployment checklist for web and audio/video conferencing](deploy-conferencing.md#BKMK_ChecklistWebConferencing)
    
- [Deployment flowchart and checklist for dial-in conferencing](deploy-conferencing.md#BKMK_DialinConferencing)
    
Before you deploy conferencing, you should read the following planning topics:
  
- [Plan for conferencing in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../plan-your-deployment/conferencing/conferencing.md)
    
- [Hardware and software requirements for conferencing in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../plan-your-deployment/conferencing/hardware-and-software-requirements.md)
    
- [Plan your conferencing topology for Skype for Business Server 2015](../../plan-your-deployment/conferencing/conferencing-topology.md)
    
- [Plan for dial-in conferencing in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../plan-your-deployment/conferencing/dial-in-conferencing-0.md)

## Deployment flowchart and checklist for dial-in conferencing
<a name="BKMK_DialinConferencing"> </a>

 Dial-in conferencing allows users to dial in from the public switched telephone network (PSTN) to join an audio/video conference.
  
Some of the components required for dial-in conferencing are also used for Enterprise Voice. For example, if you are deploying Enterprise Voice, you must also deploy a Mediation Server and a PSTN gateway--components that are also required for dial-in conferencing. How you deploy dial-in conferencing, therefore, depends on whether you are also deploying an Enterprise Voice solution. 
  
The dial-in conferencing flowchart shows the steps you must follow depending on whether you are also deploying an Enterprise Voice solution. The table following the flowchart provides an overview of steps required and recommended for deploying dial-in conferencing. Links to the associated planning and procedural documentation are also included. For more information about planning a complete Enterprise Voice solution, see [Plan your Enterprise Voice solution in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../plan-your-deployment/enterprise-voice-solution/enterprise-voice-solution.md).

|**Install required hardware and software** <br/> | Conferencing runs on Front End Servers of a Front End pool and Standard Edition servers. See the server and environmental requirements for Front End Servers. <br/>  You need to ensure that the following are installed before configuring dial-in conferencing: <br/>  Mediation Server <br/>  PSTN gateway <br/>  Unified Communications Application Service (UCAS) (called the Application service) <br/>  Conferencing Attendant application <br/>  Conferencing Announcement application <br/> |Domain user who is a member of the local Administrators group  <br/> |[Server requirements for Skype for Business Server 2015](../../plan-your-deployment/requirements-for-your-environment/server-requirements.md) <br/> [Environmental requirements for Skype for Business Server 2015](../../plan-your-deployment/requirements-for-your-environment/environmental-requirements.md) <br/> [Hardware and software requirements for conferencing in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../plan-your-deployment/conferencing/hardware-and-software-requirements.md) <br/> [Plan for dial-in conferencing in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../plan-your-deployment/conferencing/dial-in-conferencing-0.md) <br/> [Mediation Server component in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../plan-your-deployment/enterprise-voice-solution/mediation-server.md) <br/> [Deploy a Mediation Server in Topology Builder in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../deploy-1/deploy-enterprise-voice/deploy-a-mediation-server.md) <br/> [Define a gateway in Topology Builder in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../deploy-1/deploy-enterprise-voice/define-a-gateway.md) <br/> |
|**Create a topology that includes the Conferencing workload, including a Mediation Server and PSTN gateway, and deploy the Front End pool or Standard Edition server** <br/> |1. Run Topology Builder to configure your topology. While configuring the topology, select the dial-in conferencing option.  <br/> 2. Publish the topology and deploy the Front End pool or Standard Edition server.  <br/> 3. If necessary, create a stand-alone Mediation Server and associate it with a PSTN gateway.  <br/> **Note:** This step is required only if you do not deploy Enterprise Voice and do not collocate the Mediation Server with the Enterprise Edition Front End Server or Standard Edition server. If you deploy Enterprise Voice, you install and configure Mediation Servers and PSTN gateways as part of the Enterprise Voice deployment. If you collocate the Mediation Server, you install and configure the Mediation Server as part of the Front End pool or Standard Edition server deployment. <br/> |Domain Admins  <br/> RTCUniversalServerAdmins  <br/> Administrator  <br/> |[Create and publish new topology in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../deploy-1/install-0/create-and-publish-new-topology.md) <br/> [Deploy a Mediation Server in Topology Builder in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../deploy-1/deploy-enterprise-voice/deploy-a-mediation-server.md) <br/> [Define a gateway in Topology Builder in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../deploy-1/deploy-enterprise-voice/define-a-gateway.md) <br/> |
|**Configure dial plans** <br/> |A dial plan is a set of phone number normalization rules that translate phone numbers dialed from a specific location to a single standard (E.164) format for purposes of phone authorization and call routing. The same phone number dialed from different locations can, based on the respective dial plans, resolve to different E.164 numbers, as appropriate to each location. If you deploy Enterprise Voice, you set up dial plans as part of that deployment, and you need to make sure that the dial plans also accommodate dial-in conferencing. If you do not deploy Enterprise Voice, you need to set up dial plans for dial-in conferencing.  <br/> Use Skype for Business Server Control Panel or Skype for Business Server Management Shell to set up dial plans as follows:  <br/> 1. Create one or more dial plans for routing dial-in access phone numbers.  <br/> 2. Assign a default dial plan to each pool. Set the **Dial-in conferencing region** to the geographic location to which the dial plan applies. The region associates the dial plan with dial-in access numbers. <br/> |RTCUniversalServerAdmins  <br/> CsVoiceAdministrator  <br/> CsServerAdministrator  <br/> CsAdministrator  <br/> |[Configure dial-in conferencing in Skype for Business Server 2015](dial-in-conferencing-2.md) <br/> [Create or modify a dial plan in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../deploy-1/deploy-enterprise-voice/dial-plans.md) <br/> [New-CsDialPlan](../../manage/management-shell/new-csdialplan.md) <br/> |

With dial-out phoning, the conference server calls the user, and the user answers the phone to join the conference. <br/> |RTCUniversalServerAdmins  <br/> CsServerAdministrator  <br/> CsAdministrator  <br/> |[Manage conferencing policies in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../manage/conferencing-0/conferencing-policies.md) <br/> [New-CsConferencingPolicy](../../manage/management-shell/new-csconferencingpolicy.md) <br/> [Set-CsConferencingPolicy](../../manage/management-shell/set-csconferencingpolicy.md) <br/> |

All access numbers are available on the Dial-in Conferencing Settings page.  <br/> **Note:** After you create dial-in access numbers, you can use the **Set-CsDialInConferencingAccessNumber** cmdlet to modify the display name of the Active Directory contact objects so that users can more easily identify the correct access number. <br/> |RTCUniversalServerAdmins  <br/> CsServerAdministrator  <br/> CsAdministrator  <br/> |[Create or modify a dial plan in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../deploy-1/deploy-enterprise-voice/dial-plans.md) <br/> [Manage dial-in conferencing access numbers in Skype for Business Server 2015](../../manage/conferencing-0/access-numbers.md) <br/> [New-CsDialInConferencingAccessNumber](../../manage/management-shell/new-csdialinconferencingaccessnumber.md) <br/> [Set-CsDialInConferencingAccessNumber](../../manage/management-shell/set-csdialinconferencingaccessnumber.md) <br/> |
