# Schema attributes and descriptions in Skype for Business Server
 
This section describes all the schema attributes used by Skype for Business Server. For the classes associated with attributes, see [Schema attributes by class in Skype for Business Server](schema-attributes-by-class.md).
  
Attributes that are linked pairs are specified as forward links or back links. An attribute that refers to another object is a forward link; the attribute of the other object that refers back to the first object is a back link. Forward links are updatable, while back links are read-only.
  
Some attributes have a bit-mask value. For these attributes, each setting is represented by a bit, and the displayed decimal value represents the bit position. Bit positions start with bit 0. For example, 1 (binary) is bit 0 set and 10000 (binary) is bit 4 set. Each bit represents a property. The following are some examples: 
  
- 10000 (binary) has a decimal value of 16 (that is, bit 4 is set).
    
- 100000000 (binary) has a decimal value of 256 (that is, bit 8 is set).
    
- 1100 (binary) has a decimal value of 12 (that is, bits 2 and 3 are set; properties represented by both bits are enabled).
    
- 1111000001 (binary) has a decimal value of 961 (that is, bits 0, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are set; properties for each of these bits are enabled).

| msRTCSIP-EnableBestEffortNotify (obsolete)  <br/>            | This attribute controls whether a server generates a Best Effort NOTIFY (BENOTIFY) request, instead of a NOTIFY request, in response to a SUBSCRIBE request from a client. BENOTIFY is a performance-enhancing extension to the subscribe notification handshake where the server generates BENOTIFY requests, instead of regular NOTIFY requests. The performance benefit is that a BENOTIFY request does not require a 200 OK response from the client as the NOTIFY request does.  <br/> The valid values are **TRUE** or **FALSE**.  <br/> > [!NOTE]> Live Communications Server 2003 does not support BENOTIFY requests. To interoperate with server applications written with the Live Communications Server 2003 server API running on Live Communications Server 2005 and third-party servers, BENOTIFY requests can be disabled by setting its value to **FALSE**.

| msRTCSIP-PoolDomainFQDN  <br/>                               | This attribute is a single-valued string value. The value of this attribute, when present, represents the pool's domain FQDN if the administrator wants to create a Front End pool with an FQDN that does not conform to the Active Directory domain structure in which the Front End pool is created (for example, a SIP namespace disjoined from Domain Name System (DNS) namespace).  <br/> We recommend that you map the Front End pool domain FQDN to the domain name portion as the Active Directory domain in which the pool resides. Therefore, when no value is present in this attribute, the Front End pool FQDN will default to the Active Directory domain name structure, as denoted by the **dnsHostName** attribute. <br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | New in Office Communications Server 2007.  <br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

The first phone route with a usage attribute that matches the caller's allowed usage is selected.  <br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | New in Office Communications Server 2007.  <br/> Obsolete in Lync Server 2010.  <br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
