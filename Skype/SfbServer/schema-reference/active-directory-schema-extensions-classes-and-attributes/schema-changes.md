# Schema changes in Skype for Business Server
 
Before you deploy and operate Skype for Business Server, you must prepare Active Directory Domain Services by extending the schema. The schema extensions add the classes and attributes that are required by Skype for Business Server. 
  
Skype for Business Server requires several new classes and attributes and modifies some existing classes and attributes. In addition, much configuration information for Skype for Business Server is stored in the Central Management store instead of in AD DS as in previous versions. The following information is still stored in AD DS in Skype for Business Server:
  
- **Schema extensions**:
    
  - User object extensions
    
  - Extensions for classes to maintain backward compatibility with supported previous versions of Lync Server.
    
- **Data** (stored in Skype for Business Server extended schema and in existing schema classes):
    
  - User SIP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and other user settings
    
  - Contact objects for applications such as Response Group and Conferencing Attendant
    
  - A pointer to the Central Management store
    
  - Kerberos Authentication Account (an optional computer object)
    
This topic describes the Active Directory schema changes required by Skype for Business Server. It does not describe schema changes that were introduced by previous versions of Office Communications Server. For a list of classes and their descriptions, see [Schema classes and descriptions in Skype for Business Server](schema-classes-and-descriptions.md). For a list of attributes and their descriptions, see [Schema attributes and descriptions in Skype for Business Server](schema-attributes-and-descriptions.md). For a list of classes with the attributes they may contain, see [Schema attributes by class in Skype for Business Server](schema-attributes-by-class.md).
