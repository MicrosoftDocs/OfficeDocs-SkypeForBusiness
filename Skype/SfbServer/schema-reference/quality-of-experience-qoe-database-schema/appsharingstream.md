# AppSharingStream table
 
The AppSharingStream table contains Quality of Experience metrics for the network streams used for application sharing. This table was introduced in Microsoft Lync Server 2013.
  
|**Column**|**Data Type**|**Key/Index**|**Details**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**ConferenceDateTime** <br/> |dateTime  <br/> |Primary, Foreign  <br/> |Date and time that the session started.  <br/> |
|**SessionSeq** <br/> |int  <br/> |Primary, Foreign  <br/> |Sequential identifier used to distinguish between sessions that started on the same date and at the same time.  <br/> |
|**MediaLineLabel** <br/> |tinyint  <br/> |Primary, Foreign  <br/> | See [MediaLine Table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/schema-reference/quality-of-experience-qoe-database-schema/medialine-0). <br/> |
|**StreamID** <br/> |int  <br/> |Primary  <br/> |Unique identifier of the application sharing stream.  <br/> |
|**JitterInterArrival** <br/> |int  <br/> ||Average jitter detected between RTP packet arrivals. (Jitter is a measure of the "shakiness" of a call.) High jitter values are typically caused by congestion or an overloaded media server, and result in distorted or lost audio.  <br/> |
|**JitterInterArrivalMax** <br/> |int  <br/> ||Maximum jitter detected between RTP packet arrivals. (Jitter is a measure of the "shakiness" of a call.) High jitter values are typically caused by congestion or an overloaded media server, and result in distorted or lost audio.  <br/> |
|**RoundTrip** <br/> |int  <br/> ||Average amount of (in milliseconds) required for a Real-Time Transport Protocol packet to travel to another endpoint and then back. Round-trip times of 200 milliseconds or less are considered of acceptable quality.  <br/> High round-trip values can be caused by international call routing; a routing misconfiguration; or an overloaded media server. High round-trip times result in difficulties with two-way, real-time audio conversations.  <br/> |
|**RoundTripMax** <br/> |int  <br/> ||Maximum amount of (in milliseconds) required for a Real-Time Transport Protocol packet to travel to another endpoint and then back. Round-trip times of 200 milliseconds or less are considered of acceptable quality.  <br/> High round-trip values can be caused by international call routing; a routing misconfiguration; or an overloaded media server. High round-trip times result in difficulties with two-way, real-time audio conversations.  <br/> |
|**PacketLossRate** <br/> |float  <br/> ||Average rate of Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) packet loss. (Packet loss occurs when RTP packets, a protocol used for transmitting audio and video across the Internet, failed to reach their destination.) High loss rates are generally caused by congestion; lack of bandwidth; wireless congestion or interference; or an overloaded media server. Packet loss typically results in distorted or lost audio.  <br/> |
|**PacketLossRateMax** <br/> |float  <br/> ||Maximum rate of Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) packet loss. (Packet loss occurs when RTP packets, a protocol used for transmitting audio and video across the Internet, failed to reach their destination.)
