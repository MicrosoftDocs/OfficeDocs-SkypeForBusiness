# MediaLine table
 
Each record represents one media line. (One audio session usually contains one audio media line. One audio and video (A/V) session usually contains one audio media line and one video media line, although the session might contain two video media lines if a conferencing device is used or if Gallery View is used.

|**CallerReflexiveLocalIPAddr** <br/> |int  <br/> |Foreign  <br/> |Reflexive IP address of the user who placed the call. In organizations that use NAT (network address translation), the reflexive IP address is the IP address of the proxy server.  <br/> This column was introduced in Microsoft Lync Server 2013.  <br/> |
|**CallerWiFiDriverDevicesDesc** <br/> |int  <br/> |Foreign  <br/> |Device description for the WiFi driver employed by the user who placed the call.  <br/> This column was introduced in Microsoft Lync Server 2013.  <br/> |
