description: "The MediaLine View stores information about each media line in the database. One audio session typically contains one audio media line. One audio and video (A/V) session typically contains one audio media line and one video media line; however, the session might contain two video media lines if a conferencing device is used or if Gallery View is used. This view was introduced in Microsoft Lync Server 2013."

# MediaLine view
 
The MediaLine View stores information about each media line in the database. One audio session typically contains one audio media line. One audio and video (A/V) session typically contains one audio media line and one video media line; however, the session might contain two video media lines if a conferencing device is used or if Gallery View is used. This view was introduced in Microsoft Lync Server 2013.
