# Antivirus scanning exclusions for Skype for Business Server

Overview of antivirus scanner interoperation with Skype for Business Server.

This article contains recommendations that may help an administrator determine the cause of potential instability on a computer that is running a supported version of Microsoft Windows when it is used with antivirus software in an Active Directory domain environment or in a managed business environment.

We recommend that you temporarily apply these procedures to evaluate a system. If your system performance or stability is improved by the recommendations that are made in this article, contact your antivirus software vendor for instructions or for an updated version of the antivirus software.

This article contains information that shows how to help lower security settings or how to temporarily turn off security features on a computer. You can make these changes to understand the nature of a specific problem. Before you make these changes, we recommend that you evaluate the risks that are associated with implementing this workaround in your particular environment. If you implement this workaround, take any appropriate additional steps to help protect the computer for the files that are no longer being scanned by your antivirus software.

To ensure that the antivirus scanner does not interfere with the operation of Skype for Business Server, you must exclude specific processes and directories for each Skype for Business Server server or server role on which you run an antivirus scanner. The following processes and directories should be excluded:

> [!NOTE]
> Folder and file locations listed below are the default locations for Skype for Business Server. For any locations for which you did not use the default, exclude the locations you specified for your organization instead of the default locations specified in this topic.
