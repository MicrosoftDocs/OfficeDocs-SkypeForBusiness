# Plan for unified contact store in Skype for Business Server 2015
 
**Summary:** Review this topic while planning to integrate Skype for Business Server with Exchange 2013 or 2016.
  
Unified contact store provides a consistent contact experience across Microsoft Office products, and enables users to store all contact information in Exchange 2013 but allows the information to be available globally across Skype for Business, Exchange, Outlook, and Outlook Web Access.
  
## Requirements for unified contact store

To implement unified contact store in Skype for Business Server:
  
- You must be running Skype for Business Server and Exchange 2013 or 2016.
    
- Users must use Skype for Business to migrate their contacts from Skype for Business Server to Exchange 2013 or 2016.
    
- User mailboxes must be migrated to Exchange 2013.
    
- You must have server-to-server authentication configured between Skype for Business Server and Exchange 2013 or 2016.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > For detailed requirements about setting up authentication between Skype for Business Server and Exchange 2013 or 2016, see [Manage server-to-server authentication (OAuth) and partner applications in Skype for Business Server](../../manage/authentication/server-to-server-and-partner-applications.md) in the Operations documentation.
