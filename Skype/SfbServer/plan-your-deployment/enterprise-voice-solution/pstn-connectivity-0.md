# Plan for PSTN connectivity in Skype for Business Server
 
Plan for PSTN connectivity in Enterprise Voice in Skype for Business Server.
  
An enterprise-grade VoIP solution must provide for calls to and from the public switched telephone network (PSTN) without any decline in Quality of Service (QoS). Users who place and receive calls should not be aware of the underlying technology: from the user's perspective, a call between the Enterprise Voice infrastructure and the PSTN should seem like just another phone call.
  
Skype for Business Server provides reliable, scalable PSTN connectivity by using the following options:
  
- **SIP trunks** to an Internet telephony service provider (ITSP)
    
- **Direct SIP connections** to a PSTN gateway
    
- **Direct SIP connections** to a PBX
    
Depending on its size, geographic coverage, and existing voice infrastructure, an enterprise may use one, two, or even all three of these options at various locations. For details about these options, see the following sections.
