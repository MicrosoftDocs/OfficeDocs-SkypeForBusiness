# Choose an E9-1-1 service provider for Skype for Business Server
 
Choosing your service provider for an E9-1-1 deployment in Skype for Business Server Enterprise Voice.
  
The E9-1-1 service provider routes emergency calls originating from Skype for Business Server to the correct Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) based on the location information contained within the call. 
  
To support E9-1-1 as part of a Skype for Business Server deployment, you must obtain E9-1-1 routing service from a Lync Open Interoperability Program qualified E9-1-1 service provider. Choose the provider that best fits your organizational requirements.

To see the list of E9-1-1 routing services for Lync, see [E-911 Services qualified for Lync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/lync-cert/e-911-service-providers).
