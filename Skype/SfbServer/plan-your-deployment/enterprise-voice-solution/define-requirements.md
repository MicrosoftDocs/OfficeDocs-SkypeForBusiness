# Define your requirements for emergency calls in Skype for Business Server
 
Summarizes the steps necessary for enabling E9-1-1 in Skype for Business Server Enterprise Voice, depending on whether you have a SIP trunk E9-1-1 service provider or an ELIN gateway.
  
Before you begin a Skype for Business Server E9-1-1 deployment, you should first be able to answer the questions detailed in the following sections. The planning you need to do depends on the type of E9-1-1 solution that you choose to deploy—a SIP trunk E9-1-1 service provider or an Emergency Location Identification Number (ELIN) gateway. The following table identifies the sections in this planning workbook that you'll need to review for each of those solutions.
