# Plan for call management features in Skype for Business

Overview of supported call-management features in Skype for Business Server Enterprise Voice.

Enterprise Voice call management features control how incoming calls are routed and answered. Skype for Business Server provides the following call management features:

- **Call Park**: Enables voice users to temporarily park a call and then pick it up from the same or another phone.

- **Group Pickup**: Enables voice users to pick up calls that are ringing for other voice users who are assigned to call pickup groups.

- **Response Group**: Routes incoming calls to groups of agents by using hunt groups or interactive voice response (IVR) questions and answers.

- **Announcement**: Plays a message for calls made to an unassigned number, or routes the call elsewhere, or both.

If you plan to deploy Enterprise Voice, you can choose to implement any or all of these call management features.
