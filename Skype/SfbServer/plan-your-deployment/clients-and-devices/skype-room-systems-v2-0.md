## Room inventory and capability planning

The first step is to inventory your organization’s existing meeting and conference rooms to understand their environment, room size, layout, and purpose, and to identify the capabilities you want each room in scope to have in the future such as which richer collaboration capabilities will be enabled in the room. 

After you create an inventory of the equipment and capabilities in each existing room, your requirements for that room feed into your device selection planning to create a rich conferencing solution. The modalities (audio, video) needed for each room—in addition to room size and purpose—all play an important role in deciding which solution is most appropriate for each room. 

As part of your discovery, it’s key to consider room acoustics and layout. For example, check that the chairs in the room won’t block the camera view. Verify that the room doesn’t have excessive echo or noisy air conditioning, and that it does have sufficient power for the screens and Skype Room Systems v2. There are many factors to consider that your audio-visual (AV) team or partner will be able to advise on.

**Pro Tip** – If you have many sites to inventory, you might want to download
and use the [Site Rollout and Migration Planning - Site
Questionnaire](https://myadvisor.fasttrack.microsoft.com/CloudVoice/Downloads?SelectedIDs=5_1_0_15).

## Device selection 

Evaluate which Skype Room Systems v2 solution is the most suitable for each room based on the future capabilities you want for the room. Decide which AV peripheral devices are the best fit, depending on room size and layout. 

For guidance for the type of system and peripheral devices by room type and size, see the [Skype Room Systems v2 requirements](requirements.md) article. 

Based on the vendor you prefer, use the information provided in the requirements article to define your Skype Room Systems v2 and supported peripheral device configuration per room type, and use this as a template for your deployment. 

**Pro Tip** – Some room types might not be applicable for your deployment.

**Pro Tip –** Now is a great time to start gathering information about the Skype Room Systems v2 solution you’ve chosen. We recommend that you work with your vendor to discuss completing the design template to capture information that will be relevant to your deployment; you can [download this handy template](https://myadvisor.fasttrack.microsoft.com/CloudVoice/Downloads?SelectedIDs=4_4_0_11) from MyAdvisor. 

## Procurement 

You can procure your chosen system as a bundle or an integrated solution via device partners. You can also acquire a partner device dock and prepare your own Skype Room Systems v2 solution by using a Surface Pro device and existing, _supported_ AV peripheral devices. 

You can acquire Skype Room Systems v2 from a number of partners who are listed in the [requirements article](requirements.md). Please visit the partners’ websites to learn more about these solutions and procurement options. 

Depending on your deployment scale and approach, you might decide to have the Skype Room Systems v2 and supported peripheral devices shipped to a central location for initial configuration and assignment. This might be a good approach for a staged rollout across many sites. Or, you might choose to ship the bundles directly to your sites. 

|    |     |
|-----------|------------|
| ![](../../media/audio_conferencing_image7.png) <br/>Decision points|<ul><li>Will you ship the components directly to a site or to a staging facility?</li><li>Who will manage the staging facility (if you decide to use one)?</li></ul>|
| ![](../../media/audio_conferencing_image9.png)<br/>Next steps|<ul><li>Plan for operations.</li><li>Plan for adoption and change management.</li></ul>|

## Plan for operations 

Your organization must execute monitoring, administration, and management tasks on an ongoing basis, and it’s key to agree who will undertake these tasks early in your deployment. 

Many organizations have an AV team or partner who manages their conference rooms and devices. This team should be involved in agreeing who will manage the Skype Room Systems v2 devices going forward to monitor performance, and deploy software updates and hotfixes. 

Consider which helpdesk queue you’ll route Skype Room Systems v2֪–related calls to, and provide an FAQ to the helpdesk team so they can better understand how to use Skype Room Systems v2 and the key troubleshooting steps they can take. A good starting point for this FAQ is the [user help](https://support.office.com/article/Skype-Room-Systems-version-2-help-e667f40e-5aab-40c1-bd68-611fe0002ba2) and the [known issues list](../../manage/skype-room-systems-v2/known-issues.md).

## Plan for adoption and change management

Skype Room Systems v2 systems introduce new capabilities to your users. It’s important that you recognize that this will be a change for your users, and you should ensure your campaign identifies the benefits the new system will have for your users and the key talking points leads can use to discuss with their teams. 

Consider scheduling show-and-tell events and poster drops at each site to inform your users of the new capabilities. You might also create in-room “quick start guides.” Consider finding a meetings champion on each site who can help others get up to speed and start using the devices.
