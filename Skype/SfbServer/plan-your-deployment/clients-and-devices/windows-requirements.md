## Hardware

Refer to the Office 365 [System requirements](https://products.office.com/en-us/office-system-requirements) for the hardware required to run the Skype for Business client.
  
## Skype Meetings App and Skype for Business Web App 

The Skype Meetings App and Skype for Business Web App support specific combinations of operating systems and browsers. For details, see [Plan for Meetings clients (Web App and Meetings App)](meetings-clients.md). 
  
## Using Mandatory Profiles

If you plan to use the Skype for Business conferencing features, avoid using Active Directory Domain Services mandatory profiles to sign in to the Skype for Business client. Because mandatory profiles are read-only user profiles, the public key infrastructure (PKI) keys that are required for Skype for Business conferencing cannot be saved to the profile.
