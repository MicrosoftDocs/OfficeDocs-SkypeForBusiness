- **USB extenders**:

  - USB ports on tablet docks are USB 3.0 compatible. You can use a USB 2.x extender, but doing so will limit you to USB 2.x speeds on the far end and doing so is not recommended for USB 3.0 peripherals.

  - An extender must meet USB 2.0 or newer specifications.

  - Tablet docks support at least two stages of external USB hub extension. If need to connect more than two USB hubs in series, you will need to check with the dock manufacturer to confirm doing so is supported.

- Wired GbE connection in the room. Ethernet cable of appropriate length.

- Up to two 1080p displays with HDMI connections. HDMI cables of appropriate length.

    > [!NOTE]
    > A consumer TV used as a front of room display needs to support/enable the Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) feature of HDMI so that it can switch automatically to an active video source from standby mode. This feature is not supported on all TVs. 

> [!NOTE]
> Skype Room Systems v2 does not use a keyboard. If needed, the Admin should use the on-screen keyboard. A USB keyboard or mouse will be required when imaging the Skype Room Systems v2 device. 

The following tables provide recommendations for peripherals based on room size:
