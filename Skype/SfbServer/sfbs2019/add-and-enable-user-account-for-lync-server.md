2. Open a browser window, and then enter the Admin URL to open the Lync Server Control Panel. For details about the different methods you can use to start Lync Server Control Panel, see [Open Lync Server 2013 administrative tools](open-lync-server-administrative-tools.md).
    
3. In the left navigation bar, click **Users**.
    
4. Click **Enable users**.
    
5. On the **New Lync Server User** dialog, click **Add**.
    
6. In the **Search users** box, type all or the first portion of the name, display name, first name, last name, Security Accounts Manager (SAM) account name, email address, User Principal Name (UPN), or phone number of the Active Directory user account that you want, and then click **Find**.
    
7. In the table, select the account you want to add to Lync Server, and then click **OK**.
    
8. Assign the user to a pool, specify any additional details, and assign the policies to the user you want, and then click **Enable**.
