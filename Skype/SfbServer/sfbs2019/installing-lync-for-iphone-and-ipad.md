# Installing Lync for iPhone and iPad in Lync Server 2013
[]
Lync 2013 for iPhone and Lync 2013 for iPad are user-installable applications that are available in the Apple App Store. 
  
## Installing Lync for iPhone and Lync for iPad

You can instruct your users to install Lync 2013 for iPhone and Lync 2013 for iPad by directing them to the App Store from their devices. The App Store for each device is also available online.
  
- Lync for iPhone is available in the App Store at \< http://www.apple.com/iphone/from-the-app-store/\>
    
- Lync for iPad is available in the App Store at \< http://www.apple.com/ipad/from-the-app-store/\>
    
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  iPhone users who have not installed the Lync 2013 app and who try to join a Lync meeting from a meeting invitation will be redirected to a Join Launcher page. This page contains a link for installing the Lync 2013 app. However, instead of directing the user to the App Store, this link opens a blank Safari browser page. The user can do one of two things to work around this issue: >  Use the **Home** button to send the Safari page to the background, and then reopen Safari. When the notification "Open this page in App Store" appears, tap **Open** to be directed to Lync 2013 download in the App Store. >  Manually open the App Store, search for "Lync 2013," and download the app. 
  
## Verifying Mobile Client Installation

After you configure the client and sign in successfully, use the following tests to verify that your Lync installation is working correctly on your mobile device. 
  
### Search for a contact in the corporate directory

1. In the Contacts list, tap inside the search bar at the top, and begin typing the name of a contact that exists only in the global address list (GAL). 
    
2. Verify that the contact name appears in the search results. 
    
### Test instant messaging and presence

1. In the Contacts list, tap a contact. 
    
2. In the contact card, tap the **IM** icon. 
    
3. Verify that an instant messaging (IM) window appears and that you can type and send an IM. 
    
### Test dial-out conferencing

1. In Outlook, schedule a Lync meeting. 
    
2. On the mobile device, open the meeting invitation. 
    
3. Click the link in the meeting to join. 
    
4. Answer the call from the conference service and verify that you are connected to the meeting audio. 
    
### Test push notifications

1. On user A's mobile device, sign in to Lync with user A's account. 
    
2. Open another application on the mobile device. 
    
3. On a different client, sign in to Lync with user B's account. 
    
4. Send an IM from user B to user A. 
    
5. Verify that the IM notification appears on user A's mobile device.
