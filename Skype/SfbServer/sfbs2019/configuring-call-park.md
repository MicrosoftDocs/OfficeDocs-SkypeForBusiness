# Configuring Call Park in Lync Server 2013
[]
Call Park enables an Enterprise Voice user to put a call on hold from one telephone and then retrieve the call later by dialing an internal number (known as a Call Park orbit) from any telephone.
  
The components that Call Park uses are automatically installed and enabled on the Front End Server or Standard Edition server when you deploy Enterprise Voice. However, you must configure Call Park before it is available to users. 
  
This section guides you through the configuration of Call Park.
