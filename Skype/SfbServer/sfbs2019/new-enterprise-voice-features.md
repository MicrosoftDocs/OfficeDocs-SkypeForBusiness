# New Enterprise Voice features in Lync Server 2013
[]
Lync Server 2013 introduces several new routing and call management features that enhance Enterprise Voice.
  
Lync Server 2013 supports multiple trunks between Mediation Servers and gateways. A trunk is a logical association between a port number and Mediation Server with a port number and gateway. This means that a Mediation Server can have multiple trunks to different gateways, and a gateway can have multiple trunks to different Mediation Servers. Intertrunk routing makes it possible for Lync Server 2013 to interconnect an IP-PBX to a public switched telephone network (PSTN) gateway or to interconnect multiple IP-PBX systems. Lync Server 2013 serves as the glue (that is, the interconnection) between different telephony systems. 
  
Microsoft Lync Server 2013 makes improvements in the areas of call forwarding, simultaneous ringing, voice mail handling, and caller ID presentation. These features enrich the Enterprise Voice call experience.
