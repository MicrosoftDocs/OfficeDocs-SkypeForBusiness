# Providing PSTN connectivity at a branch site in Lync Server 2013
[]
We recommend using the Microsoft Lync Server 2013, Planning Tool to add branch sites to your topology and to set up your voice infrastructure in branch sites.
  
If you are not using the Planning Tool, use the procedures in the topics in this section—first, to add the branch sites, and then, to set up your voice infrastructure by defining the IP/public switched telephone network (PSTN) gateway and/or by configuring the SIP trunk (with or without media bypass). Connecting a private branch exchange (PBX) to the branch site is another option.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you want to provide branch-site resiliency, you must deploy a Survivable Branch Appliance, a Survivable Branch Server, or Standard Edition server at the branch site. For details, see [Deploying a Survivable Branch Appliance or Server with Lync Server 2013](deploying-a-survivable-branch-appliance-or-server.md) or [Deploying Lync Server 2013](deploying-lync-server-2013.md), as appropriate, in the Deployment documentation.
