# Restoring data and settings in Lync Server 2013
[]
If you have implemented a disaster recovery topology with paired pools, and one of those Front End pools has gone down and you need to quickly restore service to your users, see [Failing over a pool in Lync Server 2013](failing-over-a-pool.md). Otherwise, use the information in the following topics, along with the worksheets in [Backup and restoration worksheets for Lync Server 2013](backup-and-restoration-worksheets.md), to restore Lync Server after a failure or outage. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> To reduce downtime and potential data loss, perform the restoration procedures described in this document only if troubleshooting procedures are not effective in identifying and correcting the problem. During troubleshooting, try to minimize the impact on other servers and components as you shut down and restart servers.
