# Call admission control on an MPLS network with Lync Server 2013
[]
In a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) network, all sites are connected by a full-mesh. That is, all sites are connected directly to the MPLS backbone of the Internet service provider, and each site is provisioned bandwidth to be used across a WAN link to the MPLS cloud. There is no network hub or central site to control IP routing. The following figure shows a simple network based on MPLS technology.

To deploy call admission control (CAC) in an MPLS network, you create a network region to represent the MPLS cloud, and create a network site to represent each MPLS satellite site. The following figure illustrates how the network region and network sites should be configured to represent the example MPLS network in the previous figure. The overall bandwidth limits and bandwidth session limits are then based on the capacity of the WAN link from each network site to the network region that represents the MPLS cloud.
