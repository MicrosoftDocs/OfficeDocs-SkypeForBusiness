# Getting phone numbers for your users

Before you can set up users in your organization to make and receive phone calls, you must get phone numbers for them.
  
You have two ways of getting numbers for your users:
  
- Get new numbers using the **Skype for Business admin center**.
    
- Port or transfer your existing numbers from your current service provider or phone carrier to Office 365.
    
You must use the **Add new user numbers** page to see, search, acquire, and reserve those numbers. You can search by **Country/Region**, **State**, and **City**, and then enter the number of phone numbers you will need for your users.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you need help setting up phone numbers for your organization, you can [Contact support for business products - Admin Help](https://support.office.com/article/32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b).

1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.

5. Under **Quantity**, enter the number of phone numbers that you want for your organization and click **Add** to create a reservation. You have 10 minutes to select your phone numbers; if you take more than 10 minutes, the phone numbers will be returned to the pool of numbers.
    
    > [!NOTE]

    > The number of phone numbers for users (subscribers) is equal to the total number of **Domestic Calling Plan** and/or **Domestic and International Calling Plan** licenses you have assigned multiplied by 1.1, plus 10 additional phone numbers. For example, if you have 50 users in total with a Domestic Calling Plan and/or Domestic and International Calling Plan, you can acquire **65** phone numbers **(50 x 1.1 + 10)**. For details, see [How many phone numbers can you get?](how-many-phone-numbers-can-you-get.md).
