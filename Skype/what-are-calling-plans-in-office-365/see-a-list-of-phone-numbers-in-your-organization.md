# See a list of phone numbers in your organization

There are different types of phone numbers that you can assign to users or other services (service numbers), such as for Audio Conferencing in Office 365.
  
## To see a list of all phone numbers that you have for your organization

1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.
    
2. Go to the **Office 365 admin center** > **Skype for Business**.
    
3. In the **Skype for Business admin center**, in the left navigation, go to **Voice** > **Phone numbers**.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For you to see the **Voice** option in the left navigation in the Skype for Business admin center, you must first buy at least one **Enterprise E5 license**, one **Phone System** add-on license, or one **Audio Conferencing** add-on license.
    
4. To view the phone numbers that are assigned, see the **Number** column.
    
5. You can use the drop-down list to filter your view by:
    
  - **All** phone numbers including service phone numbers.
    
  - A phone **number range** that you set.
    
  - Phone numbers that are **assigned to user**.
    
  - Phone numbers that **assigned to conference** for dial-in conferencing.
    
  - Phone numbers that are **unassigned**.
    
  - The **location** of the phone numbers.
    
## To see all of the phone numbers that are assigned to users

When you are setting up users, you might just want to see the list of the phone numbers that are already assigned to users and which phone numbers can be assigned to them.
  
1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.
    
2. Go to the **Office 365 admin center** > **Skype for Business**.
    
3. In the **Skype for Business admin center**, in the left navigation, go to **Voice** > **Voice users**.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For you to see the **Voice** option in the left navigation in the Skype for Business admin center, you must first buy at least one **Enterprise E5 license**, one **Phone System** add-on license, or one **Audio Conferencing** add-on license.
    
4. You can filter your view for phone numbers that are assigned to users or phone numbers that you can assign to a user. You can filter by:
    
  - **All** phone numbers including service phone numbers.
    
  - **Number assigned** to user.
    
  - **No number assigned** to user.
    
## To see the phone numbers that are assigned to voice users

When you are setting up users in your organization to make and receive phone calls, you must first get the phone numbers and then assign them to your users. After you've gotten your phone numbers, you might just want to see the list of the users that have phone numbers assigned to users, those that don't and whether a user is hosted Online or on-premises.
  
1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.
    
2. Go to the **Office 365 admin center** > **Skype for Business**.
    
3. In the **Skype for Business admin center**, in the left navigation, go to **Voice** > **Voice users**.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For you to see the **Voice** option in the left navigation in the Skype for Business admin center, you must first buy at least one **Enterprise E5 license**, one **Phone System** add-on license, or one **Audio Conferencing** add-on license.
    
4. You can use the drop-down list to filter your view for active users, whether the user is Online or on-premises, or the state and type of licensing for a user. You can filter by:
    
  - **Active users** and whether a user is Online or on-premises.
    
  - **Pending licenses** and whether a user is Online or on-premises.
