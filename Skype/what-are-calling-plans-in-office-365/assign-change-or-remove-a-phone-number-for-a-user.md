# Assign, change, or remove a phone number for a user

When you set up Calling Plans in Office 365, you assign phone numbers to your users. The phone number you assign will be listed in the **Work Phone** box in their Skype for Business client and can't be changed by a user.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a user wants to [Change my phone number for Skype for Business](https://support.office.com/article/20e03cc1-c023-4e5d-bafd-064ddb59ed5e) ** and the phone number in the Skype for Business app can't be changed or is grayed out**, that means an admin has set it for them and it can't be changed by them.
  
## Assigning a number

When you are setting up users so they can make and receive phone calls, you must first use the Skype for Business admin center and assign a phone number, but you can change or remove the phone number if you need to.
  
To learn how to get Calling Plans in Office 365 and how much they cost, see [Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md).
  
> [!NOTE]
> One way to see whether a user has a license assigned is by going to **Skype for Business admin center** > **Voice** > **Voice users** and selecting the user. If a license is assigned, it will be noted under **Assigned license**. You also can use the Office 365 admin center. 
  
 **Assign a phone number to a user**
  
1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.
    
2. Go to **Office 365 admin center** > **Admin centers** > **Skype for Business**.
    
3. In the left navigation, click **Voice** > **Voice users**.
    
    **IMPORTANT**: For you to see the **Voice** option in the left navigation in the Skype for Business admin center, you must first buy at least one **Enterprise E5 license**, one **Phone System** add-on license, or one **Audio Conferencing** add-on license.
    
4. On the **Voice users** page, locate and select the user or users that you want to assign a phone number to.
    
5. In the Action pane, click **Assign number**.
    
6. On the **Assign number** page in the **Select number to assign** list, select the phone number for the user.
    
    > [!TIP]
    > If you don't see any phone numbers listed, you need to [Getting phone numbers for your users](getting-phone-numbers-for-your-users.md) first. Or, if you use the **Skype for Business admin center** > **Voice** > **Phone numbers** page, click **Add**, and then click **New user numbers**. 
  
7. To assign or change the associated emergency address, under **Select validated emergency location**, either select the location from the list or, if you have many locations defined, enter the name of the city in the search box and click **Search**.
    
8. After you pick the phone number and emergency location, click **Save**.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Because of the latency between Office 365 and Skype for Business Online, it can possibly take up to 24 hours for users to be enabled. If after 24 hours, if the phone number isn't assigned correctly, please [Contact support for business products - Admin Help](https://support.office.com/article/32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b). We're here to help!
