# Add, change, or remove an emergency location for your organization

Depending on the number of physical locations in your organization, you can create emergency locations for buildings, floors, and offices to create a more specific emergency address. See [What are emergency locations, addresses and call routing?](what-are-emergency-locations-addresses-and-call-routing.md) for more information.
  
To learn how to get a Calling Plan and how much they cost, see [Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md).
