# Microsoft telephony solutions

Microsoft supports several options as you begin your journey to Teams in the Microsoft cloud. This article helps you decide which Microsoft telephony solution (Phone System in the cloud or Enterprise Voice on-premises) is right for users in your organization, and how your organization can connect to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). 

You should use this article along with the associated technical diagram, which provides a visual aid for making the right decision for your organization:

## Private Branch Exchange (PBX) options

### Phone System (Microsoft 365 or Office 365)
  
Phone System is Microsoft's technology for enabling call control and Private Branch Exchange (PBX) capabilities in the Microsoft 365 or Office 365 cloud with Microsoft Teams and/or Skype for Business Online. 

Phone System works with Teams or Skype for Business Online clients and certified devices. Phone System allows you to replace your existing PBX system with a set of features directly delivered from Microsoft 365 or Office 365 and tightly integrated into the company’s cloud productivity experience. To connect Phone System to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), you can choose Microsoft’s Calling Plan or your own telephony carrier.

For more information, see [What is Phone System in Microsoft 365 or Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/what-is-phone-system-in-office-365).

### Enterprise Voice (Skype for Business Server)

Enterprise Voice is Microsoft's technology for enabling call control and Private Branch Exchange (PBX) capabilities in the on-premises Skype for Business Server. This option can only be connected to the Public Switched Telephone Network by using your own telephony carrier. 

For more information, see [Plan for Enterprise Voice in Skype for Business Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/SkypeForBusiness/plan-your-deployment/enterprise-voice-solution/enterprise-voice?toc=/SkypeForBusiness/toc.json&bc=/SkypeForBusiness/breadcrumb/toc.json).

## Connection to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) options

You can choose to connect to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) by:

- Using Microsoft Calling Plan in Microsoft 365 or Office 365 
- Connecting your own telephony carrier

### Calling Plan (Microsoft 365 or Office 365)

This option connects the Microsoft 365 or Office 365 Phone System to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) to enable calls to landlines and mobile phones around the world. With Calling Plan, Microsoft is your PSTN carrier.

For more information, see [Calling Plans for Microsoft 365 or Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/calling-plans-for-office-365).

### Connect your own telephony carrier (Microsoft 365 or Office 365 and Skype for Business on-premises)

This option connects either Phone System in Microsoft 365 or Office 365 or Enterprise Voice system in Skype for Business on-premises to your telephony network. This option requires a supported Session Border Controller (SBC). In some cases, this option might require additional Microsoft software deployed on-premises.

## Which solution is right for your organization?

You can choose an all-in-the-cloud solution, a connect-your-own-carrier solution, or a mix between all-in-the-cloud and third-party carriers:

- Phone System with Calling Plan (all in the cloud)

- Phone System with own carrier via Direct Routing

- Phone System with own carrier via Skype for Business Server OR Cloud Connector Edition

- Enterprise Voice in Skype for Business Server with own carrier

The solution you choose depends on your current and future needs, such as:

- Whether you want—-or are required—-to retain functionality provided by your on-premises deployment.
- Which client you want to deploy for your users.
- What your plan is for moving people to the cloud.
- Whether you need to interoperate with 3rd party PBXs and other telephony equipment.

Consider the following questions to determine the best solution for your organization:

- Do you have an existing Skype for Business Server deployment?
- Are your users homed in Skype for Business on premises, in the cloud on Skype for Business Online, or both? 
- Do you want to move on-premises users to the cloud?
- Is Microsoft’s PSTN Calling Plan available in your region?
- Do you want or need to keep your current telephony carrier?  For example, do you need to keep your current carrier because of an existing contract?
- Do you have an existing on-premises legacy PBX that you want or need to keep?
- Does your current legacy PBX offer unique features that are critical to your business?
- Do any or all of your users require features not currently offered in Phone System?

Note the following:

- All four options can co-exist with each other in case you need to design a solution for complex environment or managing multi-step migration.
- Phone System with own carrier via Skype for Business Server OR Cloud Connector Edition can only be deployed with either Skype for Business Server OR Cloud Connector. Co-existence of Skype for Business Server and Cloud Connector is not supported in a single company.

## Phone System with Calling Plan


Phone System with Calling Plan is an all-in-the-cloud option for Teams or Skype for Business Online users as shown in the following diagram:

![Phone System with Calling Plan](../../sfbserver2019/media/msft-telephony-solutions-1.png)


- Microsoft Phone System with added Domestic or International Calling Plans that enables calling to  phones around the world (depending on the level of service being licensed). 
- Because PSTN Calling Plan operates out of Microsoft 365 or Office 365, this option does not require deployment or maintenance of any on-premises deployment.
- Customers can connect a supported SBC via Direct Routing for interoperability with 3rd party PBX, analog devices, and other 3rd party telephony equipment supported by the SBC.

| Infrastructure requirements                   | Required?|
| :----------------------------------------------------| ---------:|
| Requires uninterrupted connection to Microsoft 365 or Office 365 | Yes |
