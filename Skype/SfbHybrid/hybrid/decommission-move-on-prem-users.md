# Move required users before decommissioning your on-premises environment

[!INCLUDE [sfbo-retirement](../../Hub/includes/sfbo-retirement.md)]

This article describes how to move required users to the Microsoft cloud before decommissioning your on-premises Skype for Business environment. This is step 1 of the following steps to decommission your on-premises environment:

- **Step 1. Move all required users from on-premises to online.** (This article)

- Step 2. [Disable your hybrid configuration](cloud-consolidation-disabling-hybrid.md).

- Step 3. [Migrate hybrid application endpoints from on-premises to online](decommission-move-on-prem-endpoints.md). Be aware that any existing hybrid application endpoints will not be discoverable between the time you perform Step 2 above until you complete this step. You should plan to do both steps 2 and 3 in the same maintenance window.

- Step 4. [Remove your on-premises Skype for Business deployment](decommission-remove-on-prem.md).

## Move all required users from on-premises to the cloud

Any users that you will continue to use after completing the migration must first be moved from on-premises to the cloud. You move users by using the on-premises administration tools. For details, see
[Move users between on-premises and cloud](move-users-between-on-premises-and-cloud.md).

Although it is possible for users with on-premises Skype for Business Server accounts to use Teams, these users do not have the full functionality of Teams. These users cannot interoperate or federate with any other user still using Skype for Business (whether online or on-premises). Nor can these users receive PSTN calls in their Teams client. Therefore, you must move these users to online. This step also ensures any contacts or meetings created in Skype for Business Server are migrated to Teams.

To check if there are any remaining users in your on-premises deployment, run the following cmdlet in a Skype for Business Server PowerShell window.

```PowerShell
Get-CsUser -Filter { HostingProvider -eq "SRV:"}
```

If any users are returned, review the output to determine if any accounts must be moved to the cloud, and, for any such users, follow the steps [here](move-users-between-on-premises-and-cloud.md). For user accounts that are no longer needed, run the following Skype for Business Server PowerShell cmdlet:

```PowerShell
Get-CsUser -Filter { HostingProvider -eq "SRV:"} | Disable-CsUser
```

> [!NOTE]
> Running Disable-CsUser will remove all Skype for Business attributes for all users meeting the filter criteria. Before proceeding, confirm that these accounts are no longer needed going forward.

You are now ready to [disable your hybrid configuration](cloud-consolidation-disabling-hybrid.md).
