# Virtualization support for Skype for Business Server 2019

Skype for Business Server 2019 is supported on virtualization.

While virtualization is supported, there are some key points to remember:

- Maintain a 1:1 ratio of virtual CPU to physical CPU.
- Don't move a guest server while it's operating.
- Migration of a live system and portability of a virtual machine aren't supported.
- Disable hyper-threading on all hosts.
- Don't configure dynamic memory on host servers.
- Use fixed or pass-through disks rather than dynamic disks.
- Allow for 6-10 percent overhead for hypervisors beyond what the virtual guest requires.

## Supported hypervisors

SfB Server 2019 is supported on Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2019.

For third-party hypervisors, you need a hypervisor that has passed the Server Virtualization Validation Program (SVVP) testing for the relevant OS.
