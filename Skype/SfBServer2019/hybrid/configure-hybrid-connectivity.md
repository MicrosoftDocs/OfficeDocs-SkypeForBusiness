# Configure hybrid connectivity between Skype for Business Server and Office 365
 
**Summary:** Read this topic to learn how to configure hybrid connectivity between Skype for Business Server and Teams or Skype for Business Online.  Hybrid connectivity enables you to move your on-premises users to Teams or Skype for Business Online, and enables your users to take advantage of cloud services.
  
Before performing the steps in this topic, you should have read [Plan hybrid connectivity between Skype for Business Server and Office 365](plan-hybrid-connectivity.md).
  
The following table lists the tasks required to configure Skype for Business hybrid connectivity and provides links to the associated articles for more information.
  
|**Step**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Create a tenant account for Office 365   <br/> |Learn about Office 365 at [Office 365](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=254980).  <br/> To make sure that your environment is ready for Office 365, see the [System Requirements](https://products.office.com/en-US/office-system-requirements).  <br/> For details about setting up Office 365, see [Getting Started with Office 365](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=254982).  <br/> |
|Add your domain to your Office 365 tenant and verify ownership  <br/> | You must add your domain to your Office 365 tenant, and then follow the steps to validate the domain with Office 365. This is to confirm that you are the owner of the domain. <br/> To add your domain to your Office 365 tenant, follow the steps described in [Add a domain to Office 365](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-a-domain-to-office-365-6383f56d-3d09-4dcb-9b41-b5f5a5efd611?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US).  <br/> |
|Set up Active Directory synchronization  <br/> |Active Directory synchronization keeps your on-premises Active Directory continuously synchronized with Office 365. This lets you create synchronized versions of each user account and group.  <br/> <br> **Important:** You need to synchronize the AD accounts for all Skype for Business users in your organization between your on-premises and online deployments, even if users are not moved to Teams or Skype for Business Online. If you do not synchronize all users, communication between on-premises and online users in your organization may not work as expected. For more information, see [Configure Azure AD Connect for hybrid environments](configure-azure-ad-connect.md).         |
| Configure Skype for Business hybrid | There are three basic steps: <br><br> 1. Configure your on-premises environment to federate with Office 365. <br> 2. Configure your on-premises environment to trust Office 365 and enable shared SIP address space with Office 365.<br> 3. Enable shared SIP address space in your Office 365 tenant. <br><br> In addition, if you have Exchange on-premises, then you may want to configure OAuth between your Exchange on-premises and Skype for Business Online environments. <br> <br>For more information, see [Configure Skype for Business hybrid](configure-federation-with-skype-for-business-online.md).
|Move pilot users  <br/> |After you have completed the steps to prepare and configure your environment for Teams or Skype for Business Online, you can start moving pilot users to your online Office 365 tenant. For more information, see [Move users from on premises to Skype for Business Online](move-users-from-on-premises-to-skype-for-business-online.md) and [Move users from on premises to Teams](move-users-from-on-premises-to-Teams.md).  <br/> |
