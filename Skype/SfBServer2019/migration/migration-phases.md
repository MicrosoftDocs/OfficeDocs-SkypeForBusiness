# Migration phases

In Skype for Business Server 2019, you define sites on your network that contain Skype for Business Server 2019 components. A site is a set of computers that are well-connected by a high-speed, low-latency network, such as a single local area network (LAN) or two networks connected by a high-speed fiber optic network. 
  
A Front End pool is a set of Front End Servers that are configured identically and work together to provide services for a common group of users. A pool provides scalability and failover capability to your users. Each server in a pool must run an identical server role or roles. A Standard Edition server, designed for small organizations, also defines a pool and runs on a single server. This enables you to have Skype for Business Server 2019 functionality for a lesser cost, but does not provide a true high-availability solution. 
  
The following phases describe the process of a pool migration to Skype for Business Server 2019. For multiple sites containing multiple pools, each individual pool should follow this phased approach.
  
1. [Phase 1: Plan your migration](phase-1-plan-your-migration.md)
    
2. [Phase 2: Prepare for migration](phase-2-prepare-for-migration.md)
    
3. [Phase 3: Deploy Skype for Business Server 2019 pilot pool](phase-3-deploy-pilot-pool.md)
    
4. [Phase 4: Move test users to the pilot pool](phase-4-move-test-users-to-the-pilot-pool.md)
    
5. [Phase 5: Add Skype for Business Server 2019 Edge Server to pilot pool](phase-5-add-edge-server-to-pilot-pool.md)
    
6. [Phase 6: Move from pilot deployment into production](phase-6-move-from-pilot-deployment-into-production.md)
    
7. [Phase 7: Complete post-migration tasks](phase-7-complete-post-migration-tasks.md)
    
8. [Phase 8: Decommission legacy pools](phase-8-decommission-legacy-pools.md)
