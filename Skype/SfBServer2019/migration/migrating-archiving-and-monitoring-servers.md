# Migrating Archiving and Monitoring Servers

If you deployed Archiving Server and Monitoring Server in your legacy environment, you can deploy these servers in your Skype for Business Server 2019 environment after you migrate your Front End pools. If archiving and monitoring functionality are critical to your organization, however, you should add archiving and monitoring to your Skype for Business Server 2019 pilot pool before you migrate so that the functionality is available during the migration process. 
  
If you want archiving and monitoring functionality during the migration process, keep the following considerations in mind:
  
- Archiving data and monitoring data are not moved to the Skype for Business Server 2019 deployment. The data you back up prior to decommissioning the legacy environment will be your history of activity in the legacy environment.
    
- The legacy version of Archiving Server and Monitoring Server can be associated only with a legacy Front End pool. In Skype for Business Server 2019, Archiving and Monitoring are no longer server roles, but services integrated into the Skype for Business Server 2019 Front End pool.
    
- During the time that your legacy and Skype for Business Server 2019 deployments coexist, the legacy version of Archiving Server and Monitoring Server gather data for users homed on legacy pools. Archiving and Monitoring in Skype for Business Server 2019 gather data for users homed on Skype for Business Server 2019 pools.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > During the phase of migration when you are still using your legacy Edge server with the new Skype for Business Server 2019 pilot pool, the legacy version of Archiving Server continues to gather data for users homed on legacy pools and Archiving in Skype for Business Server 2019 gathers data for users homed on Skype for Business Server 2019 pools. 
  
- If you use a third-party archiving and monitoring solution in conjunction with Archiving and Monitoring in Skype for Business Server 2019, consult with your vendor about when and how you need to integrate the third-party solution with Skype for Business Server 2019.
