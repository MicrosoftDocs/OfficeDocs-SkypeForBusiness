# Migration to Skype for Business Server 2019

The topics in this section guide you through the process of migrating to Skype for Business Server 2019. This article covers migrating Lync Server 2013 or Skype for Business Server 2015 to Skype for Business Server 2019.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Throughout the content, we use the term *legacy* to refer to the legacy Lync Server 2013 or Skype for Business Server 2015 that you are migrating to Skype for Business Server 2019.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This guide describes the steps generally required to accomplish each phase of migration. It does not address every possible legacy deployment topology or every possible migration scenario. Therefore, you may not need to perform every step described, or you may need to perform additional steps, depending on your deployment. This guide also provides examples of verification steps. These verification steps are provided to help you understand what you need to look for to ensure that each phase completes successfully as you progress through your migration. Tailor these verification steps to your specific migration process. 
  
This guide provides information specific to upgrading your existing deployment. It does not explain how to change your existing topology. This guide does not cover the implementation of new features. When a detailed procedure is documented elsewhere, this guide directs you to the article or article section. 
  
This article defines terms as specified in the following list.
  
**migration:** Moving your production deployment from Lync Server 2013 or Skype for Business Server 2015 to Skype for Business Server 2019.
