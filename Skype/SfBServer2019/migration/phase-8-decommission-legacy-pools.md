# Phase 8: Decommission legacy pools

The following topic provides guidance for updating DNS entries, moving the Content Management Server, decommissioning pools, and deactivating and removing servers and pools from a legacy deployment. Not all of the procedures listed in this section are required. Read the documentation and determine which decommissioning procedure to use. 
  
For a dated but exhaustive article on removing servers and server roles, and a step-by-step guide to decommissioning a deployment, download [Uninstalling Microsoft Lync Server and Removing Server Roles](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=246227). 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> For information on migrating and upgrading Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API (UCMA) applications, before decommissioning your legacy environment, see [UCMA applications: Coexistence, migration, and upgrade scenarios](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=269555).
