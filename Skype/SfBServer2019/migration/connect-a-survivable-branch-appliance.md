# Connect a Survivable Branch Appliance

Every Survivable Branch Appliance (SBA) is associated with a Front End pool that serves as a backup registrar for the SBA. When the Front End pool is migrated to Skype for Business Server 2019, the SBA must be disassociated from the Front End pool while the pool is upgraded. After the pool has been migrated to Skype for Business Server 2019, the SBA can be re-associated with the upgraded Front End pool. This involves deleting the SBA from the legacy topology in Topology Builder and then adding the SBA to the Skype for Business Server 2019 topology. Users homed on the legacy SBA must first be moved to another Front End pool before removing the SBA from the topology. After the SBA is added to the Skype for Business Server 2019 topology, those users can be moved back to the SBA. These steps are summarized below:
  
1. Move branch users homed on the legacy SBA to another Front End pool.
    
2. Remove SBA from the legacy topology to disconnect the existing Front End pool as a backup registrar.
    
3. Add SBA to the Skype for Business Server 2019 topology and configure this new Front End pool as the backup registrar. 
    
4. Move the branch users to the new Skype for Business Server 2019 SBA.

    2. Click **State/Region**, and then type the name of the state or region in which the branch site is located.
    
    3. Click **Country Code**, and then type the two-digit calling code for the country/region in which the branch site is located.
    
7. Click **Next**, and then, if you are using a Survivable Branch Appliance or Server at this site, be sure to clear the **Open the New Survivable Wizard when this wizard closes** check box. Click **Finish**.
