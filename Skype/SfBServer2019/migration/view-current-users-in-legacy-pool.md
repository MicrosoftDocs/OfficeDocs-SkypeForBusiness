# View current users in legacy pool

Before learning the various ways you can move users between pools, we must first determine which users exist in the legacy pool. The **Registrar pool** column identifies users who are configured for the legacy pool. These are the test users we move to the Skype for Business Server 2019 pool.
  
### To see the list of users in the legacy pool

1. Sign in the legacy Front End Server with an account that is a member of the RTCUniversalServerAdmins group or a member of the CsAdministrator or CsUserAdministrator administrative role.
    
2. Open **Skype for Business Server Control Panel**.
    
3. Select **Users**, select **Search**, and then select **Find**.
