# Remove legacy Archiving and Monitoring servers

If your legacy deployment contained an Archiving Server or a Monitoring Server, after migrating to Skype for Business Server 2019, those servers can be removed from the legacy environment, provided all users have been removed from any remaining legacy pools. You can remove the Archiving Server or Monitoring Server in any sequence. The key requirement is that all users have been removed from any remaining legacy pools.
  
You can move users to Skype for Business Server 2019 by following the procedures outlined in [Phase 4: Move test users to the pilot pool](phase-4-move-test-users-to-the-pilot-pool.md).
  
After you have confirmed that all users have been removed from any remaining pools, decommision the server and remove roles. A dated, but relevant, example is "Uninstalling Microsoft Lync Server and Removing Server Roles," which can be downloaded at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=246227](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=246227).
