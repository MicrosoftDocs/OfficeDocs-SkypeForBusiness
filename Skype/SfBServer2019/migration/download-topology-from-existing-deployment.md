# Download topology from existing deployment

When creating a Skype for Business Server 2019 pool, you will use the Central Management Store that is associated with the legacy installation. When you start Topology Builder on first use and subsequent edit sessions, you are prompted for the location where you want Topology Builder to load the current configuration document. Because you already have a topology defined and have established the Central Management store, you should choose to download a topology from an existing deployment. Topology Builder will read the database and retrieve the current definition. 
  
### To download a topology from an existing deployment

1. Open the Skype for Business Server Deployment Wizard.
    
2. From the **Skype for Business Server 2019 - Deployment Wizard** page, click **Install Administrative Tools**.
    
3. Start Topology Builder: Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft Skype for Business Server 2019**, and then click **Skype for Business Server Topology Builder**.
    
4. Select **Download Topology from existing deployment**.
  
5. Choose a file name, and save the topology with the default .tbxml file type.
    
6. Expand the Skype for Business Server node to reveal the various server roles in the deployment.
