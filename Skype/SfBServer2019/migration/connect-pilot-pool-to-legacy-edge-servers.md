# Connect pilot pool to legacy Edge Servers

After deploying Skype for Business Server 2019, you need to configure a federation route for your site. In order to use the federated route that is being used by the legacy installation, Skype for Business Server 2019 must be configured to use this route. 
  
To enable the Skype for Business Server 2019 site to use the Director and Edge Server of the legacy deployment, use Topology Builder to associate the legacy Edge pool.
  
### To associate the legacy Edge pool by using Topology Builder

1. Open Topology Builder. 
    
2. Select your site, which is directly below the **Skype for Business Server** node. 
    
3. On the **Actions** menu, click **Edit Properties**.
    
4. In the left pane, select **Federation route**.
    
5. Under **Site federation route assignment**, select **Enable SIP federation**, and then select the legacy Director, or the legacy Edge Server if no Director is listed.
  
6. Click **OK** to close the **Edit Properties** page. 
    
7. In Topology Builder, under the Skype for Business Server 2019 node, navigate to the **Standard Edition server** or **Enterprise Edition Front End pools**, right-click the pool, and then click **Edit Properties**.
    
8. Under **Associations**, select the check box next to **Associate Edge pool (for media components)**. 
    
9. From the list, select the legacy Edge Server. 
  
10. Click **OK** to close the **Edit Properties** page. 
    
11. In **Topology Builder**, select the top-most node, **Skype for Business Server**.
    
12. From the **Action** menu, click **Publish Topology**, and then click **Next**.
    
13. When the **Publishing wizard** completes, click **Finish**.
