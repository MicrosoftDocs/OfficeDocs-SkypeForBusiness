# Back up systems and data
[]
Before you begin the migration to Lync Server 2013, we strongly recommend that you perform a full system backup and document your existing system, including an inventory of user accounts that are homed on each pool, so that you can roll back to Lync Server 2010 if it becomes necessary. Multiple tools and programs are available for backing up and restoring data, settings, and systems. 
  
For details and procedures, see [Backing Up and Restoring Lync Server 2010](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=265417) .
