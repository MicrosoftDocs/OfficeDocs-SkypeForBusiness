The deployment of Skype for Business Server 2019 requires using Topology Builder to define your topology and the components you want to deploy, preparing your environment for deployment of the Skype for Business Server 2019 components, publishing your topology design on the first Front End Server, and then installing and configuring Skype for Business Server 2019 software for the components for your deployment. When completed, your Skype for Business Server 2019 pilot pool deployment will coexist with an existing legacy pool."
