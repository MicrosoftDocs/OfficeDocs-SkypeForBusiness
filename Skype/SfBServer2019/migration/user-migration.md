# User migration

The accepted best practice for migrations is to create several test users and use them to conduct systems tests. After you successfully move and test those accounts, you should identify a group of pilot production users and move their accounts and conduct validation tests on them. When you get satisfactory results, you can move the rest of your users to the new deployment.
