# Exchange Unified Messaging Online migration support  

In reference to the [announcement](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/exchange/2019/02/08/retiring-unified-messaging-in-exchange-online/) on February 8, 2019, Microsoft is retiring the Exchange Unified Messaging Online (ExchUMO) service by February 2020. This article offers a summary of what affected customers should know and do to plan for their business continuity. 
 
ExchUMO is deployed by customers for voicemail, Auto Attendant, and/or fax integration services. Microsoft plans to help these customers migrate to its cloud-based services that support thousands of customers already on Skype for Business Online and Microsoft Teams. 

Voicemail is primarily a Microsoft-driven migration; admin involvement and/or investment might be required for a subset of customers. Auto Attendant is an admin-driven migration; you will need to re-create the existing ExchUMO Auto Attendant trees in the Cloud Auto Attendant cloud service. Customers who are consuming any of the ExchUMO features with a third-party PBX will not be migrated to Skype cloud services because they do not support third-party PBX systems. A retirement plan for third-party support was announced last year in [this blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/exchange/2017/07/18/discontinuation-of-support-for-session-border-controllers-in-exchange-online-unified-messaging
), and customers in this deployment model can migrate their users to one of Microsoft’s Unified Communications platforms/services or acquire a third-party voicemail and/or auto attendant solution for these users. Fax integration is not supported in the cloud-based services; customers will need to migrate to a third-party solution. 

### Who is affected?

Customers who are consuming any of the following features from Exchange Unified Messaging Online service are affected:

1. Voicemail service 
2. Auto Attendant service 
3. Fax integration 

> [!Note]
> Customers who are using any of the Exchange Server on-premises with Unified Messaging are not affected. 

Learn more about the user and admin experience impact in [User experience impact](#user-experience-impact).

## Migration plan overview

Microsoft has identified various customer deployments that are consuming features from ExchUMO and will be helping customers migrate based on the following plan.

## Migration steps

1.	**Get informed**
 
    Familiarize yourself with the [blog announcement](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/exchange/2019/02/08/retiring-unified-messaging-in-exchange-online/) and this article to plan a smooth migration for your users. See [Check Skype for Business voicemail and options](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/check-skype-for-business-voicemail-and-options-2deea7f8-831f-4e85-a0d4-b34da55945a8) for details on the Cloud Voicemail capabilities.  
 

2.	**Establish a Skype for Business hybrid topology**

    If you do not have a Skype for Business hybrid topology established, you need to do that to enable a smooth migration of your voicemail users. See [Configure Skype for Business hybrid](../../SfbHybrid/hybrid/configure-federation-with-skype-for-business-online.md) for more details. 

    > [!Note]
    > You do not need to migrate your users to online for the voicemail service migration. However, for on-premises users to leverage the cloud-based voicemail service, a hybrid topology is must be established.

3. **Plan your Auto Attendant migration**
    
    Admins can start migrating their Auto Attendants from ExchUMO to the Cloud Auto Attendant at any time. See [Set up a Phone System auto attendant](../../SfbOnline/what-is-phone-system-in-office-365/set-up-a-phone-system-auto-attendant.md) for more details. Microsoft plans to deliver additional Auto Attendant capabilities that customers consider critical for their migration by March 2019. Admins should evaluate the feature set and migrate their Auto Attendant instances accordingly. For feature-list comparison, see the [ExchUMO and Azure cloud-based services feature matrix](#exchumo-and-azure-cloud-based-services-feature-matrix).

4. **Plan for your voicemail post-migration validation and testing**

    Voicemail migration is Microsoft driven; Admins are not required to do anything, given that the pre-requisite hybrid topology is established. Microsoft will perform the required validation and testing to make sure users’ voicemail migration is not disrupted; however, admins are encouraged to perform testing and validation on their side.  See [Suggested test plan and post-migration validation for admins](#suggested-test-plan-and-post-migration-validation-for-admins) for a recommended test plan. 

    > [!Note]
    > Lync Server 2010 is not supported. If you are in a 2010 server deployment, you should plan a server upgrade or consider migrating your users to Microsoft Teams or Skype for Business Online.  

5. **Monitor the Admin Notification Center**

    Look out for a notification in the Admin Notification Center with further details and timeline regarding your users' voicemail migration. Notifications will be sent at least 30 days before your migration period. 

    > [!Note]
    > If you received a notification with your users’ migration timeline and would like to postpone your migration for a business-critical reason, you can do so by contacting Microsoft Support. Note that you cannot postpone your migration beyond the retirement date, February 2020. For customers who may have more questions, please contact your account team or Microsoft Support. Customers already using Office 365 can submit a support case through the Office 365 Admin portal. 

6. **Consider opting in starting from May 2019**

    You can opt in for an early Voicemail service migration by May 2019 (if you have not received a migration notification), to align your migration with a license annuity or admin staff vacations, or to avoid business-critical periods. Details on the opt-in process will be updated in this article before May 2019.

### Suggested test plan and post-migration validation for admins

When testing voicemail functionality after your users have been migrated, make sure to consider the following scenarios:

- Validate voicemail access across all endpoint types in your organization: apps and IP phones. 
- Validate with sample users that the configured personalized greetings are played to callers.   
- If your organization has a legal or compliance requirement to disable transcription for users, make sure it is disabled post migration. For more details, see [Set up Cloud Voicemail](/microsoftteams/set-up-phone-system-voicemail).
- If you have previously configured Exchange VM policies and rules, make sure they are effective.
- Familiarize yourself with the Cloud Voicemail service PowerShell cmdlets for changing user settings.  


### User experience impact

The following is an end user voicemail migration experience overview.


|Experience  |Change in user experience|
|---------|---------|
|Email notification | No change<br>No email is sent to users notifying them about voicemail account activation/migration. |
|Access to previous messages | No change<br>Users will have access to their previous voicemail messages in all supported endpoints. |
|Receiving VM in outlook, SFB Apps| No change<br>Users will continue to receive their voicemail messages in all supported endpoints. |
|Transcription | Enhanced<br>CVM transcription has a much higher accuracy rate and supported languages than ExchUMO. |
|User setting | New experience<br>Users will be able to change their preferences from a User Setting Portal (USP). Users can access their USP from a hyperlink in their voicemail email, or the User-Settings button on their SFB client; https://aka.ms/vmsettings.   
 |Features| Please see the feature-set comparison for details. |
|Outlook rules for VM messages | No change<br>Previously created rules will apply to CVM messages after migration.
 |

#### User management and provisioning in CVM 

Skype for Business new users will be automatically provisioned for voicemail in CVM service when created. No additional admin work or license is required to provision new users for voicemail. See [Set up Cloud Voicemail](/microsoftteams/set-up-phone-system-voicemail) to learn about managing the policies for existing and new users.

#### Admin Auto Attendant management experience 

See [Set up a Phone System auto attendant](../../SfbOnline/what-is-phone-system-in-office-365/set-up-a-phone-system-auto-attendant.md) to learn more about configuring and managing auto attendants.
