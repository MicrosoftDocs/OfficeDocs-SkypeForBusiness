# USB audio and video devices
The peripherals certification program ensures that USB peripherals such as headsets, speakerphones, webcams, and monitors, offer rich audio or video quality. Certified devices work out of the box (plug & play) with no additional configuration required, and offer call control with Skype for Business, Microsoft Teams*, and Lync clients. The products provide a great experience for end-users and administrators.

* For more details on call control support with Teams, please read [control calls using a headset in Teams](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Control-calls-using-a-headset-in-Teams-65d6e104-444d-4013-b8c2-f11317dd69a8)

> [!NOTE]
> **Announcing Certified for Microsoft Teams** <br/> Skype for Business certified peripherals will work with Microsoft Teams, but they will not be given Teams certification until they meet new requirements. In addition to the benefits of Skype for Business certified devices described later in this article, you will receive new benefits from a Certified for Microsoft Teams device include:
> - User notification of events and alerts from the Teams client (e.g., meeting starting, voicemail or missed call)
> - Ability to activate the Teams client or respond to notification with a press of the button (e.g., to join a meeting).  
>  
>Certified for Microsoft Teams peripherals will include both new devices designed from the start for Microsoft Teams as well as some currently Certified for Skype for Business devices with most of the new functionality via a firmware update.
