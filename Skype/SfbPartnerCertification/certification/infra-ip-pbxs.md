# IP PBXs

IP PBXs that have been tested by Microsoft such that specific configurations have obtained the ‘Works with Skype for Business’ designation (where applicable with known limitations). Review the following table.

|Vendor|Product                  |Software Version  |
|:-----|:---------               |:---------|
|Avaya | Aura Session Manager 6.1| 6.1.7.0.617012SP7 |
|Cisco |Cisco Unified Communications Manager| UCM 9.1.2-12900-1|
|      |         |         |


These devices have not gone through the formal certification program nor was testing requested by the vendor. These configurations utilize the commercially available production SIP trunk interface of the IP-PBX vendor but may not be supported by the IP-PBX vendor. In addition, IP-PBX vendor-provided complete documentation for installation and set-up, release notes, or documented support processes may not be available. Wherever possible, Microsoft will endeavor to provide documentation for installation and set-up.

All IP PBXs tested with Lync Server 2013 are forward compatible and supported with Skype for Business 2015. Review the Lync Server 2013 supported and qualified [IP PBXs and Gateways](../lync-cert/qualified-ip-pbx-gateway.md).
