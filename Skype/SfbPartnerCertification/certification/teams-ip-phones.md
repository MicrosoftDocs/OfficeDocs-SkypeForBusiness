# IP Phones certified for Microsoft Teams
The IP Phones certification program ensures that customers using certified desk phones and conference phones will experience high quality audio calls and meetings experience. 

## Announcing Certified for Microsoft Teams 
In addition to offering customers a range of Skype for Business certified IP phones, as part of the Teams IP phone certification program, we are announcing the availability of new IP phone hardware that will be certified for Microsoft Teams. This certification program ensures a higher quality bar with higher performance targets and audio quality metrics. Phone vendors are actively working to meet this higher bar and will be qualifying against the new requirements this calendar year. Some of our partners are also working to provide support for the Skype for Business service on the same hardware as the Teams IP phones. Benefits from the Teams certified IP phone include: 
- Native Teams experience with hardware button integration and LED notifications
- Calendar integration and one-touch meeting join
- Deployed and managed via the Microsoft Device Management Solution with Intune integration

### Features for end-users
- The Teams certified IP phone will be an independent Teams client running natively on the IP phone and would bring the rich Teams user experience to a desk phone.
- In addition to having the ability to make/receive calls, the touch screen phone user interface allows users to navigate to call history, voicemail and meeting screens.
- Users can see the presence of contacts in their call history, other meeting participants etc.
- Voicemail transcription is available in the voicemail tab.

### Administrator experience
- The tenant administrator can deploy and manage Teams certified phones in their tenant via the Microsoft Device Management Portal.
- The Teams certified IP phone is enrolled into Intune during the sign-in process.
- Firmware and application updates are deployed and managed via the Microsoft Device Management solution.

If you are a vendor seeking to join the certification program, see How to Join for requirements and available programs.
