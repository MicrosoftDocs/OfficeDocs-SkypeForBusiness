# Video for Skype for Business
Microsoft tests and qualifies video teleconference systems (VTCs), and gateways for interoperability with Skype for Business through our Video Interoperability Program. Our Video Interoperability program tests:
- Video endpoints for direct registration as an end point on Lync 2013 and Skype for Business Server 2015.
- Video infrastructure for providing a gateway that allows legacy SIP and H.323 based VTCs to join scheduled Skype for Business meetings, and in some cases to conduct peer-to-peer calling with native Skype for Business endpoints.

Always check if your Skype for Business version was tested to interoperate with the video systems.

## Video endpoints
The tables that follow describe the features available for the 3rd party VTC as certified for Skype for Business. Here, we compare the capabilities of the VTC in Skype for Business interop mode to the capabilities of Skype Room Systems (Native Meeting Room Devices).

\* Skype for Business user experience with Group Series is limited to use of the Polycom RealPresence Touch Controller when Skype for Business mode is enabled. This experience is not present in the front of room view. Additionally, certain capabilities such as admitting attendees, locking spotlight, and promoting as presenter or demoting participants to attendee are not available on VTC.

\*\*  Desktop sharing using RDP from a device sends content as video over the people channel. Polycom support for VBSS is currently planned for certification.

  1. Cloud service based video interop solutions are updated frequently and don't have set version numbers. Instead of testing a specific version, cloud services have implemented real time telemetry and have live-site support process coordination with Microsoft.
  2. Features supported for Online differ from those supported for On-premise. Video interop for O365 is focused on meeting join, and does not require VTCs to be authenticated or in any way registered to the service, as long as the meeting organizer is licensed for the service. For this reason, point-to-point calling and presence status for VTCs is not supported for online video interop.
  3. Pexip support for VBSS is currently in tech preview state.
