# Meeting room devices and solutions

Microsoft tests and qualifies meeting room solutions for Lync and Skype for Business, as well as Teams.
Skype for Business will support backwards compatibility with Optimized for Lync 2013 meeting room solutions. These include:
- Lync Room Systems (also known as Skype Room Systems v1)
- Microsoft Teams Rooms (formerly Skype for Business Room Systems v2)
- USB-based audio/video end points designed for conference rooms

In addition, Lync qualified third-party video equipment providers have the option to support their devices working with Skype for Business and Teams.

> [!NOTE]
> All Skype for Business certified devices are expected to work with Microsoft Teams, but they will not be given Teams certification until they meet new requirements. More information about Teams certification will be available in early 2019.

## Microsoft Teams Rooms devices
Room system devices are designed to extend the meeting experience to the conference room. A Room system includes all the required hardware and software. These products have been tested and are optimized for use in Microsoft Teams Rooms.

Microsoft Teams Rooms manages the Skype for Business or Teams transition in a two-stage approach.  Room systems are forward compatible with the new Skype for Business or Teams services while maintaining the same client user experience. Meanwhile, devices will continue to receive client updates.  Microsoft will work closely with its OEM partners as it transitions to Certified for Skype for Business and Certified for Teams during this process. Finally, customers will be able to follow the transition process and update details via the Skype for Business team blog.

You can find detailed Lync specifications here: [Phones and devices qualified for Lync](../lync-cert/ip-phones.md).

You can visit https://aka.ms/MTRDocs for full details on Microsoft Teams Rooms devices.

## USB based audio/video end points designed for conference rooms
The USB certification program ensures that USB peripherals such as headsets, speakerphones, webcams, and monitors offer rich audio or video quality. These all support plug & play features with Lync, Skype for Business, or Teams clients and  provide a great experience for end-users and administrators. 

### End-User Experience
- Automatic selection of default audio device and prioritization if multiple audio peripherals are present
- Plug and play: once connected, a device registers on the Skype for Business client and is ready to use
- Basic call control across PC and devices with answer/hang-up, mute/unmute, and volume control.
- Audio quality (embedded in the device): no echo or excessive glitches, echo cancellation across devices, wideband audio
- Video quality: Noise, color, image detail, jitter, latency, frame rate, field of view  

### Administrator Experience
- Firmware and fixes remote software update and contractual SLA for hardware updates
- Full outline of [Lync test specifications and tools](test-spec.md)

All of these specifications apply equally for Lync 2013 and Skype for Business, hence all USB peripherals that are qualified for Lync 2013 are also certified for Skype for Business.

If you are a vendor seeking to join the certification program, see [How to Join](how-to-join.md) for requirements and available programs.
