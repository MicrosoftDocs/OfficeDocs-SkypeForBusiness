# Monitoring and Troubleshooting
Monitoring and troubleshooting tools that are certified for Skype for Business Server provide customers with real-time visibility into complex multi-vendor networks and platforms that can cause issues with the user’s audio, video, or collaboration experience. 

The tools provide network performance visibility and server-KPI (key performance indicator) analysis. They also alert against user-defined threshold, which enables customers to reduce MTTD (Mean Time to Detect) and MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve).
