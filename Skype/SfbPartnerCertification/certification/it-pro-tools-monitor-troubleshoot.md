# Monitoring and Troubleshooting
Monitoring and troubleshooting tools certified for Skype for Business Server provide customers with real time visibility into complex multi-vendor networks and platforms that can cause issues with the user’s audio, video or collaboration experience. 

The tools provide network performance visibility as well as server KPI (Key Performance Indicator) analysis and alerting against user defined thresholds allowing customers to reduce MTTD (Mean Time to Detect) and MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve).
