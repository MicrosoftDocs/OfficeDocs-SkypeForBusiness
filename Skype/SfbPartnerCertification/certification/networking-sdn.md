# SDN for Skype for Business
Skype for Business has been pioneering a whole new paradigm of software defined networks (SDN) called UC SDN, which lowers TCO while improving end-user experience. The guiding principles for UC SDN is improved visibility, control, automation, and agility.

For anyone deploying enterprise voice and/or video this evolution of networking enables a whole new paradigm shift for how end-user apps and networks effectively communicate machine-to-machine (M2M).

UC SDN allows Skype for Business to dynamically interact with the network to ensure that application-level quality and performance requirements can be met. The UC SDN program enables scenarios such as automating diagnostics, QoS and orchestration.
