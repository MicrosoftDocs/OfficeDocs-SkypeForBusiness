# SDN for Skype for Business 
Skype for Business has been pioneering a whole new paradigm of software defined networks (SDN) called UC SDN, which lowers TCO while improving end-user experience. The guiding principles for UC SDN are improved visibility, control, automation, and agility.

For anyone deploying enterprise voice or video, this evolution of networking enables a whole new paradigm shift for how end-user apps and networks effectively communicate machine-to-machine (M2M).

UC SDN allows Skype for Business to dynamically interact with the network to ensure that application-level quality and performance requirements can be met. The UC SDN program enables scenarios such as automating diagnostics, QoS, and orchestration.

This table lists the SDN solutions certified for Skype for Business.
