# IT Pro Tools for Skype for Business
The IT Pro Tools program outlines partner solutions that make it easier to deploy and manage Skype for Business in unique environments. Each partner solution provides modules with a set of IT Pro tools that manage network pre-assessments, migrations, media-quality monitoring, troubleshooting, and reporting. The flexibility of the Skype for Business platform allows for partner tools that can operate in one or several of these categories. Partners interested in participating in this program need to meet these requirements:
- Software must be commercial, off-the-shelf, and generally available in North America and either EMEA or Asia.
- Product is applicable to the category and meets or exceeds the feature requirements being tested.
- Partner demonstrates established systems integrator relationships in every region where the software is generally available.
- Partner provides at minimum five publicly referenceable customers who have used the software in question for the intended category.
- Partner provides at minimum one private customer reference that successfully used the software in a deployment of over 10,000 users.
- Partner provides established Tier 1 support system and membership in TSA.NET to manage support inquiries with Microsoft on behalf of customers.
