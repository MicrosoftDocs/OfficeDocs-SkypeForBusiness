# Microsoft Teams Certification Program

The **Microsoft Teams Certification Program** is designed to offer Microsoft customers confidence that third party solutions provide a high quality experience and compatibility when used with **Microsoft Teams**.

The **Skype for Business Certification Program** is now closed. 

Only products that successfully pass the certification tests outlined in the Microsoft Teams Certification Program receive their respective designation.
Specifications apply to each category based on, but not exclusive to, industry standards, enterprise class solutions, functional interoperablity or audio and video quality. All vendors participating in Microsoft Teams Certification Program have a premiere support contract or equivalent benefit for rapid resolution of support tickets.

If you are a vendor seeking to join the certification program, see [How to Join](how-to-join.md) for requirements and available programs.
