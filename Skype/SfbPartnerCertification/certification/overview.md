#  Skype for Business certification program

The **Skype for Business Certification Program** is designed to offer Microsoft customers confidence that third party solutions provide a high quality experience and compatibility when used with **Skype for Business**.
There are two certification levels, each having different specification requirements.

1. Certified for Skype for Business
- Certified for Skype for Business is the designation for products that meet the most stringent specifications outlined in the program.
- Following successful completion and pass of the specifications, products will be deemed "Certified for Skype for Business."
2. Works with Skype for Business
- Works with Skype for Business is the designation for products that meet the minimum specifications outlined in the program. 
- Following successful completion and test pass of the specifications, products will be deemed "Works with Skype for Business."

Only products that successfully pass the certification tests outlined in the Skype for Business Certification Program receive their respective designation.

Specifications apply to each category based on, but not exclusive to, industry standards, enterprise class solutions, functional interoperablity or audio and video quality. All vendors participating in Skype for Business Certification Program have a premiere support contract or equivalent benefit for rapid resolution of support tickets.

> [!IMPORTANT]  

> **Certified for Microsoft Teams** <br/> Partners are currently designing products to bring new value to customers for Teams certified devices. Teams certified devices will continue to bring the same great experience you've come to expect from Skype for Business certified devices, but will add new benefits based on the device type. For more details as it applies to each category of devices, please see appropriate device page on this site.

If you are a vendor seeking to join the certification program, see [How to Join](how-to-join.md) for requirements and available programs.
