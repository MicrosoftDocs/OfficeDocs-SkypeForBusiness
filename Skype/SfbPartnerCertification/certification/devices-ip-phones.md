# Skype for Business IP Phones
Microsoft has tested and certified IP phones for Skype for Business On-Premises and Online services through the Skype for Business Certification Program. The program reflects an evolution from the previous basic interop compatibility ("Compatible with Lync‚Äù) to a higher quality bar, including metrics targeting higher reliability. Phone vendors have been actively working to meet this higher bar and have qualified a wide range of phone models against these requirements. 
In the meantime, Skype for Business Server supports backwards compatibility with all of our Lync qualified IP phones.

Basic functionalities will continue to work on Skype for Business Online certified devices when a user switches to Microsoft Teams. However, in order to be Teams certified, phone vendors would need to meet the new requirements for Teams certification.
