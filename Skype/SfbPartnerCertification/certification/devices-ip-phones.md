# IP Phones

Microsoft has tested and certified IP phones through our Certification Programs, which reflect an evolution from the previous basic interop compatibility ("Compatible with Lync‚Äù) to increasingly higher quality bars, including metrics targeting higher reliability. Phone vendors have been actively working to meet this service level and have qualified a wide range of phone models against these requirements.

In the meantime, Skype for Business supports backwards compatibility with all of our Lync qualified IP phones. 

Basic functionalities will continue to work on Skype for Business certified devices when a user switches to Microsoft Teams. However, in order to be Teams certified, phone vendors would need to meet the new requirements for Teams certification.
