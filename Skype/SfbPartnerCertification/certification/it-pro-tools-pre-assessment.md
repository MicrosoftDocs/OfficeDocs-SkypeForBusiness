# Network Pre-Assessment
Network Pre-Assessment tools allow a customer to determine if their network meets the connectivity and performance requirements to handle Skype for Business media traffic.

For an on-premises deployment readiness assessment, the tool assesses the performance of the customer’s Local Area Network and Wide Area Network against user defined thresholds for quality of experience.

For an online service network readiness assessment, the tool assesses the performance of the network connection between the customer’s site and the Microsoft Network Edge sites or between the customer’s site and the Microsoft Azure cloud. The tools assess against the network performance targets as defined in [Media Quality and Network Connectivity Performance in Skype for Business Online](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Media-Quality-and-Network-Connectivity-Performance-in-Skype-for-Business-Online-5fe3e01b-34cf-44e0-b897-b0b2a83f0917).
