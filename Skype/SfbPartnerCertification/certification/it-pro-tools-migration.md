# Migration

Skype for Business Server 2015-certified migration tools let system integrators reduce time, cost and complexity during the planning, analysis, and provisioning phase of a migration from 3rd party PBXs. 

These migration tools automate the otherwise manual process of data collection from the customer IP-PBX and Active Directory, including user data and configuration settings.

The Skype for Business Server migration tools perform a variety of tasks including analyzing the data, highlighting mismatches or duplicates, that help clean up the data. This allows the creation of migration groups that are based on various parameters, such as phone number range, hunt group memberships, and so on, which allows the migration of preferred user groups along with preferred settings to Skype for Business Server.
