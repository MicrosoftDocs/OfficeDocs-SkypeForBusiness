# Migration

Skype for Business Server 2015-certified migration tools let system integrators reduce time, cost and complexity during the planning, analysis, and provisioning phase of a migration from third-party PBXs. 

These migration tools automate the otherwise manual process of data collection from the customer IP-PBX and Active Directory, including user data and configuration settings.

The Skype for Business Server migration tools do various tasks. These jobs include analyzing the data, highlighting mismatches or duplicates, that help clean up the data. This functionality enables creation of migration groups based on various parameters, such as phone number range and hunt group memberships. This action enables migration of preferred user groups along with preferred settings to Skype for Business Server.
