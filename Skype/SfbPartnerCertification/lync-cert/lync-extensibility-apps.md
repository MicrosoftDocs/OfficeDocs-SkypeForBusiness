# Lync extensibility applications
These applications take advantage of the Lync platform to fulfill a variety of business and communications needs.

## C4B XPhone Essentials

  **Lync 2013**

  **Transform your Lync client into a powerful contact search engine.**

**XPhone from C4B** seamlessly integrates into your Lync infrastructure and provides additional UC features. Enrich your Microsoft Lync experience by integrating all company contacts regardless of whether stored in your Groupware, CRM or ERP-System. XPhone allows you to effortlessly connect numerous databases (for example, ODBC, LDAP, CSV, etc.), applications (such as Outlook, Notes, Microsoft Dynamics CRM/NAV/AX, SAP, Salesforce, and so on) and cloud services (that is, online directory services), granting you real-time access via your Lync client without replicating the original data source.

Free-text search and enhanced search parameters paired with database prioritisation assure high search accuracy. Next to transforming your windows and mobile Lync client into a powerful contact search engine, users benefit from enhanced caller identification based on integrated data sources. Server-sided deployment and administration allow for a swift roll-out without modifications to the Lync client or its operating concept. The rights management can be easily derived from your Active Directory structure or security groups.
