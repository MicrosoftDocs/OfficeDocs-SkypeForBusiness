# Partner qualification processes

## Infrastructure
With the launch of Skype for Business, we will no longer qualify solutions for Lync Server. Instead, see the  [infrastructure certified for Skype for Business](../certification/infra.md).

## Lync Services
E911 service provider and other services vendors interested in qualifying their offering for Lync Server or Exchange Server must meet both technical and marketing requirements. Participation in the program is solely at Microsoft’s discretion. Upon successful completion, the product, service, and firmware combinations tested will be listed on this site.

With the launch of Lync Server, there will no longer be qualifying solutions with Office Communications Server 2007 or 2007 R2.

### Technical requirements for qualification
- Be an IP-PBX, SIP-PSTN gateway, SIP trunking, E911 service provider and survivable branch appliance vendor.  This program is not open to system integrators utilizing 3rd party hardware.
- For Direct SIP, comply to the Lync Server 2010 SIP-PSTN gateway or IP-PBX specification.
- For SIP trunking services, comply to the Lync Server 2010 SIP trunking specification.
- For service providers using an Acme Packet SBC, please refer to the document "Microsoft Communications Server "14" SIP Trunking with the Acme Packet Net-Net Session Director", available for [download](https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=3ec8a7cb-488c-4ea3-bba1-c00d59295f9c).

### Program requirements for qualification

Once all of these criteria have been met the UCOIP administrators will be aware of the status and will then place the information on the UCOIP web site.

If you have any questions on the program please contact the MSUCOIP Administrators at msucoip@microsoft.com.

### Approximate timeline for qualification
The timeline that follows shows the approximate timeline for the qualification process. The timeline diagram also indicates tasks that can be performed concurrently as well as suggested order of precedence. The times are not guaranteed since scheduling could preempt the flow.


***Partner qualification timeline for Microsoft Partner Program***

## Lync Video Interoperability Program

The Microsoft Lync Video Interoperability Program tests and qualifies partners’ video solutions to provide interoperability with Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2 and Microsoft Lync Server 2010 and to provide a premium experience for customers. Microsoft Lync provides interoperability with three different types of video solutions:
- **Video teleconference (VTC)**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A video endpoint registers directly with Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2 and Microsoft Lync Server 2010 and provides a seamless user experience so that Lync users can connect to the VTC systems as if it were another contact. The VTC system will appear with presence information and allow user to one click initiate video calls to the VTC.
- **Multipoint control unit (MCU)**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A multipoint control unit allows for multi-party conferencing by providing users the use of virtual room or video bridge where multiple parties can connect and conduct video conferencing. These virtual rooms/video bridges will appear in the OCS and Lync contact list to allow those users to connect and participate in multiparty video calls.
- **Gateway (GW)**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gateway allows connection with different network and provides Microsoft Lync access to different protocols to make video calls. Microsoft Lync uses SIP for signaling and H.263 and RTVideo as the video codec. Gateways provide access to other protocols such as H.323, H.261 and H.264. ‘Optimized for’ – IP phones, headsets, conference room systems and other devices that offer a rich and integrated experience giving customers the power to get the most out of their Lync experience and return on investment.

### ‘Optimized for'
The *Optimized for Lync Logo* is designed to help partners bring premium communication experiences to the market.

Lync users can trust the logo as an assurance that the devices have been tested to provide the quality, compatibility, and reliability that ensures the best Lync experience.

Only products and solutions that pass the stringent requirements can participate in the Lync logo program. The logo program requirements lead to an excellent experience for the customer and improved interoperability with Lync client and server software. Video solutions that meet the requirements are eligible for many benefits, such as being featured on Microsoft webpages and in marketing collateral, and license to use the logo word mark.

### Video Interoperability
The Unified Communication Specification for H.264 AVC and SVC Encoder Implementation is published by Microsoft as a result of Microsoft’s participation in the Unified Communications Interoperability Forum (UCIF) H.264/MPEG4 AVC/SVC Task Group. It defines and constrains the H.264 AVC/SVC levels, configurations, and tools used for video communication scenarios. This specification can be used for designing an end-to-end video communication system, or for designing an H.264 AVC/SVC encoder (such as a Webcam) for real-time communication purposes.
