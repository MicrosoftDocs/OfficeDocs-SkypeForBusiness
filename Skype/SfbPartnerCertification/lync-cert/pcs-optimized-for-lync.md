# PCs optimized for Lync

With software-based telephony, Lync enables workers to use their PCs as complete unified communications endpoints. PCs that are optimized for Microsoft Lync empower workers to use all the tools and features of the platform without the need of any USB peripheral. Form factors tested include, all-in-one desktops, convertible tablets, laptops and monitors*.

All of these form factors are tested to deliver:
- High-definition audio so that workers never have to worry about call quality.
- Microphone and speaker placement that is optimized to allow users to hold a conference call without the need for a USB peripheral.
- Rich, crisp video, at a variety of resolutions, and with a wide field of view, so that video conferencing is easier and more useful.

> [!NOTE]
> Monitors require an embedded camera and an embedded speakerphone both passing Lync Logo specs (including USB HID support). The display is not tested.
