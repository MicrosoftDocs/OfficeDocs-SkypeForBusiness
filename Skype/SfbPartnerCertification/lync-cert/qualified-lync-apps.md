# Qualified Lync applications
Microsoft Lync empowers organizations by bringing the power of software to communications. It integrates telephony, voice, web conferencing, presence, and instant messaging into one seamless experience. Microsoft partners extend the Lync software platform with applications that meet an expanding variety of business and communications needs.

See the [Skype for Business Applications](http://apps.skypeforbusiness.com/) page and find out about [application certification](http://apps.skypeforbusiness.com/certified.aspx).
