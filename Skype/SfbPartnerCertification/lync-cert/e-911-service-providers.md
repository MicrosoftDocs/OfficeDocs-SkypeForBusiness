# E-911 Services qualified for Lync

## E-911 service providers
E-911 service providers provide routing of emergency calls from Lync to the correct emergency dispatch center responsible for deploying emergency responders for the given client location.  Enterprises can use E-911 services to provide location-aware emergency dialing support for both hard phones and soft phones. Emergency calls using E-911 service providers are delivered exclusively over SIP trunking connections to the service provider, including the location information directly in the call.

E-911 service providers and ELIN gateways qualified for Lync Server 2010 and 2013
Microsoft Lync supports two methods of placing E-911 calls: Using a qualified service delivered via a SIP trunk, and using a qualified gateway that provides ELIN capabilities. Both provide routing of emergency calls from Lync to the correct emergency dispatch center responsible for deploying emergency responders for the given client location. Enterprises can use E-911 services or ELIN gateways to provide location-aware emergency dialing support for both hard phones and soft phones.
