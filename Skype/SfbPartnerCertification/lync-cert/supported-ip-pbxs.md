# Supported IP PBXs

IP PBXs listed in the table that follows are supported by Microsoft, although they have not gone through the formal UCOIP qualification process nor was the testing requested by the vendor.

Sufficient internal testing has been performed by Microsoft such that specific configurations are supported by Microsoft (where applicable with known limitations). These configurations utilize the commercially available production SIP trunk interface of the IP-PBX vendor but may not be supported by the IP-PBX vendor. In addition, IP-PBX vendor-provided complete documentation for installation and set-up, release notes, or documented support processes may not be available. Wherever possible, Microsoft will endeavor to provide documentation for installation and set-up.

Service Providers not looking for the transferring party details in history or diversion headers may pass the call through, however this may cause billing challenges for these kinds of calls.</li>

				<p>Known Limitations:</p>
				<ol style="margin-left:20px;margin-top:-12px;">

					<li>Comfort noise generation is not supported. As a result, comfort noise is not played on Microsoft Lync.</li>
					<li>When a Lync user declines a PSTN call routed from some PSTN trunk configurations, the PSTN caller does not get disconnected, and instead will start to hear Ring-Back.</li>
					<li>Because Alcatel sends a 502 message for a T1 line out of service or disconnected instead of a 503, failover to an alternate route will not function.</li>

					<li>Comfort noise generation is not supported. As a result, comfort noise is not played on Lync.</li>
					<li>ISDN Failover is not supported from a Lync perspective. If the Avaya PBX is being used for PSTN connectivity and multiple T1s are being utilized, a Lync client will not retry a call based on a T1 being unavailable. It may be possible to configure the PBX to not assign outbound calls from Lync to an unavailable T1, but this configuration was not tested.</li>
