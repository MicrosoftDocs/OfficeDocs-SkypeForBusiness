If you haven't upgraded your Skype for Business Online users yet, they will be automatically scheduled for an [assisted upgrade](/microsoftteams/upgrade-assisted). If you want to upgrade your organization to Teams yourself, we strongly recommend that you begin planning your upgrade path today. Remember that a successful upgrade aligns technical and user readiness, so be sure to leverage our [upgrade guidance](/microsoftteams/upgrade-start-here) as you navigate your journey to Teams.
