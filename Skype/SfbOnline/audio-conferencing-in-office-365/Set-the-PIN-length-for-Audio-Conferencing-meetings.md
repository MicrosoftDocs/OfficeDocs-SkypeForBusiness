# Set the PIN length for Audio Conferencing meetings in Skype for Business Online


> [!NOTE]
> For information about setting the PIN length in Microsoft Teams, see [Set the PIN length for Audio Conferencing meetings in Microsoft Teams](/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/Set-the-PIN-length-for-Audio-Conferencing-meetings-in-teams).

When you are setting up audio conferencing for Skype for Business, you will get an audio conferencing bridge. A conferencing bridge can contain one or more phone numbers. The phone number you set will be included on the meeting invites for the Skype for Business app.
  
The audio conferencing bridge answers a call for people who are dialing in to a meeting using a phone. It answers the caller with voice prompts from an auto attendant and then, depending on your settings, can play notifications and ask callers to record their name. **Microsoft bridge settings** allow you to change the settings for meeting notifications and the meeting join experience, and set the length of the PINs that are used by meeting organizers. Meeting organizers use PINs to start meetings if they can't join the meeting using the Skype for Business app.

## Setting the PIN length
 
1. In the **Skype for Business admin center**, in the left navigation, go to **Audio conferencing** > **Microsoft bridge settings**.
    
2. Under **Security** > **PIN length**, select the number of digits you want for the PIN, and then click **Save**.
    
> [!NOTE]
> A PIN is different from a conference ID. Conference IDs are used by callers when they join the meeting. They are used to identify the meeting. The PIN is used to authenticate a caller as the meeting organizer. 

## Want to know more about PIN settings?

- PINs can be from 4 to 12 digits; the default is 5. Numbers are only used when creating PINs. Letters and special characters aren't used.
    
- A PIN is only required for the meeting organizer when a Skype for Business user hasn't already started the meeting. If everyone is dialing in to the meeting, then the PIN is required for the meeting organizer to start the meeting.
    
- PIN security settings are applied to all of the phone numbers that are associated with a Microsoft bridge. They will be applied to all meetings that use the phone numbers associated with a given bridge.

- Windows PowerShell is all about managing users and what users are allowed or not allowed to do. With Windows PowerShell, you can manage Office 365 using a single point of administration that can simplify your daily work when you have multiple tasks to do.
