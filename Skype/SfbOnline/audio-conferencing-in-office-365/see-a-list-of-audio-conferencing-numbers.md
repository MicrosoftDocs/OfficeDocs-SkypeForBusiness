# See a list of Audio Conferencing numbers in Skype for Business Online

> [!NOTE]
> For information about Audio Conferencing numbers in Microsoft Teams, see [See a list of Audio Conferencing numbers in Microsoft Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/see-a-list-of-audio-conferencing-numbers-in-teams).

When you set up Audio Conferencing for Skype for Business users, you can view the phone numbers that are available to them for audio conferencing. This list will have all of the audio conferencing phone numbers that are available to your organization.
  
 **Looking for prices?** See [Pricing for Audio Conferencing](https://products.office.com/en-us/skype-for-business/audio-conferencing#Requirements).
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **There isn't a resource that contains a listing of all of the dial-in numbers for Audio Conferencing.** If you are looking to see if there are dial-in phone numbers available in your area or country/region, go to **Skype for Business admin center** > **Voice** > **Phone Numbers**, click **Add**, and then click **New Service Numbers**. Use the lists for **Country/Region**, **State/Region**, and **City** to filter your search. Also, if you are looking for toll-free service numbers, select **Toll-Free** from the **State/Region** list.
  
If there is only one phone number available in your organization, it will be used as the default number for all of your users. When multiple phone numbers are available, you can select the default phone number for each user. This default number will be included in Skype for Business meeting invitations.
  
You can see [Set the phone numbers included on invites](set-the-phone-numbers-included-on-invites.md) to change the dial-in phone number for a single user.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Domestic dial-in numbers are dedicated to your organization and are the only ones that can be set as a default phone number. However, international dial-in numbers may be shared across multiple organizations. 

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [updating-admin-interfaces](../includes/updating-admin-interfaces.md)]

## To view your audio conferencing phone numbers

1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.
    
2. Go to the admin center > **Skype for Business**.
    
3. In the **Skype for Business admin center**, in the left navigation, go to **Audio conferencing** > **Microsoft bridge**, and then:
    
   - You can view the phone numbers that are available for audio conferencing.
    
   - You can also view the location, and the primary and secondary languages that will be used by the audio conferencing auto attendant.
    
> [!NOTE]
> You can go to **Audio conferencing** > **Users** and select the user's properties to change the default number by choosing a new number from the list of available numbers in your organization. See [Set the phone numbers included on invites](set-the-phone-numbers-included-on-invites.md).
