# Set auto attendant languages for Audio Conferencing

The Audio Conferencing auto attendant for Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams can greet audio callers in a number of different languages when they join a meeting.
  
Choose one primary language and up to four secondary languages. The primary language that you set will be used first and the secondary languages will be used by the auto-attendant in order that you select. 
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can configure the languages on domestic audio access phone numbers only.
  
## Set the conferencing auto attendant languages

You must be an [Office 365 global admin](https://support.office.com/article/da585eea-f576-4f55-a1e0-87090b6aaa9d) or [Skype for Business admin](https://support.office.com/article/da585eea-f576-4f55-a1e0-87090b6aaa9d) to perform this step.
  
1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.
    
2. Go to the **Office 365 admin center** > **Skype for Business**.
    
3. In the **Skype for Business admin center**, in the left navigation, go to **Audio conferencing**, and then click **Microsoft bridge**.
    
4. Select the audio conferencing phone number from the list, and in the Action pane, click **Set languages**. 
    
5. On the **Set languages** page, click the **Primary language** list to view the complete list of available languages. If you need to, click each of the **Secondary languages** lists to select secondary language.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > The primary and secondary languages that are supported are listed. The order in which you select them in the lists will be the order of the languages presented to callers. 
  
6. Click **Save**.
