# Manage the Audio Conferencing settings for my organization in Skype for Business Online

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to manage these settings in Teams, see [Manage the Audio Conferencing settings for my organization in Microsoft Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/manage-the-audio-conferencing-settings-for-my-organization-in-teams).

It might be easier for you to see all of the audio conferencing settings for Skype for Business in one place.


## Assign an Audio Conferencing license

> [!NOTE]
> You can't assign licenses using the **Skype for Business admin center**. You must use the Office 365 admin center. See [Assign Skype for Business licenses](../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/assign-skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-licenses.md).

 **To assign a license for a user**

1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.

2. In the left navigation of the **Office 365 admin center**, go to **Users** > **Active users**, and then select the user or users from the list of available users.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are assigning licenses to up to 20 users at the same time, you can use the **Select a view** drop-down then choose one of the options or create your own view. Then click **Edit**, **Next** twice then select the license and click **Submit**. You can also assign licenses to multiple users by using Windows Powershell. For instructions and sample PowerShell scripts, see [Assign Skype for Business licenses](../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/assign-skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-licenses.md).

3. In the Action pane under **Product licenses**, click **Edit**.

4. On the **Product Licenses** page, turn on **Audio Conferencing** and then click **Save**. For more on licensing, see [Skype for Business add-on licensing](../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md).

> [!NOTE]
> After you assign the license, Microsoft might not appear initially in the list as an audio conferencing provider. If this happens, either log out of the Office 365 admin center or press CTRL+F5 to refresh the browser window.

## Enable or disable emails sent to audio conferencing users

![sfb-logo-30x30.png](../images/sfb-logo-30x30.png) **Using the Skype for Business admin center**

1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.

2. Go to the **Office 365 admin center** > **Skype for Business** and in the left navigation, click **Audio conferencing**.

3. On the **Microsoft bridge settings** page, select or clear the **Automatically send emails to users if their audio conferencing settings change**.

4. Click **Save**.

    You can also send emails to the user with the audio conferencing settings by going to the user's audio conferencing properties and clicking **Send conference info via email**. The conference ID and default audio conferencing phone number is included on the meeting invite but not the PIN.

    See [Send an email to a user with their Audio Conferencing information](send-an-email-to-a-user-with-their-dial-in-information.md).

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [updating-admin-interfaces](../includes/updating-admin-interfaces.md)]

**Using Windows PowerShell**

- You can also use the Windows PowerShell and run:

  ```
  Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingTenantSettings -AutomaticallySendEmailsToUsers $true|$false
  ```

    You can use the [Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingTenantSettings](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=627285) to manage other settings for your organization, including email.

## Change the sender's contact information in email messages sent to users

You can make changes to the email that is automatically sent to your users, including the actual email address and the display name of the sender's contact information. By default, the sender of the emails is Office 365, but you can change the email address and display name using Windows PowerShell and the [Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingTenantSettings](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=627285) cmdlet. To make changes to the email address that is sending the email to the users, you must:

- Enter the email address in the _SendEmailFromAddress_ parameter.

- Enter the email display name in the  _SendEmailFromDisplayName_ parameter.

- Set the _SendEmailOverride_ parameter to _True_.

You can make changes to the email sent to users, such as the email address that the email is sent from or the display name for the email by running:

```
Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingTenantSettings -SendEmailOverride $true -SendEmailFromAddress amos.marble@contoso.com -SendEmailFromDisplayName "Amos Marble"
```

If you want to change the email address information, you need to make sure that the inbound email policies of your organization allow emails that come from the custom email address.

You can use the [Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingTenantSettings](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=627285) cmdlet to manage other settings for your organization, including email.

See [Emails that are automatically sent to users when their Audio Conferencing settings change](emails-sent-to-users-when-their-settings-change.md).

## Reset the meeting conference ID

1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.

2. Go to the **Office 365 admin center** > **Skype for Business**.

3. In the **Skype for Business admin center**, in the left navigation, go to **Audio conferencing**, and in the Action pane under **Conference ID**, click **Reset**.

4. In the **Reset conference ID?** window, click **Yes**. A conference ID will be automatically created and an email sent to the user with the new conference ID if sending email to your users is enabled. It's enabled by default.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  After a new conference ID is created, the old conference ID can't be used by callers. You should notify users to reschedule their existing meeting invites to make sure the new conference ID is added to the invitations. The users can use the Skype for Business Meeting Migration Tool to update their existing meetings. To see how to download, install, and run the Skype for Business Meeting Update Tool, see: [Meeting Update Tool for Skype for Business and Lync](https://support.office.com/article/2b525fe6-ed0f-4331-b533-c31546fcf4d4), [Skype for Business Online, Meeting Migration Tool (64-bit)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=626047), and  [Skype for Business Online, Meeting Migration Tool (32-bit)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54079).

See [Reset a conference ID for a user](reset-a-conference-id-for-a-user.md).

## Reset a conference organizer's PIN

Each meeting that a user schedules will get assigned a unique conference ID. Although a conference ID will be automatically created and assigned to a user, there may be times when a user doesn't want to use this one and you want to set it to a certain number, or your users can't remember or have lost their conference ID. You can use the Skype for Business admin center and Windows PowerShell to view, change, and reset their conference ID.


1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.

2. Go to the **Office 365 admin center** > **Skype for Business** and in the left navigation, click **Audio conferencing**.

3. Click **Users**, and then select the user that you want to reset the PIN for.

4. In the Action pane, under **PIN**, click **Reset**.

Users will receive an email with their PIN when they're enabled for audio conferencing or when the PIN is reset. But if you have disabled automatically sending emails, a PIN reset email won't be sent and you will have to manually send the PIN to the user. The PIN will only be shown once after it has been reset. After it's displayed just after being reset, the PIN won't be shown anymore on the user properties; instead, ***** will be shown.

See [Reset the Audio Conferencing PIN](reset-the-audio-conferencing-pin.md).

4. In the Action pane, click **Send conference info via email**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you do this, the audio conferencing PIN isn't sent to the user.
