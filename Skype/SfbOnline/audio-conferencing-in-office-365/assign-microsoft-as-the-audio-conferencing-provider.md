# Assign Microsoft as the audio conferencing provider

An audio conferencing provider supplies the *conference bridge*. The conference bridge provides the dial-in phone numbers, PINs, and conference IDs for meetings that are created. You only need to assign an audio conferencing provider to people who are going to schedule or lead Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams meetings.
  
If you want to be able to see **Microsoft** listed as the audio provider, you must assign an **Audio Conferencing** license to the user.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you assign an **Audio Conferencing** license to a person who doesn't have a third-party audio conferencing provider, Microsoft is automatically assigned as the audio conferencing provider. You can [Assign a third-party as the audio conferencing provider](assign-a-third-party-as-the-audio-conferencing-provider.md) if needed.
  
## Assign Microsoft as the audio conferencing provider

### Using the Skype for Business admin center

1. Go to the **Office 365 admin center** > **Skype for Business**.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > When the provider is changed from another provider to **Microsoft**, the audio conferencing information for the user (Conference ID, Toll and Toll-free numbers) will be replaced. You should save this information before changing the provider. 
  
2. In the **Skype for Business admin center**, in the left navigation, go to **Audio conferencing** > **Users**, and then select the user from the list of available users.
    
3. In the Action pane, click **Edit**.
    
4. On the properties page for the user, under **Provider name**, select **Microsoft** in the drop-down list.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Because you are using Microsoft as the audio conferencing provider and there are multiple phone numbers, you can use the **Default toll number** drop-down list to select a default audio number for the user.
  
5. Click **Save**.
    
### Using a Windows PowerShell script for a small number of users

To save time or automate this, you can use the following PowerShell script to set Microsoft as the audio conferencing provider for a small number of users.

> [!NOTE]
> When the provider is changed from another provider to **Microsoft**, the audio conferencing information for the user (Conference ID, Toll and Toll-free numbers) will be replaced. You should save this information before changing the provider. 
  
You can save one or more of the following scripts as a PowerShell script file and then run it.
  
To change the provider to Microsoft for a small number of users, you can use the  [Enable-CsOnlineDialInConferencingUser](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt243813.aspx).
  
**Example 1:** You can run this script by providing a list of users that you want updated.
> 
  ```
  Script.ps1 -UserList <List of users>
  ./Script.ps1 -UserList "user01@constoso.com,   user02@contoso.com, user03@contoso.com"
  ```
**Example 2:** You can run this script by providing a .csv file that contains the email address (alias) of each user that you want updated.  
> 
  ```
  Script.ps1 -CsvFile <Path of the csv file>
  ./Script.ps1 -CsvFile ".\\CsvFile.csv"
  ```
### Using a Windows PowerShell script for a large number of users
To save time or automate this, you can use the following PowerShell script to set Microsoft as the audio conferencing provider for a large number of users.

When the provider is changed from another provider to **Microsoft**, the audio conferencing information for the user (Conference ID, Toll and Toll-free numbers) will be replaced. You should save this information before changing the provider. 
  
You can save one or more of the following scripts as a PowerShell script file and then run it.

**Example 1:** In this example, you can use this script to change the audio conferencing provider from Intercall (or another provider) to **Microsoft** for a large number users in your organization.
    
  ```
  Script.ps1 -ACPProviderName <Provider>
  ./Script.ps1 -ACPProviderName "Intercall"
  ```
  Here is the script:

  ```
  <#
  .SYNOPSIS

## What else should I know?

- A user can be assigned only one audio conferencing provider.
    
- You can change the audio conferencing provider from Microsoft to a third-party provider at any time. To learn more, see [Assign a third-party as the audio conferencing provider](assign-a-third-party-as-the-audio-conferencing-provider.md).
    
- In your organization, you can have some people who use Microsoft as their audio conferencing provider, and others who use a third-party provider. But this is more complicated to set up and manage.
