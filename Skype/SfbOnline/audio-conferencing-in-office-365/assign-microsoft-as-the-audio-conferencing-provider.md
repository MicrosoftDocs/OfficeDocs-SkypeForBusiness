# Assign Microsoft as the audio conferencing provider

To use Audio Conferencing in Office 365 with Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams, users in your organization need to have an Audio Conferencing license assigned to them. See [Try or purchase Audio Conferencing in Office 365](try-or-purchase-audio-conferencing-in-office-365.md) to get more information on licensing and how much it costs.

Microsoft Audio Conferencing supplies dial-in phone numbers, PINs, and conference IDs that can be used by meeting participants to join the meetings of your organization. You only need to assign Microsoft as the audio conferencing provider to people who are going to schedule or lead Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams meetings.

## Assign Microsoft as the audio conferencing provider

### ![sfb-logo-30x30.png](../images/sfb-logo-30x30.png) Using the Skype for Business admin center

1. Go to the **Teams & Skype for Business Admin Center** > **Legacy portal**.
    
2. In the **Skype for Business admin center**, in the left navigation, go to **Audio conferencing**.
    
3. If you see a banner notifying you that there are users who have an **Audio Conferencing** license assigned but don't have Microsoft set as their audio conferencing provider yet, click **Click here to move them**. If you don't see the banner, in the **Skype for Business admin center** click **Users**, and then select the **Users ready to be moved to Audio Conferencing** filter.
    
4. On the properties page for the user, under **Provider name**, select **Microsoft** in the drop-down list.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Because you are using Microsoft as the audio conferencing provider and there are multiple phone numbers, you can use the **Default toll number** drop-down list to select a default audio number for the user.
  
5. Click **Save**.

### Using a Windows PowerShell script for a small number of users

To save time or automate this, you can use the following PowerShell script to set Microsoft as the audio conferencing provider for a small number of users.

> [!NOTE]
> When the provider is changed from another provider to **Microsoft**, the audio conferencing information for the user (Conference ID, Toll and Toll-free numbers) will be replaced. You should save this information before changing the provider. 

  
To change the provider to Microsoft for a small number of users, you can use the  [Enable-CsOnlineDialInConferencingUser](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt243813.aspx) cmdlet.
  

### Using a Windows PowerShell script for a large number of users
To save time or automate this, you can use the following PowerShell script to set Microsoft as the audio conferencing provider for a large number of users.

When the provider is changed from another provider to **Microsoft**, the audio conferencing information for the user (Conference ID, Toll and Toll-free numbers) will be replaced. You should save this information before changing the provider. 
  
You can save the following script as a PowerShell script file and then run it using any of its input parameters.

**Example 1:** You can run this script by providing a list of users that you want updated.
   
  ```
Script.ps1 -UserList <List of users>
./Script.ps1 -UserList "user01@constoso.com, user02@contoso.com, user03@contoso.com"
  ```

**Example 2:** You can run this script by providing a .csv file that contains the email address (alias) of each user that you want updated.
   
  ```
Script.ps1 -CsvFile <Path of the csv file>
./Script.ps1 -CsvFile ".\\CsvFile.csv"
  ```

**Example 3:** In this example, you can use this script to change the audio conferencing provider from Intercall (or another provider) to **Microsoft** for a large number users in your organization.
    
  ```
  Script.ps1 -ACPProviderName <Provider>
  ./Script.ps1 -ACPProviderName "Intercall"
  ```
  Here is the script:

  ```
  <#
  .SYNOPSIS

  This is a PowerShell script to set Microsoft as the audio conferencing provider of a set of users. It's required for applicable users to have a valid PSTN Conferencing license assigned before their provider is changed.

  continue;

  }
   else

  Write-Warning "The provider of $user is already set to Microsoft."
  }
  }
  else
              {
  Write-Error "$user does not have valid Audio Conferencing license assigned."
  }
  }
