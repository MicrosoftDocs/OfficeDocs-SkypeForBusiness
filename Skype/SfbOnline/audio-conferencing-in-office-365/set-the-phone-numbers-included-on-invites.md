# Set the phone numbers included on invites in Skype for Business Online

> [!Note]
> For information about meeting invite phone numbers in Microsoft Teams, see [Set the phone numbers included on invites in Microsoft Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/set-the-phone-numbers-included-on-invites-in-teams).

Audio Conferencing in Office 365 enables users in your organization to create Skype for Business meetings, and then allow users to dial in to those meetings using a phone. In Office 365, you have the option of using a Microsoft audio conferencing bridge or a third-party audio conferencing bridge that is hosted by an approved audio conferencing provider (ACP).
  
> [!NOTE]
> There isn't a resource that contains a listing of all of the dial-in numbers for Audio Conferencing. If you are looking to see if there are dial-in phone numbers available in your area or country/region, use the **Skype for Business admin center** > **Voice** > **Phone Numbers**, click **Add** then **New Service Numbers**. Use the lists for **Country/Region**, **State/Region** and **City** to filter your search.> Also, if you are looking for toll free service numbers, select **Toll-Free** from the **State/Region** list.
  
A conferencing bridge gives you a set of dial-in phone numbers for your organization. All of them can be used to join the meetings that a meeting organizer has created, but you can select which ones will be included on their meeting invites.
  
> [!NOTE]
> There can be a maximum of one toll and one toll-free phone number on the meeting invite for a meeting organizer, but there is also a link located at the bottom of each meeting invite that opens the full list of all dial-in phone numbers that can be used to join a meeting. 

> [!NOTE]

## Set the default dial-in phone number for a meeting organizer

1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.
    
2. Choose **Admin centers** > **Skype for Business**.
    
3. Choose **Users**.

4. Choose the users you want to edit:
    
   - To select a single user, select the user's name.
    
   - To select all users on the page, select the box next to **Display name** at the top of the list.

5. In the right panel, choose **Edit**.
    
    ![Choose the edit icon.](../images/5dd7c5bc-b8fa-4201-b6a6-1436ad8f88fb.png)
  
6. Choose **Audio conferencing**.
    
7. On the **Properties** page, in the **Provider name** list, choose the provider for the user. Depending on the provider, complete the following boxes.
    
   - **Microsoft is the provider**: Use the **Default toll number** and **Default toll-free number** lists to select the default numbers for the user.
    
     > [!NOTE]
     > At least one toll-free number must be assigned to your conferencing bridge before it can be set as the default toll-free number of a user. To get a toll-free number, see [Getting service phone numbers for Skype for Business](../what-is-phone-system-in-office-365/getting-service-phone-numbers.md). 
  
   - **A third-party is the provider**: Use the **Toll number** and **Toll-free number** fields to enter the numbers for the user.


## Reset audio conferencing phone numbers

1. In the **Skype for Business admin center**, choose **Audio conferencing**.
    
2. At the top of the page, choose **Users**.
    
3. Choose the users you want to reset, and then in the Action pane, click **Clear**.
    
By default, when you change a user's conferencing settings, an email is sent to the user. To change this, see [Enable or disable sending emails when Audio Conferencing settings change](enable-or-disable-sending-emails-when-their-settings-change.md).
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you change a user's audio conferencing settings, recurring and future Skype for Business meetings must be updated and sent to attendees.
