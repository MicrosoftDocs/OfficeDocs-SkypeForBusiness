# Turn on or off entry and exit announcements for meetings in Skype for Business Online

> [!Note]
> For information about entry and exit announcements in Microsoft Teams, see [Turn on or off entry and exit announcements for meetings in Microsoft Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/turn-on-or-off-entry-and-exit-announcements-for-meetings-in-teams).

When you are setting up Audio Conferencing in Office 365, you will get an audio conferencing bridge. A conferencing bridge can contain one or more phone numbers that people will use to call in to a Skype for Business meeting. 
  
The conferencing bridge answers a call for a user who is dialing in to a meeting using a phone. The conferencing bridge answers the caller with voice prompts from a conferencing auto attendant, and then, depending on your settings, can play notifications, ask callers to record their name, and set up the PIN security. A PIN is given to a Skype for Business meeting organizer, and it allows them to start a meeting if they can't start the meeting using the Skype for Business app. You can, however, set it so that a PIN isn't required to start a meeting.

## Setting meeting join options
    
1. In the **Skype for Business admin center**, in the left navigation, go to **Audio conferencing** > **Microsoft bridge settings**.
    
2. Under **Meeting join experience**, select or clear **Enable meeting entry and exit notifications to be turned on**. This is selected by default. If you clear it, users who have already joined the meeting won't be notified when someone enters or leaves the meeting.
    
3. Under **Entry/exit announcement type**, select **Names or phone numbers** or **Tones**.
    
4. Check or uncheck **Ask callers to record their name before joining the meeting**.
    
5. After you make your changes, click **Save**.

- When it comes to Windows PowerShell, Skype for Business Online is all about managing users and what users are allowed or not allowed to do. With Windows PowerShell, you can manage Office 365 using a single point of administration that can simplify your daily work when you have multiple tasks to do.
