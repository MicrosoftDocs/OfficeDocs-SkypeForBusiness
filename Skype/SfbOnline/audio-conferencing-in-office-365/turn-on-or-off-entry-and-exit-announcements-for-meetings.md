# Turn on or off entry and exit announcements for meetings in Skype for Business Online

> [!Note]
> For information about entry and exit announcements in Microsoft Teams, see [Turn on or off entry and exit announcements for meetings in Microsoft Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/turn-on-or-off-entry-and-exit-announcements-for-meetings-in-teams).

When you are setting up Audio Conferencing in Office 365, you will get an audio conferencing bridge. A conferencing bridge can contain one or more phone numbers that people will use to call in to a Skype for Business meeting. 
  
The conferencing bridge answers a call for a user who is dialing in to a meeting using a phone. The conferencing bridge answers the caller with voice prompts from a conferencing auto attendant, and then, depending on your settings, can play notifications, ask callers to record their name, and set up the PIN security. A PIN is given to a Skype for Business meeting organizer, and it allows them to start a meeting if they can't start the meeting using the Skype for Business app. You can, however, set it so that a PIN isn't required to start a meeting.

## Setting meeting join options
    
1. In the **Skype for Business admin center**, in the left navigation, go to **Audio conferencing** > **Microsoft bridge settings**.
    
2. Under **Meeting join experience**, select or clear **Enable meeting entry and exit notifications to be turned on**. This is selected by default. If you clear it, users who have already joined the meeting won't be notified when someone enters or leaves the meeting.
    
3. Under **Entry/exit announcement type**, select **Names or phone numbers** or **Tones**.
    
4. Check or uncheck **Ask callers to record their name before joining the meeting**.
    
5. After you make your changes, click **Save**.
