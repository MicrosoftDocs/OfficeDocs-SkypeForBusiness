# Change the settings for an Audio Conferencing bridge

When you are setting up Audio Conferencing in Office 365, you will receive phone numbers for your users from what is called an audio conferencing bridge. A conferencing bridge can contain one or more phone numbers. These phone numbers are used when callers dial in to a meeting. The phone number is included at the bottom of the Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams meeting invite.
  
The conferencing bridge answers a call and prompts the caller with voice prompts using a meeting auto attendant, and then, depending on your settings, it can play notifications, ask callers to record their name, and control the PIN settings. PINs are given to meeting organizers to allow them to start a meeting when they are aren't using a Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams app.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > A PIN is only required for the meeting organizer when a Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams app user hasn't already started the meeting. If everyone is dialing in to the meeting, the PIN is required for the meeting organizer to start the meeting. 
  
## Change the settings for an audio conferencing bridge

 **Set up the meeting experience when callers join a meeting**
  
1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.
    
2. Go to the **Office 365 admin center** > **Skype for Business**.

4. On the **Microsoft bridge settings** page, under **Meeting join experience**, select:
    
  - **Enable meeting entry and exit notifications to be turned on** This is selected by default. If you clear the check box, users who have already joined the meeting won't be notified when someone enters or leaves the meeting.
    
    When you select **Enable meeting entry and exit notifications to be turned on**, you can select these options from the **Entry/exit announcement type** list:
    
  - **Names or phone numbers** When users dial in to a meeting, their phone number will be played when they join it.
    
  - **Tones** When users dial in to a meeting, an audio tone will be played when they join it.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Using **Tone** as the announcement type is currently available to all customers as a preview feature.
  
  - **Ask callers to record their name before joining the meeting** This is selected by default. If you clear the check box, callers won't be asked to record their name before they join a meeting.
