# View and reset a conference ID assigned to a user in Skype for Business Online

> [!Note]
> For information about user conference IDs in Microsoft Teams, see [View and reset a conference ID assigned to a user in Microsoft Teasms](/MicrosoftTeams/see-change-and-reset-a-conference-id-assigned-to-a-user-in-teams).

A conferencing ID is automatically assigned to a Skype for Business user when they are set up for Audio Conferencing in Office 365 and use Microsoft as the audio conferencing provider. The conference ID assigned is sent in the meeting invite when the meeting is scheduled. Each meeting that a user schedules will get assigned a unique conference ID.

Although a conference ID will be automatically created and assigned to a user, there may be times when a user doesn't want to use this one and you want to set it to a certain number, or when your users can't remember or have lost their conference ID. You can use the **Skype for Business admin center** and Windows PowerShell to view, change, and reset their conference ID.

An email will be sent to the user with the conference ID and the default audio conferencing phone numbers, or if you reset the conference ID a different email will be sent that will include the conference ID but not a PIN. For more information about resetting a conference organizer's PIN, [go here](reset-a-conference-id-for-a-user.md).

## View and reset conference IDs

### To view the conference ID

![sfb-logo-30x30.png](../images/sfb-logo-30x30.png) **Using the Skype for Business admin center**

You can view their conference ID and send it to users.

1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.

2. Go to the **Office 365 admin center** > **Skype for Business**.

3. In the **Skype for Business admin center**> **Audio conferencing** > **Users**, select the user who needs the conference ID.

4. In the Action page, look under **Conference ID**.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can send all of the conferencing information to the user in an email that includes the conference ID and audio phone numbers by clicking the **Send conference info via email** link after you select the user on the **Users** page.

**Using Windows PowerShell**

You can use Windows PowerShell to view the conference ID for a user. To do so, run:

  ```
  Get-CsOnlineDialInConferencingUser -Identity "Amos Marble"
  ```

    See [Get-CsOnlineDialInConferencingUser](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=617693 ) to learn more about the cmdlet.


### To reset the conference ID

You can reset a conference ID for a user if, for example, they forget it.

![sfb-logo-30x30.png](../images/sfb-logo-30x30.png) **Using the Skype for Business admin center**

1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.

2. Go to the **Office 365 admin center** > **Skype for Business**.

3. In the **Skype for Business admin center**> **Audio conferencing** > **Users**, in the Action pane under **Conference ID**, click **Reset**.

4. In the **Reset conference ID?** window, click **Yes**. A conference ID will be automatically created and an email sent to the user with the new conference ID.

**Using Windows PowerShell**

You can reset the conference ID for a user by using the Windows PowerShell. To do this, run:

  ```
  Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingUser -Identity "Amos Marble"  -ResetConferenceID 8271964
  ```

## What else should you know?

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >  After a new conference ID is created or one is reset, the old conference ID can't be used by callers. You should notify users to reschedule their existing meeting invites to make sure the new conference ID is added to the invitations. The users can use the Skype for Business Meeting Migration Tool to update their existing meetings. To see how to download, install, and run the tool, see: [Meeting Update Tool for Skype for Business and Lync](https://support.office.com/article/2b525fe6-ed0f-4331-b533-c31546fcf4d4), [Skype for Business Online, Meeting Migration Tool (64-bit)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=626047), and  [Skype for Business Online, Meeting Migration Tool (32-bit)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54079).

- See [Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingUser](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=617688 ) to learn more about the cmdlet.

- The conference ID must meet the length in digits set on the audio conferencing bridge. You can't use alphabetic or special characters in conference IDs; only numbers can be used.

- The conference ID for all of your audio conferencing users will be 7 digits by default, and the number of digits can't be changed.


## Want to know how to manage with Windows PowerShell?

- When it comes to Windows PowerShell is all about managing users and what users are allowed or not allowed to do. With Windows PowerShell, you can manage Office 365 and Skype for Business Online using a single point of administration that can simplify your daily work, when you have multiple tasks to do. To get started with Windows PowerShell, see these topics:

  - [An introduction to Windows PowerShell and Skype for Business Online](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=525039)

  - [Why you need to use Office 365 PowerShell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=525041)

- Windows PowerShell has many advantages in speed, simplicity, and productivity over only using the Office 365 admin center such as when you are making setting changes for many users at one time. Learn about these advantages in the following topics:

  - [Best ways to manage Office 365 with Windows PowerShell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=525142)
