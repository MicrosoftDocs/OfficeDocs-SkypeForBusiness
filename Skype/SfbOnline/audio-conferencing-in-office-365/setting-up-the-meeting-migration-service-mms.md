# Setting up the Meeting Migration Service (MMS)

Meeting Migration Service (MMS) is a Skype for Business service that runs in the background and automatically updates Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams meetings for users. MMS is designed to eliminate the need for users to run the Meeting Migration Tool to update their Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams meetings.  This tool does not migrate Skype for Business meetings into Microsoft Teams meetings.  
  
 **Requirements**
  
MMS requires the mailboxes of meeting organizers to be on Exchange Online.
  
 **Primary scenarios**
  
MMS updates Skype meetings for a user in the following two primary scenarios:
  
- When the user is migrated from on-premises Skype for Business Server to Skype for Business Online.
    
- When an admin makes a change to the user's audio conferencing settings that would require updating the audio conferencing information in that user's meetings.
    
  **Common scenarios where you can't use MMS**
  
Here are some common scenarios that may apply to you. These are all supported scenarios for migration. However, MMS won't run in these scenarios and you'll need to use the [Meeting Migration Tool](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=626047) instead.
  
- User mailboxes are on Exchange Server on-premises
    
- Using a third-party audio conferencing provider
    
- Migrating users from Skype for Business Online to on-premises Skype Server
    
## Updating meetings when an on-premises user is migrated to Skype for Business Online

This is the most common scenario where MMS can help create a smoother transition for your users. When a user is migrated from an on-premises Skype for Business Server to Skype for Business Online, MMS will detect the new user and will scan that user's calendar for Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams meetings. Any future meetings will be updated with the new information for that user.
  
### If you're currently using Skype Server 2015 for audio conferencing

We recommend that you follow the best practices below for the best experience with MMS in this scenario:
  
- Because MMS requires the user's mailbox to be on Exchange Online, if you are also migrating from on-premises Exchange Server as well, move the user's mailbox to Exchange Online first.
    
- Assign the **Audio Conferencing** license to the user before you run the `Move-CSUser` cmdlet to migrate the user. This is because MMS also updates meetings when audio conferencing settings are changed for a user. If you don't assign the license first, MMS will update all meetings again when you assign the license.
    
### If you're currently using a third-party audio conferencing provider (ACP)

With a third-party ACP, whether or not MMS runs depends on your organization's audio conferencing settings. You can choose to automatically replace the dial-in numbers from your ACP when you assign a user a **Audio Conferencing** license. On the other hand, you may need to prevent that from happening and retain the dial-in numbers from your ACP. To see your organization's setting, run the following Windows PowerShell command and check the value of the parameter `AutomaticallyReplaceAcpProvider`. If you need help with PowerShell, see the [Using PowerShell to manage your Skype for Business organization](setting-up-the-meeting-migration-service-mms.md#WPSInfo) section at the end of this article.
  
```
Get-CsOnlineDialInConferencingTenantSettings
```

- If the value of this parameter is $true, then MMS will run when a user is assigned a **Audio Conferencing** license and update their meetings. The dial-in numbers from your ACP are retained until the **Audio Conferencing** license is assigned.
    
- If the value of this parameter is $false, then MMS won't update the meetings even if a user is assigned a **Audio Conferencing** licence. The dial-in numbers from your ACP are retained until the user is manually provisioned for audio conferencing in Skype for Business admin center or using Windows PowerShell.
    
## Updating meetings when a user's audio conferencing settings change

MMS will update an existing Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams meetings in the following cases:
  
- When you assign or remove **Audio Conferencing** license.
    
- When you enable or disable audio conferencing.
    
- When you change or reset the Conference ID for a user configured to use public meetings.
    
- When you move the user to a new audio conferencing bridge.
    
- When a phone number is unassigned from a audio conferencing bridge. This is a complex scenario which requires additional steps. For more information, see [Change the toll or toll free numbers on your Audio Conferencing bridge](/MicrosoftTeams/change-the-phone-numbers-on-your-audio-conferencing-bridge).
    
> [!IMPORTANT]
> MMS only updates meetings when you're using the Microsoft bridge. If you are using a third-party audio conferencing provider, the users will need to update their meetings manually. In this case, you can use the [Meeting Migration Tool](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=626047). 
  
Not all changes to a user's audio conferencing settings trigger MMS. Specifically, the following two changes won't result in MMS updating meetings:
  
- When you change the SIP address for the meeting organizer (either their SIP user name or their SIP domain)
    
- When you change your organization's meeting URL using the [Update-CsTenantMeetingUrl](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=836442) command.
    
## What happens when MMS updates meetings?

When MMS detects that a user's meetings need to be updated, it will do the following:
  
1. Identify all Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams meetings the user has scheduled in the future
    
   - Any Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams meetings that occurred prior to when MMS runs are skipped
    
   - Only the meetings where the user is the organizer are updated
    
2. Replace the online meeting information block in the meeting details
    
3. Send updates to all meeting recipients on behalf of the meeting organizer
    
   **How long will it take for MMS to run?**
  
The amount of time it take for MMS to migrate meetings varies depending on how many users are impacted, and the total number of Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams meetings each user has on their calendar. At a minimum, it will take 10 minutes to run. While some large migrations can take up to 12 hours, most migrations should complete within 1 hour.
  
 **Limitations and potential issues**
  
- Only the Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams meetings that were scheduled by clicking the **Add Skype meeting** button in Outlook on the Web or by using the Skype Meeting add-in for Outlook are migrated. In other words, if a user copies and pastes the Skype online meeting information from one meeting to a new meeting, that new meeting won't be updated.
    
- MMS replaces everything in the online meeting information block when a meeting is migrated. Therefore, if a user has edited that block, their changes will be overwritten. Any content they have in the meeting details outside of the online meeting information block won't be affected.
    
     ![The meeting block that gets updated by MMS](../images/210a03ee-30c1-46f3-808f-4c2ebdaa3ea1.png)
  
- Meeting content that was created or attached to the meeting (whiteboards, polls and so on) won't be retained after MMS runs. If your meeting organizers have attached content to the meetings in advance, the content will need to be recreated after MMS runs.
    
- The link to the shared meeting notes in the calendar item and also from within the Skype meeting also will be overwritten. Note that the actual meeting notes stored in OneNote will still be there, it is only the link to the shared notes that gets overwritten.
    
- Meetings with more than 250 attendees (including the organizer) won't be migrated.
    
- Some UNICODE characters in the body of the invite may be incorrectly updated to one of the following special characters: ï, ¿, ½, �.
    
### What will the users see when MMS updates their meetings?

Just like the Meeting Migration Tool, MMS sends meeting updates on behalf of users. Therefore, the only thing your users will see is another round of meeting acceptance notifications for their meetings. This might be confusing for users, so we recommend that you notify your users in advance not only when you migrate them from on-premises to Skype for Business Online, but also when you make audio conferencing changes that will trigger MMS.
  
## Managing MMS

You need to use Windows PowerShell to manage MMS and check the status of ongoing migrations. The information in this section assumes that you're familiar with using PowerShell to manage your Skype for Business organization. If you are new to PowerShell, see the [Using PowerShell to manage your Skype for Business organization](setting-up-the-meeting-migration-service-mms.md#WPSInfo) section at the end of this article.

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [updating-admin-interfaces](../includes/updating-admin-interfaces.md)]
  
### How do I check the status of meeting migrations?

You use the  `Get-CsMeetingMigrationStatus` cmdlet to check the status of meeting migrations. Below are some examples.
  
To get a summary status of all MMS migrations, run the following command:
  
```
Get-CsMeetingMigrationStatus -SummaryOnly
```

This will give you a tabular view of all migration states like this:
  
State UserCount---------------<br/> Pending 21<br/>InProgress 6<br/> Failed 2 <br/> Succeeded 131
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you see any migrations that have failed, take action to resolve these issues as soon as possible. People won't be able to dial-in to the meetings organized by those users until you address these. See the [What do I do if there is an error?](setting-up-the-meeting-migration-service-mms.md#Troubleshooting) section for more information.
  
To get full details of all migrations within a specific time period, you can use the  `StartTime` and `EndTime` parameters. For example, the following command will return full details on all migrations that occurred from October 1, 2016 to October 8, 2016.
  
```
Get-CsMeetingMigrationStatus -StartTime "10/1/2016" -EndTime "10/8/2016"
```

You also may want to check the status of the migration for a specific user, and you can use the  `UserId` parameter for that. For example, the following command will return the status for the user ashaw@contoso.com:
  
```
Get-CsMeetingMigrationStatus -UserId "ashaw@contoso.com"
```

### What do I do if there is an error?
<a name="Troubleshooting"> </a>

When you run the  `Get-CsMeetingMigrationStatus` cmdlet to get a summary view and notice that there are migrations in Failed state, here's what you need to do:
  
1. Determine which users are affected. Run the following command to get the list of affected users, and the specific error that was reported:
    
   ```
   Get-CsMeetingMigrationStatus | Where {$_.State -eq "Failed"} | Format-Table UserId,LastErrorMessage
   ```

2. For each of those user, run the [Meeting Migration Tool](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=626047) to manually migrate their meetings.
    
3. If migration still doesn't work with the Meeting Migration Tool, you have two options:
    
   - Have the users create new Skype meetings.
    
   - [Contact support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=518322).
    
### Enabling and disabling MMS
<a name="Troubleshooting"> </a>

MMS is enabled by default for all organizations, but it can be disabled as needed. For example, if you want to manually migrate all meetings or if you use a third-party audio conferencing provider, you may not need MMS running. You may also choose to temporarily disable MMS. For example, you may be doing substantial changes to the audio conferencing settings for your organization and you don't want MMS to run until all changes are completed.
  
To see if MMS is enabled for your organization, run the following command and check the value for the  `MeetingMigrationEnabled` parameter. If this parameter is set to$true, MMS is enabled.
  
```
Get-CsTenantMigrationConfiguration
```

To disable MMS, run the following command:
  
```
Set-CsTenantMigrationConfiguration -MeetingMigrationEnabled $false
```

To enable MMS, run the following command:
  
```
Set-CsTenantMigrationConfiguration -MeetingMigrationEnabled $true
```

### Enabling and disabling MMS only for audio conferencing changes
<a name="Troubleshooting"> </a>

You can also disable MMS only for audio conferencing changes. It will still run when a user is migrated from Skype for Business on-premises to Skype for Business Online. To check the current MMS status for audio conferencing updates, run the following command and check the value for the  `AutomaticallyMigrateUserMeetings` parameter. If this parameter is set to$true, MMS is set to update user meetings when audio conferencing settings are changed.
  
```
Get-CsOnlineDialInConferencingTenantSettings
```

To disable MMS for audio conferencing, run the following command:
  
```
Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingTenantSettings -AutomaticallyMigrateUserMeetings $false
```

To enable MMS for audio conferencing, run the following command:
  
```
Set-CsOnlineDialInConferencingTenantSettings  -AutomaticallyMigrateUserMeetings $true
```

### How do I run Meeting Migration manually for a user?
<a name="Troubleshooting"> </a>

In addition to the automatic meeting migrations, you can also run the meeting migration manually for a user by running the cmdlet **Start-CsExMeetingMigration**. This cmdlet adds the user in meeting migration queue. Meeting Migration Service will read the user request and migrate their meetings. You can check the status of meeting migration by cmdlet **Get-CsMeetingMigrationStatus**.
  
Here is an example that kicks off meeting migration for the user ashaw@contoso.com:
  
```
Start-CsExMeetingMigration -Identity ashaw@contoso.com
```

## Using PowerShell to manage your Skype for Business organization
<a name="WPSInfo"> </a>

 **Check that you are running Windows PowerShell version 3.0 or higher**
  
1. To verify that you are running version 3.0 or higher: **Start Menu** > **Windows PowerShell**.
    
2. Check the version by typing  _Get-Host_ in the **Windows PowerShell** window.
    
3. If you don't have version 3.0 or higher, you need to download and install updates to Windows PowerShell. See [Windows Management Framework 4.0 ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=716845) to download and update Windows PowerShell to version 4.0. Restart your computer when you are prompted.
    
4. You will also need to install the Windows PowerShell module for Skype for Business Online that enables you to create a remote Windows PowerShell session that connects to Skype for Business Online. This module, which is supported only on 64-bit computers, can be downloaded from the Microsoft Download Center at [Windows PowerShell Module for Skype for Business Online](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=294688). Restart your computer if you are prompted.
