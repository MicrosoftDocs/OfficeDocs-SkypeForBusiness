# Try or purchase Audio Conferencing in Office 365

Sometimes people in your organization will need to use a phone to call in to a meeting. Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams include the Audio Conferencing feature for just this situation! People can call into Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams meetings using a phone, instead of using the Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams app on a mobile device or PC. 
  
You only need to set up audio conferencing for people who plan to schedule or lead meetings. Meeting attendees who call in to the meeting don't need any licenses assigned to them and don't need other setup. 
  
For pricing info, see [Pricing for Audio Conferencing](https://products.office.com/en-us/skype-for-business/audio-conferencing#Requirements).
  
## Step 1: Buy and assign Audio Conferencing licenses

You must be an [About Office 365 admin roles](http://support.office.com/article/da585eea-f576-4f55-a1e0-87090b6aaa9d) to perform these steps.
  
### To buy and assign user Audio Conferencing licenses:

1. Find out if **Audio Conferencing** is available in your country/region. [Countries and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](../country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md). 
    
2. Get your **Audio Conferencing** licenses. If you want to:
    
  - **Try it** before you buy it, you can sign up for an Office 365 Enterprise E5 free trial that includes Audio Conferencing. See [Office 365 Enterprise E5 Trial](https://portal.office.com/Signup?OfferId=101bde18-5ffb-4d79-a47b-f5b2c62525b3).
    
  - **Buy it**, see [Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md).
    
3. [Assign or remove licenses for Office 365 for business](http://support.office.com/article//997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc) you purchased to the people in your organization who are going to schedule or lead meetings.
    
4. If you purchased audio conferencing add-on licenses and Communications Credits licenses, assign them too. For instructions, see [Assign Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams licenses](../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/assign-skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-licenses.md).
    
### To buy and assign pay-per-minute Audio Conferencing licenses:

If you're a Volume and Licensing customer, you can get pay-per-minute Audio Conferencing licenses. For additional information on pay-per-minute Audio Conferencing licenses, see [Audio Conferencing pay-per-minute](../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/audio-conferencing-pay-per-minute.md). 
  
1. Find out if **Audio Conferencing** is available in your country/region. [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](../country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md). 
    
2. Get your **Audio Conferencing** licenses. To acquire pay-per-minute licenses, please contact your account representative.
    
3. [Set up Communications Credits for your organization](../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/set-up-communications-credits-for-your-organization.md) for your organization. To set up Communications Credits, see [What are Communications Credits?](../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/what-are-communications-credits.md)
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If Communications Credits haven't been set up, Audio Conferencing won't work for any users with pay-per-minute licenses. 
  
4. [Assign or remove licenses for Office 365 for business](http://support.office.com/article/997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc) you purchased to the people in your organization who are going to schedule or lead meetings.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have Audio Conferencing pay-per-minute licenses, you don't have to assign Communications Credits licenses separately to each user specifically for Audio Conferencing usage (you might still need to assign them for other services). 
  
## Step 2: Set the audio conferencing provider for people who lead or schedule meetings

When you assign an **Audio Conferencing** license to people in your organization who lead or schedule meetings, they are all set up and ready to go! (You don't have to set their audio conferencing provider.) But if you have users who have been using a third-party audio conferencing provider (ACP), you will need to [Moving a user's audio conferencing provider to Microsoft](moving-a-user-s-audio-conferencing-provider-to-microsoft.md).
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you want to use a third-party ACP, choose **Audio conferencing** > **Microsoft bridge**. At the bottom of the page, click **If you would like to configure a third-party audio conferencing provider instead, click here**. 
  
## Step 3: Other admin tasks

The following steps are **optional**, but a lot of admins like to do them:
  
1. [Customize meeting invitations](../set-up-skype-for-business-online/customize-meeting-invitations.md). The dial-in numbers that are set for the user will be automatically added to the meeting invitations that are sent to attendees. However, you can add your own help and legal links, a text message, and small company graphic.
    
2. [Set the phone numbers included on invites](set-the-phone-numbers-included-on-invites.md). This is the phone number that will show up in the meeting that is scheduled by a user.
    
3. [Set auto attendant languages for Audio Conferencing](set-auto-attendant-languages-for-audio-conferencing.md) that the Audio Conferencing auto attendant uses to greet a caller when they dial in to an audio conferencing phone number. This step only applies if you're using Microsoft as your audio conferencing provider.
    
4. [Set the length of the PIN for Audio Conferencing meetings](set-the-pin-length-for-audio-conferencing-meetings.md).
