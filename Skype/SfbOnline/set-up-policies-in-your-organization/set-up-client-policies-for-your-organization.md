# Set up client policies for your organization

Client policies help determine the features of Skype for Business Online that are made available to users; for example, you might give some users the right to transfer files while denying this right to other users.
  
Client policy settings can be configured at the time a policy is created, or you can use the **Set-CsClientPolicy** cmdlet to modify the settings of an existing policy.
  
## Set your client policies

> [!NOTE]
> For all of the client policy settings in Skype for Business Online, you must use Windows PowerShell and you **can't use** the **Skype for Business admin center**. 
  
### Verify and start Windows PowerShell

- **Check that you are running Windows PowerShell version 3.0 or higher**
    
1. To verify that you are running version 3.0 or higher: **Start Menu** > **Windows PowerShell**.
    
2. Check the version by typing  _Get-Host_ in the **Windows PowerShell** window.
    
3. If you don't have version 3.0 or higher, you need to download and install updates to Windows PowerShell. See [Windows Management Framework 4.0 ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=716845) to download and update Windows PowerShell to version 4.0. Restart your computer when you are prompted.
    
4. You will also need to install the Windows PowerShell module for Skype for Business Online that enables you to create a remote Windows PowerShell session that connects to Skype for Business Online. This module, which is supported only on 64-bit computers, can be downloaded from the Microsoft Download Center at [Windows PowerShell Module for Skype for Business Online](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=294688). Restart your computer if you are prompted.
    
    If you need to know more, see [Connect to all Office 365 services in a single Windows PowerShell window](https://technet.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/dn568015.aspx).
    
- **Start a Windows PowerShell session**
    
1. From the **Start Menu** > **Windows PowerShell**.
    
2. In the **Windows PowerShell** window, connect to your Office 365 organization by running:
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > You only have to run the **Import-Module** command the first time you use the Skype for Business Online Windows PowerShell module.

   ```      
    Import-Module "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Skype for Business Online\Modules\SkypeOnlineConnector\SkypeOnlineConnector.psd1"
    $credential = Get-Credential
    $session = New-CsOnlineSession -Credential $credential
    Import-PSSession $session
   ```

   If you want more information about starting Windows PowerShell, see [Connect to all Office 365 services in a single Windows PowerShell window](https://technet.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/dn568015.aspx) or [Connecting to Skype for Business Online by using Windows PowerShell](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn362795%28v=ocs.15%29.aspx).
