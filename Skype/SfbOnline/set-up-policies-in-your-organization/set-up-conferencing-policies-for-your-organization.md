# Set up conferencing policies for your organization

Conferencing is an important part of Skype for Business Online: conferencing enables groups of users to come together online to view slides and video, share applications, exchange files, and otherwise communicate and collaborate.
  
It's important for you to maintain control over conferences and conference settings. In some cases, there might be security concerns: by default, anyone, including unauthenticated users, can participate in meetings and save any of the slides or handouts distributed during those meetings. In addition, there might be occasional legal concerns. For example, by default ,meeting participants are allowed to make annotations on shared content; however, these annotations are not saved when the meeting is archived. If your organization is required to keep a record of all electronic communication, you might want to disable annotations. 
  
In Skype for Business Online, conferences are managed by using conferencing policies. Conferencing policies determine the features and capabilities that can be used in a conference, including everything from whether or not the conference can include IP audio and video to the maximum number of people who can attend a meeting. Conferencing policies can be configured at the global scope or at the per-user scope. This provides administrators with enormous flexibility when it comes to deciding which capabilities will be made available to which users.
  
Policy settings can be configured at the time a policy is created, or you can use the **Set-CsConferencingPolicy** cmdlet to modify the settings of an existing policy.
  
## Set your conferencing policies

> [!NOTE]
> For all of the conferencing policy settings in Skype for Business Online, you must use Windows PowerShell and you **can't use** the **Skype for Business admin center**. 
  
### Verify and start Windows PowerShell

- **Check that you are running Windows PowerShell version 3.0 or higher**
    
1. To verify that you are running version 3.0 or higher: **Start Menu** > **Windows PowerShell**.
    
2. Check the version by typing  _Get-Host_ in the **Windows PowerShell** window.
    
3. If you don't have version 3.0 or higher, you need to download and install updates to Windows PowerShell. See [Windows Management Framework 4.0 ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=716845) to download and update Windows PowerShell to version 4.0. Restart your computer when you are prompted.
    
4. You will also need to install the Windows PowerShell module for Skype for Business Online that enables you to create a remote Windows PowerShell session that connects to Skype for Business Online. This module, which is supported only on 64-bit computers, can be downloaded from the Microsoft Download Center at [Windows PowerShell Module for Skype for Business Online](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=294688). Restart your computer if you are prompted.
    
    If you need to know more, see [Connect to all Office 365 services in a single Windows PowerShell window](https://technet.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/dn568015.aspx).
    
- **Start a Windows PowerShell session**
    
1. From the **Start Menu** > **Windows PowerShell**.
    
2. In the **Windows PowerShell** window, connect to your Office 365 organization by running:
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > You only have to run the **Import-Module** command the first time you use the Skype for Business Online Windows PowerShell module.

   ```      
    Import-Module "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Skype for Business Online\Modules\SkypeOnlineConnector\SkypeOnlineConnector.psd1"
    $credential = Get-Credential
    $session = New-CsOnlineSession -Credential $credential
    Import-PSSession $session
   ```

   If you want more information about starting Windows PowerShell, see [Connect to all Office 365 services in a single Windows PowerShell window](https://technet.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/dn568015.aspx) or [Set up your computer for Windows PowerShell](../set-up-your-computer-for-windows-powershell/set-up-your-computer-for-windows-powershell.md).
    
### Block file transfers and desktop sharing during meetings

- To create a new policy for these settings, run:
  > 
  > ```
  > New-CsConferencingPolicy -Identity DesktopConferencingPolicy -EnableAppDesktopSharing None  $true -EnableFileTransfer $false
  > ```
  > See more on the [New-CsConferencingPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt779148.aspx) cmdlet.
    
- To grant the new policy you created to all users in your organization, run:
  > 
  > ```
  > Grant-CsConferencingPolicy -Identity "amos.marble@contoso.com" -PolicyName DesktopConferencingPolicy
  > ```
  > See more on the [Grant-CsConferencingPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt779156.aspx) cmdlet.
    
  If you have already created a policy, you can use the [Set-CsConferencingPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt779157.aspx) cmdlet to make changes to the existing policy, and then use the[Grant-CsConferencingPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt779156.aspx) cmdlet to apply the settings to your users.
  
### Block recording of conferences and prevent anonymous meeting participants

- To create a new policy for these settings, run: 
  > 
  > ```
  > New-CsConferencingPolicy -Identity ConferencingPolicy -AllowAnonymousParticipantsInMeetings  $false -AllowConferenceRecording $false
  > ```
  > See more on the [New-CsConferencingPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt779148.aspx) cmdlet.
    
- To grant the new policy you created to Amos Marble, run:
  > 
  > ```
  >  Grant-CsConferencingPolicy -Identity "amos.marble@contoso.com" -PolicyName ConferencingPolicy
  > ```
  > See more on the [Grant-CsConferencingPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt779156.aspx) cmdlet.
    
If you have already created a policy, you can use the [Set-CsConferencingPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt779157.aspx) cmdlet to make changes to the existing policy, and then use the [Grant-CsConferencingPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt779156.aspx) cmdlet to apply the settings to your users.
  
### Block anonymous participants from recording meetings and external users from saving meeting content

- To create a new policy for these settings, run:  
  > 
  > ```
  > New-CsConferencingPolicy -Identity BlockedConferencingPolicy  -AllowExternalUsersToRecordMeeting  $false -AllowExternalUsersToSaveContent $false 
  > ```
  > See more on the [New-CsConferencingPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt779148.aspx) cmdlet.
    
- To grant the new policy you created to all of the users in your organization, run:
    
> 
>   ```
>   Grant-CsConferencingPolicy -Identity "amos.marble@contoso.com" -PolicyName BlockedConferencingPolicy
>   ```

See more on the [Grant-CsConferencingPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt779156.aspx) cmdlet.
    
If you have already created a policy, you can use the [Set-CsConferencingPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt779157.aspx) cmdlet to make changes to the existing policy, and then use the[Grant-CsConferencingPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt779156.aspx) cmdlet to apply the settings to your users.
