# Set up your network for Skype Meeting Broadcast

After you [Enable Skype Meeting Broadcast](enable-skype-meeting-broadcast.md) Skype Meeting Broadcast, you need to configure your network. Do this step if you want to hold webinars and other broadcasts for people outside of your business.

If you aren't experienced with configuring your firewall, consider hiring a [Microsoft partner](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=391089) to do this step for you.

To skip this step and instead add another business to your federation so you can invite them to broadcasts, follow the steps in [Allow users to contact external Skype for Business users](../set-up-skype-for-business-online/allow-users-to-contact-external-skype-for-business-users.md).

## Step 1: Set up allowed domains

Use **one** of the following methods to set up allowed domains:

## #

 **Method 1: Use the Office 365 admin center**

1. Go to the **Office 365 admin center** and then in the left nav, click **Settings** > **Services &amp; add-ins**, and then choose **Skype for Business**.

2. On the **External sharing** page under **Domain exceptions**, select **All domains are blocked except**, and enter the following domains, separated with a comma (,):

   - noammeetings.lync.com

   - emeameetings.lync.com

   - apacmeetings.lync.com

   - resources.lync.com

3. Click **Save**.

## #

 **Method 2: Use Windows PowerShell**

- From the **Start Menu**, right-click **Windows PowerShell** and click **Run as administrator**. In the **Windows PowerShell** window, type each line and press Enter.

  ```
  $r = New-CsEdgeDomainPattern -Domain "noammeetings.lync.com"
  ```

  ```
  $s = New-CsEdgeDomainPattern -Domain "emeameetings.lync.com"
  ```

  ```
  $t = New-CsEdgeDomainPattern -Domain "apacmeetings.lync.com"
  ```

  ```
  $n = New-CsEdgeDomainPattern -Domain "resources.lync.com"
  ```

  ```
  $newAllowList = New-CsEdgeAllowList -AllowedDomain $r,$s,$t,$n
  ```

  ```
  Set-CsTenantFederationConfiguration -AllowedDomains $newAllowList
  ```

## Step 2: Add Skype Meeting Broadcast domains, URLs, and IP addresses

The second step in the setup process is for you to first add domains that are needed and then add IP addresses and URLs that are required for Skype Meeting Broadcast to work.

- **Add the required Skype for Business Online endpoint URLs and IP addresses by seeing which ones are required** [here](https://support.office.com/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US#bkmk_lyo).

## Set up Skype Meeting Broadcast in Hybrid deployments and organizations

If you have a Skype for Business Online organization and an on-premises deployment of Lync Server 2010, Microsoft Lync Server 2013, and Skype for Business Server 2015 and have users both online and on-premises, there are other setup steps that you will need to do in addition to the ones above to enable your on-premises organization to communicate with Skype for Business Online and allow all of your users to be able to create and join a Skype Meeting Broadcast. To see what those requirements are, see [Configure your on-premises deployment for Skype Meeting Broadcast](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=617070).
