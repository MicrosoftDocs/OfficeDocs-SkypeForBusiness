    [Microsoft Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/Teams-overview.md) and [Skype for Business](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Video-What-is-Skype-for-Business-3a21eca4-434d-41f1-ab06-3d4a268573b7) 
    are both part of Office 365 that provide chat, phone conversations, voicemail, meetings, files, and apps together in one place. They both require 
    [**Phone System licenses**](/MicrosoftTeams/what-is-phone-system-in-office-365) to enable call control and PBX capabilities in the Office 365 cloud. The phone system 
    license is included with the Enterprise E5 license, or it can be added to an Enterprise E3 license. Licensing details are at 
    [Skype for Business add-on licensing](../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md). 

    A Phone System license allows you to replace your existing PBX system with a [set of features](/MicrosoftTeams/here-s-what-you-get-with-phone-system) that include 
    call queues, which route people who call your business to one of your company's call agents that can then fill customer service requests or put in 
    sales orders. Call queues can be used with either Teams or Skype for Business. You create a call queue for your organization using the Microsoft Teams admin 
    center and linking it with a *resource account*. A call queue's linked resource account can either be assigned a phone number or a call queue can be an option choice for an auto attendant, a directly associated phone number is optional.
    
    If you are asked to set up a call queue, this article provides an illustration of planning and implementing a simplified one for a hypothetical business.  
  
    ## Before you begin

    We assume you've already done the following: 
    - [Set up Phone System in your organization](/MicrosoftTeams/setting-up-your-phone-system)
    - [Set up Phone System voicemail](/MicrosoftTeams/set-up-phone-system-voicemail)
    - Reviewed  [What are auto attendants and call queues?](/MicrosoftTeams/answer-auto-attendant-and-call-queue-calls) to get a 
    better understanding of the Phone System features that can interact with a call queue.


- title: Assess business needs
  durationInMinutes: 4
  content: |

    Contoso Pizza is a small regional pizza delivery chain with twenty locations, and they want to convert their operation to use a virtual call center. They want 
    their call agents to log in to the Teams Desktop client and take orders using the company's existing order-taking system. The biggest attraction for them is being able 
    to expand or contract as needed without having to invest in office space for the call center. 

    A needs assessment for this company might include the following questions:

    ### How many call agents will you assign to the queue? 
    The company has 25 call agents in their existing call center. There are typically 12-20 agents active at one time. 

    ### How is their existing system set up, and what changes if any do they want to make? 
    They have an auto attendant system for the company office, and there is an option in that system that routes to retail ordering, but it only connects one or two calls a day. 
    They have a 1-800 number for placing orders for delivery and advertise it heavily. Their legacy call queue service provides a single auto attendant node in front of the 
    call queue to provide a different caller experience during business hours vs. outside business hours.

    ### Will the call center be active 24 hours a day, or have business hours?
    The queue needs to be in use from 11am to 11:30 pm, seven days a week. 
    
    ### Do they want distinct initial greetings for business hours, after-hours, weekends, holidays, and so on.
    They already know that the call rate outside of their business hours is very low. Using special greetings is optional.

    ### How are the agents compensated?
    The agents are paid on an hourly basis plus a performance bonus, and their performance is tracked in the ordering system. There was once a perception that 
    one agent was getting favored by the queue's distribution of calls, and they would like to avoid a repeat of that impression.

    ### What is the usual size of the call queue in the existing call center?
    Depending on the hour, it can vary from 5 to 30. Wait times are known to be up to 3 minutes most of the time, and 5 minutes at peak. 

    ### Do they already have preferences for on-hold music?
    They want to have custom music.

    ##	General guidelines
    Before we look at our specific example, letâ€™s look briefly at some more general design guidelines and basics. 
    
    A Cloud call queue has a limited number of options. The main decisions to make for the queue are: 
    
    - Whether to assign a number directly to the queue, or to have callers connect to an auto attendant first. Callers are unlikely to realize the difference.
    - Whether to have an initial greeting  as part of the call queue (if you do connect initially to an auto attendant, that can provide an initial greeting)
    - what hold music to use
    - how to distribute the calls among the available agents

    #### Do:
    - Keep the number of calls in queue and call wait time for callers as short as possible.
    - Have alternate initial greetings for calls taken outside business hours, or on holidays or weekends when agents won't be available. This will involve putting a single auto attendant in front of the call queue.
    - Make the call queue as easy to find as possible when your ordering number connects to an auto attendant first. 
    - Know your customers and provide hold music that will match their interests, or at least not clash badly with their tastes.
 
    
    #### Don't:
    - Pitch other products or upsell while callers are waiting on hold.  
    - Make callers wait any longer than necessary to talk to an agent.

    > [!Important]
    > The keys \* (Repeat) and \# (Back) are reserved by the system and can't be reassigned. If speech recognition is enabled, pressing \* will correspond with 
    "Repeat" and \# will correspond with the "Back" voice commands.
  

    ## Do a design mockup 
    For implementations centered on a call queue like our example, we'll either have a phone number assigned to the call queue's resource account, or have the phone number assigned to an auto attendant's resource account.
    
    *Call Queue with no Auto Attendant*

    ![pizza call queue](../images/CQ-Pizza-CallCenter.png)  

    *Call Queue with Auto Attendant*

    ![pizza call que-auto attendant](../images/AA-CQ.png)

    You could use Visio to visualize your design. The Visio file containing the diagrams above is available for 
    [download](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/OfficeDocs-SkypeForBusiness/blob/live/Skype/SfbOnline/images/CQ-Pizza-CallCenter.vsdx?raw=true). Alternately, 
    Auto Attendant and Call Queue diagrams can be planned using sticky notes or index cards.

    For a more complex initial design with multiple nested auto attendants, refer to the Auto Attendants tutorial.

- title: Writing the script 
  durationInMinutes: 3
  content: |
    ### Writing better  scripts 
    Your outgoing message scripts can make or break the impression left on your customers or callers. 
    Plan them carefully, write them out, and consider having them professionally recorded. The goal is to connect the caller to a live person as efficiently as possible.
    Think about some of these guidelines when writing the script dialog:

    #### Do:
    1.	Greet and thank the caller for contacting you. Keep this short, no more than three sentences and under 30 seconds. If your web site offers self-service 
    options, mention it but otherwise present choices and options as soon as possible without being abrupt. 
    2.	Consider using multilingual prompts, but put the secondary language or languages at the end of the first set of options.
    3.	Make sure the voice for the prompts leaves the impression you want and is clearly understandable.  Phone System has a built in text to speech 
    engine which gives you the option of entering your final text and deciding for yourself whether it's conveying the impression you want. If not, 
    using a pre-recorded audio prompt is fully supported. If your selected message voice mumbles, sounds condescending, or has other issues, keep looking.
    4.	Mention significant changes to your option structure when that happens, but don't leave that part of the greeting active for more than a month. If you 
    have frequent updates and expect that to be the case most of the time, just omit it from the script.
    
    #### Don't:
    1.	Clutter the initial greeting, keep the initial greeting short and sweet.
    2.	Say please or use other pleasantries over and over. Just get the callers to the option or person they need as efficiently as possible.
    3.	Include "http:\/\/www\." when mentioning a web address. It's just a poor use of script time.
    4.	Use abbreviations like St for street or CA for California. Spell them out in the script and say the whole word in the recording. 
    Text to speech engines don't usually do well with abbreviations.
    5.	Include sales information in the scripts, you'll annoy your callers. Let your sales force take care of that sort of thing.

    And finally, if your company has a slogan, think twice about including it in the script at all. Chances are your callers have heard it before if they're calling 
    you. If you do include it, put it somewhere it brings the caller's experience to a close, like when transferring to an individual's desk line or voicemail. 
    If youâ€™ve had a slogan or tag line for a long time that many of your customers know, it might or might not be worth including. The "golden rule" here is to 
    connect the caller to a person as efficiently as possible.

    ### Sample greeting scripts

    > [!Important]
    > The keys \* (Repeat) and \# (Back) are reserved by the system and can't be reassigned. If speech recognition is enabled, pressing \* will correspond with 
    "Repeat" and \# will correspond with the "Back" voice commands.

    These scripts reflect the designs shown earlier, and the suggested guidelines for writing scripts. 

    #### Call Queue Script 1: Call queue greeting (call queue without auto attendant)

    "Thanks for calling Contoso Pizza. If you're calling between 11 am and 11:30 pm please stay on the line and the next available agent will take your order. 
    If you're calling outside business hours, please call back soon."

    

    #### Auto Attendant Script 1: business hours greeting

    "Thanks for calling Contoso Pizza. Please stay on the line and the next available agent will take your order."
    
    #### Auto Attendant Script 2: after-hours greeting

    "Thanks for calling Contoso Pizza.   Weâ€™re closed at this time, please call back between 11am and 11:30pm to order fresh piping hot pizza!"


    Note that we don't have a script to offer phone keypad options, or a greeting for the call queue. The caller will be handed from the auto attendant to the 
    call queue without other options being offered.


 

- title: Implementing a call queue 
  durationInMinutes: 7

    The information needed to implement the design in the earlier diagram is presented in the tables that follow.
    The implementation uses text-to-speech for the scripts. Phone System has a built in text to speech engine so you the option 
    of entering your final text and deciding for yourself whether it conveys the impression you want. If not, it's up to you whether to record your 
    own prompts using recording software or have a professional voice-over artist use your scripts to record .wav files.
      
    The account used for this task must have Admin privileges. The following tables show values to enter in the user interface screen.
    
    You'll need to create resource accounts for all Auto Attendants and Call Queues. 
    See [Manage resource accounts in Microsoft Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/manage-resource-accounts.md) for details on creating a resource account.
    You'll also need to create an O365 Group specifically for your call agents.

    Set up the following in O365, in this order:

    -  One or more [resource accounts](/microsoftteams/manage-resource-accounts) 
    -  Call Agent [O365 Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/create-groups/create-groups?view=o365-worldwide)  
    -  Ordering call queue
    -  Contoso Pizza ordering line (optional auto attendant)
    -  Contoso Pizza Overflow Attendant (optional auto attendant)
       
    ### Simple call queue implementation, without auto attendant
    
    Create a resource account for the auto attendant, then start creating the auto attendant. Expect a delay of a few minutes after creating the resource account 
    before it becomes available as a selection.

    In the **Microsoft Teams admin center**, click on **Voice** > **Call queues**, then click **+ Add new**:

    | | Option| Setting |
    |:---   |:--- |:---     |
    | ![Number 1](../images/sfbcallout1.png)| Call queue name | Contoso Pizza Ordering  |
    | ![Number 2](../images/sfbcallout2.png)| Resource account  | CQ-ordering (the phone number is assigned to the resource account)  |
    | ![Number 3](../images/sfbcallout3.png)| Greeting	| Play an Audio File (recording of Script 3)  |
    | ![Number 4](../images/sfbcallout4.png)| Music on hold	| upload an MP3, WMA, or WAV file up to 5 MB large.  |
    | ![Number 5](../images/sfbcallout5.png)| Call Agents <br> Routing Method <br> Agent Opt Out <br> Agent alert time	| The call agents need to be defined as a group of O365 users. Search for and select the group you created  <br> Round Robin <br> On <br> 10 seconds |
    | ![Number 6](../images/sfbcallout6.png)| Maximum calls in queue <br> When the maximum number of calls is reached	| 50 <br> Disconnect |
    | ![Number 7](../images/sfbcallout6.png)| Maximum wait time <br> When call times out	| 20 minutes<br> Disconnect |
    |  |  | 

    This Call Queue is the simplest to implement, but that simplicity has a cost: 
    - Text to speech won't be able to provide an outgoing message, you'll have to record it. 
    - If the call queue length or call wait time reaches maximum, there's no way to apologize for a delay and put the call back in the queue. The caller is abruptly hung up on, which is really not what we want to happen to a call.


    ### Call Queue implementation, with auto attendant
    
    In the **Microsoft Teams admin center**, click on **Voice** > **Call queues**, then click **+ New call queue**:

    | |Option | Setting |
    |:---    |:---     |:---|
    | ![Number 1](../images/sfbcallout1.png)| Queue Name | <br> Contoso Pizza Ordering  |
    | ![Number 2](../images/sfbcallout2.png)| Resource account name | CQ-ordering (the phone number is assigned to the Auto Attendant resource account)  |
    | ![Number 3](../images/sfbcallout3.png)| Greeting	| No Greeting |
    | ![Number 4](../images/sfbcallout4.png)| Music on hold	| upload an MP3, WMA, or WAV file up to 5 MB.  |
    | ![Number 5](../images/sfbcallout5.png)| Call Agents <br> Routing Method <br> Agent Opt Out <br> Agent alert time	| The call agents need to be defined as a group of O365 users. Search for and select the group you created  <br> Round Robin <br> On <br> 10 seconds |
    | ![Number 6](../images/sfbcallout6.png)| Maximum calls in queue <br> When the maximum number of calls is reached	| 50 <br> Disconnect |
    | ![Number 7](../images/sfbcallout7.png)| Maximum wait time <br> When call times out	| 20 minutes<br> Disconnect |
    |  |  | 
    
    Press **Save** when you're done. In this example, the greeting the caller hears is implemented on the auto attendant, so it's not needed in the call queue.

    #### Ordering auto attendant 

    ![New Auto Attendant page 1](../images/edacec94-9384-4a87-be0a-5c49a151287e.png)

    Create a resource account for the auto attendant, then start creating the auto attendant. Expect a delay of a few minutes after creating the resource account 
    before it becomes available as a selection.

    **Edit general info** for the main menu

    |  | Option   | Setting      |
    |:---  |:---   | :---|
    | ![Number 1](../images/sfbcallout1.png)| Name  |   Contoso Pizza Main Menu   | 	
    | ![Number 2](../images/sfbcallout2.png)| Resource account | MainMenu (assign the service number to this resource account)  |
    | ![Number 3](../images/sfbcallout3.png)| Time Zone	| (UTC-04:00) Eastern Daylight Time (US & Canada) |
    | ![Number 4](../images/sfbcallout4.png)| Language	| English (United States)  |
    | ![Number 5](../images/sfbcallout5.png)| Operator	| None |
    | ![Number 6](../images/sfbcallout6.png) |Enable voice inputs	| Enabled |
    |  |  | 
     
    Only the main menu, named *Contoso Pizza* needs a resource account with an assigned Phone Number or a Company Greeting.  
    
    To continue, press **Next**.

    ![New Auto Attendant Hours of operation.](../images/61769547-cdb4-45c0-af5a-3d6e0731fbc6.png)

    **Select Business Hours** for the main menu

    | |  Option   | Setting      |
    |:--- | :--- | :--- |
    | ![Number 1](../images/sfbcallout1.png)| 24/7-Custom| Custom  |
    | ![Number 2](../images/sfbcallout2.png)| Selection|  11:00am to 11:30pm, Sunday-Saturday  |
    |||
    
    The default for this screen is 24/7.  To continue, press **Next**.

    ![Business hours call handling.](../images/2a33b1f7-d362-47a7-bf32-ef702bc878e8.png)
    ![Business hours call handling continued.](../images/2a33b1f7-d362-47a7-bf32-ef702bc878e8b.png) 
    **Business hours call handling** for the main menu

    | |Option | Setting |
    |:---  |:---  | :--- |
    | ![Number 1](../images/sfbcallout1.png)| Company greeting	| Create a custom greeting > Callers will hear: Copy/paste Script 1 above  |
    | ![Number 3](../images/sfbcallout3.png)| Actions	|  Redirect call, redirect to **voice app**, search for resource account linked to Contoso Pizza Ordering Call Queue |
    | ![Number 4](../images/sfbcallout4.png)| Dial By Name  |  Disabled   |
    | ![Number 5](../images/sfbcallout5.png)| Play menu options	| Leave unselected |
    |  |   |
    
     To continue, press **Next**.


    **After hours call handling** for the main menu
    The After Hours call handling screen is very similar to the Business hours Call handling screen.
    
    | |  Option   | Setting|
    |:---  | :---  | :--- |
    | ![Number 1](../images/sfbcallout1.png)| Greeting	| Create a custom greeting, callers will hear: Copy/paste Script 2 above |
    | ![Number 3](../images/sfbcallout3.png)| Actions |	Disconnect  |
    |  |   |

    While setting up your after hours call handling for the Main Auto Attendant, you could choose to create the same menu options used in the business hours call handling screen. Doing this would allow the after 
    hours callers to navigate the same menus as business hours callers. It's a matter of preference which approach you choose.

    Set up **holidays** and the **dial scope** as you see fit, and save the Main Auto Attendant.
  

    See the step-by-step implementation details for Cloud Auto Attendants at [Creating an Auto Attendant](/MicrosoftTeams/set-up-a-phone-system-auto-attendant.md) 
    for more detail on the options available in these screens. 

    


    ### Editing and testing Call Queues

    After you have saved your Call Queue, it will be listed on the **Call Queues** page of the Admin center. 
    This will allow you to quickly see some of the options that you have set up.
    
    The best way to test the implementation is to call the number configured for the Call Queue. You can also quickly place a test call to your Auto Attendant by 
    using the **Test button** in the Action pane. If you want to make changes to a Call Queue, select the Call Queue, and then in the Action pane click **Edit**.
