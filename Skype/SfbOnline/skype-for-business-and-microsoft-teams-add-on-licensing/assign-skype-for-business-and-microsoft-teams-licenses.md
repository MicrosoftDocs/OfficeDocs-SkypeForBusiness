# Assign Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams licenses

This article gives you tips about assigning licenses to your users for features like Audio Conferencing, Phone System, and Calling Plans. It also provides scripts for assigning licenses in bulk.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> See [Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md) for information about what licenses you need to buy and **how to buy** them - depending on your Office 365 plan - so users get Audio Conferencing, toll-free numbers, and the ability to call phone numbers outside your business.


## Phone System and Calling Plans: Tips and scripts for assigning licenses

What you need to know before assigning Audio Conferencing, Phone System and Calling Plan licenses

- **Using on-premises PSTN connectivity for hybrid users?** If so, you only need to assign a **Phone System** license. You should **NOT** assign a Calling Plan.

- **Latency after assigning licenses**: Because of the latency between Office 365 and Skype for Business Online, it can possibly take up to 24 hours for a user to be assigned a Calling Plan after you assign a license. If after 24 hours the user isn't assigned a Calling Plan, please [Contact support for business products - Admin Help](https://support.office.com/article/32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b).

- **Error messages**: You will get an error message if you haven't purchased the correct number of licenses. If you need to buy more Calling Plan licenses, choose **Buy more**.
    
- **Next steps**: After you assign Calling Plan licenses to your users, you will need to get your phone numbers for your organization, and then assign those numbers to the people in your organization. For step-by-step instructions, see [Set up Calling Plans](/microsoftteams/set-up-calling-plans).
    
### How to assign a Phone System and Calling Plan license to one user

The steps are the same as assigning an Office 365 license. See [Assign or remove licenses for Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/article/997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc).

### How to assign Phone System and Calling Plan licenses in bulk

1. Install the **Microsoft Online Services Sign-In Assistant for IT Professionals RTW**. Don't have the module installed? See [Microsoft Online Services Sign-In Assistant for IT Professionals RTW](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=625123) to download it.

2. Install the **Windows Azure Active Directory Module.** Don't have the module installed? See [Manage Azure AD using Windows PowerShell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=320628) for download instructions and cmdlet syntax.

3. Once you get the modules installed, use the Windows PowerShell command prompt and the following syntax to assign the licenses to your users:

   This example assigns an **Enterprise E3 license** along with a **Phone System** and a **Domestic Calling Plan** license.

   ```
   #Create a text file with a single row containing list of UserPrincipalName (UPN) of users to license. The MSOLservice uses UPN to license user accounts in Office 365.

   #Example of text file:
   #user1@domain.com
   #user2@domain.com

   #Import Module
   ipmo MSOnline
   #Authenticate to MSOLservice.
   Connect-MSOLService
   #File prompt to select the userlist txt file.
   [System.Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName("System.windows.forms") | Out-Null

   $OFD.ShowDialog() | Out-Null
   $OFD.filename
   If ($OFD.filename -eq '')
   {
    Write-Host "You did not choose a file. Try again" -ForegroundColor White -BackgroundColor Red
   }
   #Create a variable of all users.
   $users = Get-Content $OFD.filename
   #License each user in the $users variable.
   #Use MCOPSTN1 for PSTN Domestic Calling and MCOPSTN2 for Domestic and
   International Calling.
   for each ($user in $users)
    {
    Write-host "Assigning License: $user"
    Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName $user -AddLicenses "companyname:ENTERPRISEPACK " -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
