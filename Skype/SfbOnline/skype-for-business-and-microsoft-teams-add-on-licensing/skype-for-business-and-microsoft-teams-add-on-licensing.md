# Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams add-on licensing

Need to talk to someone about all the add-on options? [Contact support for business products - Admin Help](http://support.office.com/article/32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b).
  
Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams licensing is designed to give you the maximum amount of flexibility. For example, after using basic Skype for Business features for a while, you can buy add-on licenses when you're ready to use more features, such as Audio Conferencing, or the Phone System in Office 365.
  
 **Looking for prices?** See [How to see prices and buy add-on licenses](skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md#bkmk_how) or one of the following:
  
- [Pricing for Audio Conferencing](https://products.office.com/en-us/skype-for-business/audio-conferencing#requirements)
    
- [Pricing for Phone System](https://products.office.com/en-us/skype-for-business/phone-system#requirements)
    
- [Pricing for Calling Plans](https://products.office.com/en-us/skype-for-business/calling-plans#requirements)
    
## What are add-on licenses?

Add-on licenses are licenses for specific Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams features. Some businesses want the flexibility of purchasing only specific features at a competitive price. To add a feature, buy one add-on license for each user who is going to use it.
  
 **How does add-on licensing affect cost?** For most businesses, buying a bundle of software in an Enterprise plan will result in lower overall cost. Typically when you buy several add-on licenses individually instead of as part of a plan, you may end up with higher combined cost.
  
## What features can I get with add-on licenses?

Depending on which plan you already have, you can buy add-on licenses for the following Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams features:
  
|||
|:-----|:-----|
|**Feature** <br/> |**Description** <br/> |
|**Audio Conferencing** <br/> |Sometimes people in your organization will need to use a phone to call in to a Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams meeting, instead of using their computer. Use the Audio Conferencing feature for this situation.  <br/> To find out whether Audio Conferencing is available in your country or region, see [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](../country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md). <br/> If you are looking for how much it costs, see [Requirements for Audio Conferencing](https://products.office.com/en-us/skype-for-business/audio-conferencing#requirements).  <br/> |
|**Toll free numbers for dial-in access to your conferences, and the ability to dial out from a conference to add someone by calling any telephone number in the world** <br/> |If you add Audio Conferencing, we recommend that you [Set up Communications Credits](skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md#bkmk_billing). <br/> |
|**Phone System** <br/> |A PBX is a telephone system in a business. Phone System in Office 365 is a hosted telephone service in Office 365. It gives you both traditional and innovative PBX capabilities, but without the complicated and expensive equipment. [Here's what you get with Phone System in Office 365](../what-is-phone-system-in-office-365/here-s-what-you-get-with-phone-system.md).  <br/> If you are looking for how much it costs, see [Requirements for Phone System](https://products.office.com/en-us/skype-for-business/cloud-pbx#requirements).  <br/> |
|**Calling Plans** <br/> |Calls to other Skype for Business users are free, but if you want your users to be able to call any phone numbers outside of your business, get a [Calling Plan](calling-plans-for-office-365.md). There are Domestic Calling Plans and Domestic and International Calling Plans in Office 365.  <br/> If you are looking for how much it costs, see [Requirements for Calling Plans](https://products.office.com/en-us/skype-for-business/pstn-calling-plans#requirements).  <br/> |
|**Skype Room Systems v2** <br/> |This isn't an add-on, but a feature that brings video, audio, and content sharing to conference rooms. See [Licensing for Skype Room Systems v2](skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md#bkmk_srs).  <br/> |
   
## Guidance for Office 365 Business Premium Plan customers

If you have [Office 365 Business Premium](https://products.office.com/en-us/business/office-365-business-premium), you can use Skype for Business to make calls to other people in your business who are on your subscription. For example, if your business has 10 people, you can call and IM each other using Skype for Business.
  
 **To make and receive calls from people external to your business, you have two options**:
  
- **Option 1. Use the free [Skype app](https://www.skype.com/)**. If you have a very small business (for example, 1-2 people), using the Skype app is the better way to go. It's less expensive to use for domestic and international calls. You can still hold conference calls, make video calls, and share your desktop for presentations. [Check out the rates and payment options](https://secure.skype.com/en/calling-rates?wt.mc_id=legacy&amp;expo365=bundled).
    
    Note that the Skype app isn't part of the Office 365 suite, so it won't be integrated with Outlook 2016 the way Skype for Business is. This means your contacts in Outlook 2016 won't show up in Skype; you'll need to add your contacts to Skype.
    
    We recommend starting with the Skype app to see if it meets your needs. If it doesn't, then consider the next option, to upgrade your plan.
    
    **IMPORTANT**: You have to set a toggle to allow your employees to use Skype for Business to search for Skype users. See [Let Skype for Business users add Skype contacts](../set-up-skype-for-business-online/let-skype-for-business-users-add-skype-contacts.md).
    
- **Option 2. Upgrade your plan, and buy a Phone System and a Domestic or Domestic and International Calling Plan**.
    
1. [Switch to a different Office 365 for business plan](http://support.office.com/article/73318661-8f33-478b-bcc7-fb8d69dbb22a). If you switch to the E3 plan, you also get voicemail.
    
2. Buy the **Phone System** add-on.
    
3. Buy a [Calling Plan for Office 365](calling-plans-for-office-365.md): you can only buy this after you buy the **Phone System** add-on.
    
    This second option is ideal for businesses with several people who make and receive external phone calls.
    
## Which add-on licenses do I need to buy to get more features?
<a name="bkmk_whichaddons"> </a>

## How to see prices and buy add-on licenses
<a name="bkmk_how"> </a>

 **After you buy an Office 365 plan, you see prices and buy add-ons through the Office 365 admin center**.
  
Depending on the add-ons you want, we recommend [comparing whether it's more cost effective](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=844053) for you to switch to a plan that includes those features already.
  
Expand the following sections to learn how to see the prices and get the add-ons for your plan.

    ![To buy an add-on license, choose Buy add-on.](../images/fc4d7506-4ee9-4e39-be54-0622edffb77a.png)

2. Go to **Billing** > **Subscriptions** > **Add-ons** > **Buy add-ons**.
    
    ![To buy an add-on license, choose Buy add-on.](../images/fc4d7506-4ee9-4e39-be54-0622edffb77a.png)
  
3. After you buy a **Phone System** license, you'll see the price and option to buy a Calling Plan.
    
### Partners: How to see prices and buy
<a name="bkmk_partners"> </a>

The E3 plan is part of your Action Pack. To buy the **Phone System** and **Audio Conferencing** add-ons:
  
1. Buy one seat of E3 from our [marketing website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=24393). Choose the option to add the seat to your existing tenant.
    
2. Sign in to the Office 365 admin center and go to **Billing** > **Subscriptions** > **Add-ons**.
    
    Now you'll see the prices and option to buy the **Phone System** and **Audio Conferencing** add-ons.
    
## Why don't I see the option to buy add-ons?
<a name="bkmk_how"> </a>

In a few situations, you won't see the option to buy Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams add-ons in the Office 365 admin center.
  
- **You purchased Office 365 Business Premium through GoDaddy**. In this case, you can't buy Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams add-ons. You need to switch to the E3 plan (which GoDaddy doesn't sell), and then you can buy them. [Contact support for business products - Admin Help](http://support.office.com/article/32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b).
    
- **You have a monthly commitment instead of an annual commitment**. In some cases, customers who have a monthly commitment can't buy the add-ons (this is different from the payment method, which can be monthly). This is a known issue that we are fixing. [Contact support for business products - Admin Help](http://support.office.com/article/32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b).
    
    ![You may need an annual commitment to buy add-ons.](../images/164579c2-f4df-4ae0-bd1d-bff12addb500.png)
  
## How to set up Communications Credits
<a name="bkmk_billing"> </a>

Before you can sign up for Communications Credits, you need the following add-ons as minimum prerequisites:
  
- Phone System and a Calling Plan
    
- Or, Audio Conferencing
    
Once you have those, here's how you sign up:
  
1. Sign in to the Office 365 admin center.
    
2. Go to **Billing** > **Subscriptions** > **Communications Credits**.
    
    ![Choose Skype for Business PSTN Consumption to add funds.](../images/878ae28f-b940-469f-93b1-f86f51f8244d.png)
  
3. Choose **Add funds**. We strongly recommend setting up **auto-charge** so you don't run out of funds, which will block your users from making calls.
    
4. After you sign up for Communications Credits billing, you'll need to assign a Communications Credits license to each user in your business who makes calls. You'll have an unlimited number of licenses available.
    
    ![You'll have an unlimited number of PSTN Consumption licenses to assign to your users.](../images/9b8bf6ab-91df-47ea-927b-0b23beaed094.png)
