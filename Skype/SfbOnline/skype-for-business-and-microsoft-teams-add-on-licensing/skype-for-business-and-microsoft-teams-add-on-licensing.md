# Skype for Business add-on licensing

[!INCLUDE [sfbo-retirement](../../Hub/includes/sfbo-retirement.md)]

## What are add-on licenses?

Add-on licenses are licenses for specific Skype for Business features. Some businesses want the flexibility of purchasing only specific features at a competitive price. To add a feature, buy one add-on license for each user who will use it.

Skype for Business licensing is designed to give you the maximum amount of flexibility. For example, after using basic Skype for Business features for a while, you can buy add-on licenses when you're ready to use more features, such as Audio Conferencing, or the Phone System in Office 365.

## How does add-on licensing affect cost?

For most businesses, buying a bundle of software in an Enterprise plan will result in lower overall cost. Typically, when you buy several add-on licenses individually instead of as part of a plan, you may end up with higher combined cost.

For more cost information, see [How to see prices and buy add-on licenses](skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md#bkmk_how) or one of the following:

- [Pricing for Audio Conferencing](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/audio-conferencing)

- [Pricing for Phone System](https://products.office.com/skype-for-business/phone-system)

- [Pricing for Calling Plans](/microsoftteams/set-up-audio-conferencing-in-teams)

## What features can I get with add-on licenses?

Depending on which plan you already have, you can buy add-on licenses for the following Skype for Business features:


|Feature |Description |
|:-----|:-----|
|**Audio Conferencing**  |Sometimes people in your organization will need to use a phone to call in to a Skype for Business meeting, instead of using their computer. Use the Audio Conferencing feature for this situation.  <br/> To find out whether Audio Conferencing is available in your country or region, see [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](/microsoftteams/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans). <br/> If you are looking for how much it costs, see [Requirements for Audio Conferencing](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/audio-conferencing).   |
|**Toll free numbers for dial-in access to your conferences, and the ability to dial out from a conference to add someone by calling any telephone number in the world**  |If you add Audio Conferencing, we recommend that you [Set up Communications Credits](/microsoftteams/set-up-communications-credits-for-your-organization).  |
|**Phone System**  |A PBX is a telephone system in a business. Phone System is a hosted telephone service. It gives you both traditional and innovative PBX capabilities, but without the complicated and expensive equipment. [Here's what you get with Phone System](/MicrosoftTeams/here-s-what-you-get-with-phone-system).  <br/> If you are looking for how much it costs, see [Requirements for Phone System](https://products.office.com/skype-for-business/cloud-pbx#requirements).   |
|**Calling Plans**  |Calls to other Skype for Business users are free, but if you want your users to be able to call any phone numbers outside of your business, get a [Calling Plan](/MicrosoftTeams/calling-plans-for-office-365). There are Domestic Calling Plans and Domestic and International Calling Plans.  <br/> If you are looking for how much it costs, see [Requirements for Calling Plans](https://products.office.com/skype-for-business/pstn-calling-plans#requirements).   |
|**Microsoft Teams Rooms**  |This isn't an add-on, but a feature that brings video, audio, and content sharing to conference rooms. See [Microsoft Teams Rooms](/MicrosoftTeams/rooms/rooms-licensing).   |

## How to see prices and buy add-on licenses
<a name="bkmk_how"> </a>

 **After you buy a Microsoft 365 plan, you see prices and buy add-ons through the Microsoft 365 admin center**.

Depending on the add-ons you want, we recommend [comparing whether it's more cost effective](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=844053) for you to switch to a plan that includes those features already.

See your plan under "License options based on your plan" for more details about which licenses to buy and how to see prices and purchase add-on licenses.

## How do I use my existing Calling Plans with Skype for Business?
<a name="bkmk_existing"></a>

If you want to use your existing Calling Plan, buy the **Phone System** add-on and use it with the **[free Cloud connector](../../SfbServer/skype-for-business-hybrid-solutions/plan-your-phone-system-cloud-pbx-solution/plan-skype-for-business-cloud-connector-edition.md)**.

If you are using on-premises PSTN connectivity for hybrid users, you  *only*  assign **Phone System** licenses to your users. **DO NOT** also assign a Calling Plan.
