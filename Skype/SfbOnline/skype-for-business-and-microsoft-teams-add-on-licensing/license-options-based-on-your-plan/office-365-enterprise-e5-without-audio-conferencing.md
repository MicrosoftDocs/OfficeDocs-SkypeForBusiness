# Office 365 Enterprise E5 (without Audio Conferencing)

If you have already purchased the Office 365 Enterprise E5 (without Audio Conferencing) plan, here are the Skype for Business add-on licenses you need to buy to get more features.

|||
|:-----|:-----|
|**To add this feature** <br/> |**Here's what you need to buy** <br/> |
|**Audio Conferencing** <br/> | To get this add-on, do the following: <br/><br/> 1. If you have already bought an E5 plan but the Audio Conferencing feature isn't available in your country or region, you will need to use a third-party audio conferencing provider. Find a third-party audio conferencing provider at [Microsoft PinPoint](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=797530).  <br/><br/>  Check this article to see if Audio Conferencing is available in your country or region: [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](/microsoftteams/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans) <br/><br/> 2. If it is available, use the  [Switch plans button](http://support.office.com/article/73318661-8f33-478b-bcc7-fb8d69dbb22a) to move to the Office 365 Enterprise E5 that includes it. You'll get more features, too! <br/> |
|**Phone System is included!** <br/> | Calling Plans: buy a [Calling Plan](/MicrosoftTeams/calling-plans-for-office-365) from Office 365. <br/>  Or, use the [telephone service from your existing provider](../../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md#bkmk_existing).  <br/> |
|**Cloud Voicemail is included!** <br/> |You don't need anything else.  <br/> |
