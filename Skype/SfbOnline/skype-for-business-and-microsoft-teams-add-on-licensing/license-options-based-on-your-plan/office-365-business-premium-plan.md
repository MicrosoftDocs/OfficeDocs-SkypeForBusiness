# Office 365 Business Premium

If you have [Office 365 Business Premium](https://products.office.com/en/business/office-365-business-premium), you can use Skype for Business to make calls to other people in your business who are on your subscription. For example, if your business has 10 people, you can call and IM each other using Skype for Business.

 **To make and receive calls from people external to your business, you have two options**:

- **Option 1. Use the free [Skype app](https://www.skype.com/)**. If you have a very small business (for example, 1-2 people), using the Skype app is the better way to go. It's less expensive to use for domestic and international calls. You can still hold conference calls, make video calls, and share your desktop for presentations. [Check out the rates and payment options](https://secure.skype.com/en/calling-rates?wt.mc_id=legacy&amp;expo365=bundled).

    Note that the Skype app isn't part of the Office 365 suite, so it won't be integrated with Outlook 2016 the way Skype for Business is. This means your contacts in Outlook 2016 won't show up in Skype; you'll need to add your contacts to Skype.

    We recommend starting with the Skype app to see if it meets your needs. If it doesn't, then consider the next option, to upgrade your plan.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You have to set a toggle to allow your employees to use Skype for Business to search for Skype users. See [Let Skype for Business users add Skype contacts](../../set-up-skype-for-business-online/let-skype-for-business-users-add-skype-contacts.md).


- **Option 2. Upgrade your plan, and buy a Phone System and a Domestic or Domestic and International Calling Plan**.

    > [!Important]
    > Although Skype for Business Online Plan 2 is included with the Office Business Premium subscription, **you can’t add cloud voice calling features**. So, we recommend that you evaluate an Enterprise E5 (or Enterprise E3) plan to see if it is more cost effective.

1. [Switch to a different Office 365 for business plan](https://support.office.com/article/73318661-8f33-478b-bcc7-fb8d69dbb22a). We recommend that you evaluate an Enterprise E5 plan to see if it is more cost effective.

2. Buy the **Phone System** add-on.
    
3. Buy a [Calling Plan for Office 365](/MicrosoftTeams/calling-plans-for-office-365): you can only buy this after you buy the **Phone System** add-on.
    
    This second option is ideal for businesses with several people who make and receive external phone calls.
