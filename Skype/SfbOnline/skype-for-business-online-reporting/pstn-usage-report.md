***
![Number 1](../images/sfbcallout1.png)<br/>The table shows you a breakdown of the all PSTN usage per user. This shows all users that have Skype for Business assigned to them and their PSTN usage. You can add/remove columns to the table.
*    **Call ID** is the call ID for a call. It is a unique identifier for the call that is used when calling Microsoft service support.
*    **User ID** is the user's sign in name.
*    **Phone number** is the Skype for Business phone number that received the call for inbound calls or the number dialed for outbound calls.
*    **User location** is the country/region where the user is located.
*    **Caller ID** is caller's telephone number (Caller ID) for inbound calls, the number from which the call originated or the Skype for Business number from which the call originated for outbound calls.
*    **Call type** is whether the call was a PSTN outgoing or incoming call and the type of call such as a call placed by a user or an audio conference. The call types you may see are: 

     **Calling Plan Call Types** 
     *    **user_in** (the user received an inbound PSTN call) 
     *    **user_out** (the user placed an outbound PSTN call) 
     *    **user_out_conf** (the user added 2 or more PSTN participants to the call such as a 3-way conference call) 
     *    **user_out_transfer** (the user transferred the call to a PSTN number) 
     *    **user_out_forwarding** (the user forwarded the call to a PSTN number)

     **Audio Conferencing Call Types**
     *    **conf_in** (an inbound call to the Audio Conferencing bridge)

     *    **ucap_out** (an outbound PSTN call from the UC application such as auto attendant or call queue)
     *    **Note:** Calls that were transferred to a user from the UC application such as an auto attendant or call queue will not appear in the PSTN usage report as these call legs are peer to peer (P2P) audio calls. You may access the P2P calls in the Skype for Business Admin Center under "Tools > Skype for Business Call Analytics" and search by User Name or SIP address correlating the call by date/time and/or originating CLID (calling line ID). 
*     
     **Domestic/International** tells you whether the call that was placed was considered domestic (within a country/region) or international (outside of a country/region) based on the user's location. 
*    **Destination dialed** is the name of the country/region destination that is dialed such as France, Germany, or the United States (U.S.). 
*    **Number type** is the type of phone number that is from a user's phone number, a service or toll-free number.  
*    **Start Time (UTC)** is the time that the call was started or placed. 
*    **Duration** is how long the call was connected.  
*    **ConfID** is the conference ID of the audio conference. 
*    **Charge** is the amount of money or cost of the call that is being charged to your account. 
*    **Currency** is the type of currency that is used to calculate the cost of the call. 
*    **Capability** is the license used for the call. The license types you may see are:

     *    **MCOPSTN2** - International Calling Plan 
     *    **MCOPSTN5** - Domestic Calling Plan (120 min calling plan) 
     *    **MCOPSTN6** - Domestic Calling Plan (240 min calling plan) Note: Limited Availability

![Number 3](../images/sfbcallout3.png)<br/>You can also export the report data into a TAB delimited Excel file, by clicking or tapping the **Export to Excel** button. <br/><br/> This exports data of all users and enables you to do simple sorting and filtering for further analysis. If you have less than 2000 users, you can sort and filter within the table in the report itself. 
    > [!Note] 
    > Despite the export file named as .CSV (which implies a comma delimited export), as there may be commas in the data set, the file is actually delimited with **TABS** and not **COMMAS**.
