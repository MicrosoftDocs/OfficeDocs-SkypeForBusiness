# Device usage report

The new Office 365 **Reports** dashboard shows you the activity overview across the Office 365 products in your organization. It enables you to drill in to individual product level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each product. For example, you can use the **Skype for Business device usage** report to see the devices, including Windows-based operating systems and mobile devices, that have the Skype for Business app installed and are using it for IM and meetings. 

Check out the [Reports overview](https://support.office.com/article/0d6dfb17-8582-4172-a9a9-aed798150263) to learn more.
  
This report, along with the other Skype for Business reports, gives you details on the types of clients/devices that are used across your organization. These details are very helpful when you are investigating, planning, and making other business decisions for your organization.
  
> [!NOTE]
> You can see all of the Skype for Business reports when you log on as an administrator to the Office 365 admin center.

***
![Number 1](../images/sfbcallout1.png)<br/>The **Skype for Business device usage** report can be viewed for trends over the last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or 180 days. However, if you click into a particular day in the report, the table (see number 7) will show data for 30 days, up to the date (see number 2) for when the report was generated.

> [!NOTE]
> If you click into the details of a specific day, the table will only show data for the 30 days up to the date when the report was generated.
    
***
![Number 2](../images/sfbcallout2.png)<br/>
Each report has a date for when this report was generated. The reports usually reflect a 24- to 48-hour latency from time of activity. 
***
![Number 3](../images/sfbcallout3.png)<br/>Use the interactive chart data on the **Users** chart to understand usage trends and to see the number of users that are connected using the Skype for Business app that are used in your organization. It will show you the total number of users and types of **Windows**, **Windows Phone**, **Android phone**, **iPhone**, and **iPad** devices that have the Skype for Business app installed and are being used across your organization.

For example, on the **Users** chart, click or tap **Windows**, **Windows Phone**, **Android phone**, **iPhone**, or **iPad** to see only the info related to each one. Changing this selection doesn't change the info in the grid table. 
***
![Number 6](../images/sfbcallout6.png)<br/>Each chart has an 'X' (horizontal) and 'Y' (vertical) axis.
*    On the **Users** chart, the Y axis is the total number of users connected with a device that has the Skype for Business app installed.
*    On the **Distribution** activity chart, the Y axis is the number of users that are connected with a certain type of device with the Skype for Business app installed. 

The X axis on both charts is the selected date range for this specific report.
***
![Number 7](../images/sfbcallout7.png)<br/>The table shows you a breakdown of the all conferencing activities per user. This shows all users that have Skype for Business assigned to them and their conferencing activities. You can add additional columns to the table.
*    **User name** is the name of the user. 
*    **Last activity date (UTC)** is the latest time the user engaged in a peer to peer session, or organized a conference or participated in a conference.
*    **Windows** is selected if the user is has the Skype for Business client app installed on a Windows-based operating system and is using it.

*    **Android phone** is selected if the user is has the Skype for Business client app installed on a Android phone and is using it.

If your organization's policies prevents you from viewing reports where user information is identifiable, you can change the privacy setting for all these reports. Check out the **How do I hide user level details?** section in the [Activity Reports in the Office 365 admin center](https://support.office.com/article/0d6dfb17-8582-4172-a9a9-aed798150263).

***
![Number 9](../images/sfbcallout9.png)<br/>You can also export the report data into an Excel .csv file, by clicking or tapping **Export**.           <br/> ![Skype for Business Reporting Export Button.](../images/de7e2ab7-d70c-422f-a0ec-178b10f7dd51.png)<br/>This exports data of all users and enables you to do simple sorting and filtering for further analysis.
