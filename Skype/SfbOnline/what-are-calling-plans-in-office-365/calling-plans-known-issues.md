# Calling Plans known issues

|Transitioning from Tech Preview licenses to production licenses for Calling Plans don't automatically update the license.  <br/> |Purchase your new licenses first so they are ready to be assigned to your users. Remove the promo (Tech Preview) license from a user, and then **IMMEDIATELY** assign the new **Domestic Calling Plan** and/or **Domestic and International Calling Plan** licenses to the user. <br/> If you are removing and adding licenses for multiple users, it is extremely important that you remove the licenses from all of the users using Windows PowerShell and then **IMMEDIATELY** assign the licenses for all of the users also using Windows PowerShell. Doing this will ensure that there is no disruption in service when handling large volumes of user license assignments. For sample PowerShell scripts, see [Assign Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams licenses](../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/assign-skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-licenses.md).  <br/> **Note:** If you are using on-premises PSTN connectivity for hybrid users, you  *only*  need to assign a **Phone System** license. You should **NOT** also assign a voice Calling Plan. However, if you are enabling Calling Plans in Office 365 for users that are in Office 365, you need to still assign a **Domestic Calling Plan** or a **Domestic and International Calling Plan** license for those users. See [Assign Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams licenses](../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/assign-skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-licenses.md).
