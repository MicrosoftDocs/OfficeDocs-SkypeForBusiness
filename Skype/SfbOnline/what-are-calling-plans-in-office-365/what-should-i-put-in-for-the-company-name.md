# What should I put in for the company name?

This is the name of your company or organization. The name of the company is limited to 25 characters, which includes spaces. The name of the company isn't used to process the port order request; it is used in the case of a dispute or if something is incorrect when the phone numbers are being ported over. If you can't fit the entire name of the company in the box, it won't delay or cancel the port order.
  
 **For complete step-by-step instructions, see [Transfer phone numbers to Office 365](/microsoftteams/transfer-phone-numbers-to-office-365).**
 
> [!NOTE]
> If you need to get more telephone numbers than this, please [contact support for business products - Admin Help](https://support.office.com/article/32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b)
