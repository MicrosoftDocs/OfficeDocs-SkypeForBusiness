# Assign or change an emergency address for a user

When you are setting up Calling Plans in Office 365, you will need to assign a phone number and emergency address to each of your users. The emergency address must be created before you can associate it with a phone number. See [What are emergency locations, addresses and call routing?](what-are-emergency-locations-addresses-and-call-routing.md) for more information.
  
Want to know how to get Calling Plans in Office 365 and how much they cost, see [Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md).
  
## Assign or change an emergency address

1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.
    
2. Go to the **Office 365 admin center** > **Skype for Business**.
    
3. In the left navigation go to **Voice**, then click **Voice users**.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For you to see the **Voice** option in the left navigation in the Skype for Business admin center, you must first buy at least one **Enterprise E5 license**, one **Phone System** add-on license, or one **Audio Conferencing** add-on license.
    
4. On the **Voice users** page, locate and select the user you want to change the emergency address for.
    
5. In the Action pane, under **Emergency location**, click **Change**.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > You can only change an emergency address that has already been validated. To change an emergency address that hasn't been validated, delete it and create another emergency address. 
  
6. On the **Assign number** page, click **Change location**.
    
7. Under **Change emergency address to**, enter the name of the city and click **Search**.
    
8. Select the emergency address from the address drop-down list, and then click **Save**.
