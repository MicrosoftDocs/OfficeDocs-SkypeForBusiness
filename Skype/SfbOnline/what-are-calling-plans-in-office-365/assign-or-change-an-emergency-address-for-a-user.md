# Assign or change an emergency address for a user

When you are setting up Calling Plans in Office 365, you will need to assign an emergency address to each phone number or user. In European countries, the emergency address is associated with the phone number when you get it from Office 365 or when you transfer a phone number over to Office 365. In the United States, the emergency address is associated with the phone number when it is assigned to the user. The emergency address can be changed if the user it is assigned to moves to a new location. For more about emergency addresses and locations, see [What are emergency locations, addresses and call routing?](/microsoftteams/what-are-emergency-locations-addresses-and-call-routing)
  
To learn how to get Calling Plans in Office 365 and how much they cost, see [Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md).
  
## Assign or change an emergency address

1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.
    
2. Go to the **Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business Admin Center** > **Legacy portal**.
    
3. In the left navigation go to **Voice**, then click **Voice users**.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For you to see the **Voice** option in the left navigation in the Skype for Business admin center, you must first buy at least one **Enterprise E5 license**, one **Phone System** add-on license, or one **Audio Conferencing** add-on license.
    
4. On the **Voice users** page, locate and select the user you want to change the emergency address for.
    
5. In the Action pane, under **Emergency location**, click **Change**.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You can only change an emergency address that has already been validated. To change an emergency address that hasn't been validated, delete it and create another emergency address. 
  
6. On the **Assign number** page, click **Change location**.
    
7. Under **Change emergency address to**, enter the name of the city and click **Search**.
    
8. Select the emergency address from the address drop-down list, and then click **Save**.
