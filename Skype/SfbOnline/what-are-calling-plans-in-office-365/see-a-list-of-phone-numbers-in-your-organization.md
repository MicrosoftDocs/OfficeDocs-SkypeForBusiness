When you are setting up users in your organization to make and receive phone calls, you must first get the phone numbers and then assign them to your users. After you've gotten your phone numbers, you might just want to see the list of the users that have phone numbers assigned to users, those that don't and whether a user is hosted Online or on-premises.
  
1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.
    
2. Go to the **Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business Admin Center** > **Legacy portal**.
    
3. In the **Skype for Business admin center**, in the left navigation, go to **Voice** > **Voice users**.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For you to see the **Voice** option in the left navigation in the Skype for Business admin center, you must first buy at least one **Enterprise E5 license**, one **Phone System** add-on license, or one **Audio Conferencing** add-on license.
    
4. You can use the drop-down list to filter your view for active users, whether the user is Online or on-premises, or the state and type of licensing for a user. You can filter by:
    
   - **Active users** and whether a user is Online or on-premises.
    
   - **Pending licenses** and whether a user is Online or on-premises.
