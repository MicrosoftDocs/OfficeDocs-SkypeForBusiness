# Why is number activation listed as updating?

Address validation is an important part of setting up Calling Plans in Office 365. If for some reason a phone number isn't activated and is listed as **updating** because of address validation, you will need to create and submit a service request. How you do this is based on the size of your organization.
  
## For organizations 150 or less follow these steps
1. In the **Office 365 admin center**, choose **Need help**?
2. In the **Need help?** pane, tell us what you need help with, then choose **Get help**.
3. If the results in the **View solutions** section don't help, choose one of the following:
    - **Let us call you (Recommended)**: Confirm your contact number, then press **Call me**. The expected wait time for a call back is indicated in the **Need help?** pane.
    - **Email us**: Confirm your email address, then choose **Send**. The call response time is indicated in the **Need help?** pane.

## For organizations with more than 150 users, create a service request to validate an emergency address

1. Sign in as an administrator to Office 365 with your work or school account.
    
2. In the Office 365 admin center, in the left navigation, click **Support** > **New service request**.

      - Country or region

     > **Put the country/region where we offer Calling Plans in Office 365 that you are trying to validate an emergency address in when you are assigning phone number.**
  
      - Postal or zip code
    
6. Click **Next** page, click **Yes, continue** to continue.
    
7. On the **Add details** page, select and enter the following:
    
   - **Is your service unavailable?** Select **No**.
    
   - **How many users are affected?** Select **Some users**.
