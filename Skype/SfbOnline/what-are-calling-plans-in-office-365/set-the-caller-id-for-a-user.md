# Set the Caller ID for a user
The Phone System in Office 365 provides a default caller ID that is the user's assigned telephone number. You can either change or block the caller ID (also called a Calling Line ID) for a user. You can learn more about how to use caller ID in your organization by going [How can caller ID be used in your organization](how-can-caller-id-be-used-in-your-organization.md).
  
> [!TIP]
> You can't block incoming calls currently in Skype for Business Online. 
  
There are settings that you can change:
  
> [!NOTE]
> This **is not** for on-premises organizations with Lync or Skype for Business Server.
  
- **Change their outgoing caller ID** You can replace a user's Caller ID, which by default is their telephone number, with another phone number. For example, you could change the user's Caller ID from their phone number to a main phone number for your business or change the user's Calling Line ID from their phone number to a main phone number for the legal department. You can change the Calling ID number to any Online **service** number (toll or toll-free).
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want to use the  _Service_ parameter, you must specify a valid service number.
  
- **Block their outbound caller ID** You can block the outgoing Caller ID from being sent on a user's outgoing PSTN calls. Doing this will block their phone number from being displayed on the phone of a person being called.
    
- **Block their incoming caller ID** You can block a user from receiving Caller ID on any incoming PSTN calls.
    
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Emergency calls will always send the user's telephone number (caller ID). 
  
By default, all of these caller ID settings are **turned off**. This means that the Skype for Business Online user's phone number can be seen when that user makes a call to a PSTN phone.
  
To learn more about these settings and how you can use them, go [How can caller ID be used in your organization](how-can-caller-id-be-used-in-your-organization.md).
  
## Set your caller ID policy settings

> [!NOTE]
> For all of the Caller ID settings in Skype for Business Online, you must use Windows PowerShell and you **can't use** the **Skype for Business admin center**. 
  
### Verify and start Windows PowerShell

- **Check that you are running Windows PowerShell version 3.0 or higher**
    
1. To verify that you are running version 3.0 or higher: **Start Menu** > **Windows PowerShell**.
    
2. Check the version by typing  _Get-Host_ in the **Windows PowerShell** window.
    
3. If you don't have version 3.0 or higher, you need to download and install updates to Windows PowerShell. See [Windows Management Framework 4.0 ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=716845) to download and update Windows PowerShell to version 4.0. Restart your computer when you are prompted.
    
4. You will also need to install the Windows PowerShell module for Skype for Business Online that enables you to create a remote Windows PowerShell session that connects to Skype for Business Online. This module, which is supported only on 64-bit computers, can be downloaded from the Microsoft Download Center at [Windows PowerShell Module for Skype for Business Online](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=294688). Restart your computer if you are prompted.
    
    If you need to know more, see [Connect to all Office 365 services in a single Windows PowerShell window](https://technet.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/dn568015.aspx).
    
- **Start a Windows PowerShell session**
    
1. From the **Start Menu** > **Windows PowerShell**.
    
2. In the **Windows PowerShell** window, connect to your Office 365 organization by running:
    
   > [!NOTE]
   > You only have to run the **Import-Module** command the first time you use the Skype for Business Online Windows PowerShell module.
   > 
   > ```
   > Import-Module "C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Skype for Business Online\\Modules\\SkypeOnlineConnector\\SkypeOnlineConnector.psd1"
   > ```
   > 
   > ```
   > $credential = Get-Credential
   > ```
   > 
   > ```
   > $session = New-CsOnlineSession -Credential $credential
   > ```
   > 
   > ```
   > Import-PSSession $session
   > ```

### See all of the caller ID policy settings in your organization

- To view all of the caller ID policy settings in your organization, run:

  See more examples and details for [Get-CsCallingLineIdentity](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt793856.aspx).
    
### Create a new caller ID policy for your organization


- To create a new caller ID policy that sets the caller ID to anonymous, run:
    
  ```
  New-CsCallingLineIdentity  -Identity Anonymous -Description "Anonymous policy" -CallingIDSubstitute Anonymous -EnableUserOverride $false

  > In all cases, the "Service Number" field should not include an initial "+".

- To apply the new policy you created to Amos Marble, run:
    
  ```
   Grant-CsCallingLineIdentity -Identity "amos.marble@contoso.com" -PolicyName Anonymous
  ```
  See more on the [Grant-CsCallingLineIdentity](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt793857.aspx) cmdlet.
    
If you have already created a policy, you can use the [Set-CsCallingLineIdentity](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt793854.aspx) cmdlet to make changes to the existing policy, and then use the [Grant-CsCallingLineIdentity](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt793857.aspx) cmdlet to apply the settings to your users.
  
### Set it so the incoming caller ID is blocked

- To block the incoming caller ID, run:
    
  ```
  Set-CsCallingLineIdentity  -Identity "Block Incoming" -BlockIncomingPstnCallerID $true -EnableUserOverride $true
  ```

- To apply the policy setting you created to a user in your organization, run:
    
  ```
  Grant-CsCallingLineIdentity -Identity "amos.marble@contoso.com" -PolicyName "Block Incoming"
  ```
    See more on the [Grant-CsCallingLineIdentity](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt793857.aspx) cmdlet.

```
Grant-CsCallingLineIdentity -Identity "amos.marble@contoso.com" -PolicyName $null
```
