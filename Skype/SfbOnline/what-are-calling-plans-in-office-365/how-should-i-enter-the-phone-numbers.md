# How should I enter the phone numbers?

When you are porting phone numbers, you must enter them in the correct format. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> Each phone number or range of phone number must be entered separately on each line. 
  
- When you are entering single phone numbers:
    
  - All special characters will be ignored (including dash "-"). For example:
    
  - For a 10-digit number: **&amp;\*(425\*()(\*&amp;4&amp;\*())(\*250649** will be corrected to **+14255550649**.
    
  - For an 11-digit number: **1\*()(\*&amp;42&amp;\*()(\*&amp;55550649** will be corrected to **+14255550649**.
    
  - All tags will be ignored if there are 10 or 11 digits. For example, **\<div> 4255551234\</div>** will be **+14255551234**.
    
  - "-", space, and parenthesis will be ignored. For example:
    
  - For a 10-digit number: **(425) 555-6776** will be corrected to **+14255556776**.
    
  - For an 11-digit number: **1(425) 555-6776** will be corrected to **+14255556776**.
    
  - All letters will be treated as special characters and ignored if there is a 10-digit or 11-digit phone number. For example:
    
  - For a 10-digit number: **14jaosia2reoij05jof55506ajfoj49isdjf** will be corrected to **+14255550649**.
    
  - For an 11-digit number: **1ade4jaoda2rfoij05ojof55506dsfoj49if** will be corrected to **+14255550649**.
    
  - Any combination of special characters, even in other languages, will be corrected. For example: 
    
  - For a 10-digit number: **中文4中文2ajj5\*（）（\*（5()...551345** will be corrected to **+14555551345**.
    
  - For an 11-digit number: **中文4中文2$a5\*（）（\*（5()...55(.1345** will be corrected to **+14555551345**.
    
  - If any numbers contain fewer than 10 digits or more than 11 digits, they will be highlighted for the user to correct:
    
  - \*\*5551245\*\* will be highlighted and need to be corrected.
    
  - **1234567891011** will be highlighted and need to be corrected.
    
  - Any numbers that are fewer than 10 digits or more than 11 digits, with any special characters, will be highlighted without being automatically corrected.
    
  - For a 7-digit number without special characters that is entered: **123456abcdefg7** will be highlighted and need to be corrected, but the letters won't be ignored.
    
  - For a 7-digit number with special characters that is entered: **12345!@#$%^&amp;\*()--@#$%^&amp;\*()7** will be highlighted to be corrected. The special characters won't be ignored.
    
- When you are entering a range of phone numbers.
    
  - Only two phone numbers are allowed. The smaller number must be the first number in the range.
    
  - All special characters (except for the dash "-") are treated the same as single numbers. For example, **(425)555 0&amp;\*(123-(1425)5557899nm** will be corrected to **+14255550123 -+13202040659**.
    
  - The "-" is used for only separating the two numbers. It isn't supported to include multiple "-" in the number range. For example, **(425) 555-0649 - (425) 555-1115** should be entered as **(425) 5550649 - (425) 5551115**.
