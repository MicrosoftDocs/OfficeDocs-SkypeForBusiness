# Set your PIN for transferring numbers to a new service provider

To transfer or  *port out*  phone numbers from Skype for Business Online to another telephone service provider or carrier, you will need to manually set a PIN. After you set the PIN, you need to include it when you request to port a phone number out. 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> A port out PIN is only used for organizations in the United States. 
  
See [Transfer phone numbers to Office 365](/microsoftteams/transfer-phone-numbers-to-office-365) for more information about transferring and porting in/out phone numbers.
  
Here is some specific information about this PIN you should know:
  
- If a PIN isn't set, you won't be able to transfer or port out phone numbers from Skype for Business Online.
    
- It can contain 6-10 digits (numbers).
    
- It can't contain letters or special characters.
    
- The default PIN is blank, but if you put one in, you can't remove or set it back to blank.
    
- You can update or change the PIN after you put one in.
