# Assign or change the emergency location for a user

Each active phone number must have an associated emergency address when you assign the phone number to a user. (You associate the address when you get a phone number in Office 365 or when you transfer a phone number.) When you associate the number with an emergency address, you can also add an emergency location to provide a more exact location within a physical location. An emergency location can be the floor, building wing, or office number where the user is located. You can have an unlimited number of locations for a given emergency address, and you can change the emergency location if the user moves to a different office or buildingâ€”for example, if the user moves from floor 34 to floor 35.
  
To learn how to get Calling Plans in Office 365 and how much they cost, see [Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md).
  
## Assign or change the emergency location

1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.
    
2. Go to the **Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business Admin Center** > **Legacy portal**.
    
3. In the left navigation go to **Voice** > **Voice users**.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For you to see the **Voice** option in the left navigation in the Skype for Business admin center, you must first buy at least one **Enterprise E5 license**, one **Phone System** add-on license, or one **Audio Conferencing** add-on license.
    
4. On the **Voice users** page, locate and select the user you want to change the emergency location for.
    
5. In the Action pane, under **Emergency location**, click **Change**.
    
6. On the **Assign number** page, click **Change location**. 
    
7. Under **Change emergency address to**, enter the name of the city in the box and click **Search**.

8. Select **Search by location** from the drop-down list, enter a partial name for the location (for example, enter **floor**), and then click **Search**. 
    
8. Select the emergency location from the list, and then click **Save**.
    
    If you want to add a new emergency location that will appear on the list, see [Add, change, or remove an emergency location for your organization](add-change-or-remove-an-emergency-location-for-your-organization.md).
