# Assign or change the emergency location for a user

Each active phone number must have an associated emergency address when you assign the phone number to a user. (You associate the address when you get a phone number in Office 365 or when you transfer a phone number.) When you associate the number with an emergency address, you can also add an emergency location to provide a more exact location within a physical location. An emergency location can be the floor, building wing, or office number where the user is located. You can have an unlimited number of locations for a given emergency address, and you can change the emergency location if the user moves to a different office or building—for example, if the user moves from floor 34 to floor 35.
  
To learn how to get Calling Plans in Office 365 and how much they cost, see [Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md).
  
## Assign or change the emergency location

1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.
    
2. Go to the **Microsoft Teams admin center** > **Legacy portal**.
    
3. In the left navigation go to **Voice** > **Voice users**.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For you to see the **Voice** option in the left navigation in the Skype for Business admin center, you must first buy at least one **Enterprise E5 license**, one **Phone System** add-on license, or one **Audio Conferencing** add-on license.
    
4. On the **Voice users** page, locate and select the user you want to change the emergency location for.
    
5. In the Action pane, under **Emergency location**, click **Change**.
    
6. On the **Assign number** page, click **Change location**. 
    
7. Under **Change emergency address to**, enter the name of the city in the box and click **Search**.

8. Select **Search by location** from the drop-down list, enter a partial name for the location (for example, enter **floor**), and then click **Search**. 
    
8. Select the emergency location from the list, and then click **Save**.
    
    If you want to add a new emergency location that will appear on the list, see [Add, change, or remove an emergency location for your organization](add-change-or-remove-an-emergency-location-for-your-organization.md).
