# Add, change, or remove an emergency address for your organization

An emergency address must be associated with a phone number - but when this happens can vary between country/regions. For example, in the United States, you need to associate an emergency address when you assign the phone number to the user. In the United Kingdom, you need to associate an emergency address to the phone number when you are getting the phone numbers from Office 365 or transferring phone numbers from your current service provider.
  
No matter which country/region you are in, it's possible to add a location or locations to an emergency address or remove an emergency address. Depending on the number of physical locations in your organization, you can create them for buildings, floors, and offices. See [What are emergency locations, addresses, and call routing?](/microsoftteams/what-are-emergency-locations-addresses-and-call-routing) for some details.

## To add an emergency address

1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account.
    
2. Go to the **Microsoft Teams & Skype for Business Admin Center** > **Legacy portal**.
    
3. In the left navigation, go to **Voice** > **Emergency locations**, and then click the **Add new address** button.
    
    > [!Important]
    > For you to see the **Voice** option in the left navigation in the Skype for Business admin center, you must first buy at least one **Enterprise E5 license**, one **Phone System** add-on license, or one **Audio Conferencing** add-on license.
    
4. In the Action pane, under **New Address**, enter the required information in the boxes.
    
5. After you enter all of the information for the address, click **Validate**.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Validating a street or civic address involves making sure that it is legitimate and correctly formatted. It is possible that a partially correct emergency address, such as if you mistyped the name of the city, may still pass validation. Even though it's misspelled and passed validation, the combination of the misspelled name of city along with the other correct parts of the address are enough information to route the call to the appropriate emergency dispatch center. 
  
    If the address can't be validated, you can send a manual validation request by clicking **Send a validation request** if you are trying to validate a U.S. address, or click **Open a service request to get help with address validation** if you are outside the United States.
    
6. After the address is validated, click **Save**.
