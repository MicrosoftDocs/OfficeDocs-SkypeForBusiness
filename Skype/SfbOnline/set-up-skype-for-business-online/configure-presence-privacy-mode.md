# Configure presence privacy mode

[!INCLUDE [sfbo-retirement](../../Hub/includes/sfbo-retirement.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Microsoft Teams admin center has replaced the Skype for Business admin center (Legacy portal). All settings for managing Skype for Business are now in the Teams admin center. You must be assigned the [Azure AD admin role](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference) of Global admin or Skype for Business admin to manage Skype for Business features in the Teams admin center. To learn more, see [Manage Skype for Business settings in the Microsoft Teams admin center](/MicrosoftTeams/skype-for-business-settings?bc=%2fskypeforbusiness%2fbreadcrumb%2ftoc.json&toc=%2fskypeforbusiness%2fsfbotoc%2ftoc.json).

The Skype for Business Online presence setting gives people more control over who can see whether they are available, in a meeting, or out of the office. For details about Skype for Business presence and privacy settings, see [Configure presence in Skype for Business Online](configure-presence-in-skype-for-business-online.md). 
  
## Choose the default online presence setting for everyone in your organization
