# Configure presence privacy mode

The Skype for Business Online presence setting gives people more control over who can see whether they are available, in a meeting, or out of the office. For details about Skype for Business presence and privacy settings, see [Configure presence in Skype for Business Online](configure-presence-in-skype-for-business-online.md).
