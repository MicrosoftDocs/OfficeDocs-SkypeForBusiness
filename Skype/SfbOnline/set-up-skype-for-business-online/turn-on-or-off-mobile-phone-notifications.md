# Turn on or off mobile phone notifications

As the **[Assign admin roles in Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/article/eac4d046-1afd-4f1a-85fc-8219c79e1504)** for your organization, you can choose whether your Skype for Business users receive alerts about incoming and missed instant messages when they are on their mobile phones or tablets.
  
On Android and Windows Phones, Skype for Business notifications pop up in real time. For Windows Phone, iPhone, and iPad devices, however, push notification is used to show the alerts whenever you're not actively using Skype for Business on your phone or tablet.
  
## Turn push notifications off for all the Windows Phone or Apple devices in your organization

![sfb-logo-30x30.png](../images/sfb-logo-30x30.png) **Using the Skype for Business admin center**

1. Sign in to Office 365.
    
2. Go to the **Office 365 admin center** > **Skype for Business**.
    
3. Go to **Organization** > **General**. 
    
4. Under **Mobile phone notifications**, clear the box next to the notification service you want to disable, and then click **Save**.
    
Keep in mind: 
  
- If you turn off push notifications, users still receive all alerts when they start up Skype for Business again on their mobile device.
    
- Push notifications are turned on by default. Individual users can turn them off by choosing the appropriate Skype for Business option on their mobile device.
    
- When you turn off push notifications, users can't turn them back on.
    
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Microsoft uses other companies to provide real-time Skype for Business mobile notifications for Windows Phone, iPhone, and iPad users. See the [Privacy Statement for Microsoft Skype for Business Products](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=247732).
