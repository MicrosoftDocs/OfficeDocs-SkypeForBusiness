# Customize meeting invitations

As an admin, you can ensure that all Skype for Business meeting invitations include some helpful information your users might need, such as links to your support website and legal disclaimer, your company logo, and other text you want to include.

2. Save the image in JPG format.
    
3. Store the image in a central location that everyone in your business can access, such as a network share, shared OneDrive for Business folder, Dropbox, etc.
