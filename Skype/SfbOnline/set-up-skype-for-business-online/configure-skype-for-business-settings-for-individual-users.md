# Admins: Configure Skype for Business settings for individual users

This article explains how admins configure Skype for Business for a small number of users. To do these steps in bulk, we've included links to the Windows PowerShell cmdlets you can use.
  
To allow (or block) everyone in your business to communicate with external people, see:
  
- [Allow users to contact external Skype for Business users](allow-users-to-contact-external-skype-for-business-users.md): You can let your organization use advanced Skype for Business features (share desktops, look for who's online, etc.) to communicate with people in a specific trusted (federated) business. The article also explains how to block communication with specific domains.
    
- [Let Skype for Business users add Skype contacts](let-skype-for-business-users-add-skype-contacts.md). You can let your organization use Skype for Business to search for and IM people who use Skype, the free app.
