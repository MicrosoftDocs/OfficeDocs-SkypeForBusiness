# Turn on or off Skype for Business client feedback reporting

You can enable your Skype for Business Online users to use the built-in Skype for Business app feedback tool to let users report issues and provide feedback directly to Microsoft about their experience.

Using this tool, a user can copy the logs from the app on their device to help Microsoft better investigate and troubleshoot problems that they might have.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The logs collected by the app's feedback tool will be stored for up to a maximum of 90 days in the United States while the issue is being investigated. Because of this, please don't enable this feedback tool if this violates your organization's data protection policy. 
  
## Verify and start Windows PowerShell

- **Check that you are running Windows PowerShell version 3.0 or higher**
    
1. To verify that you are running version 3.0 or higher: **Start Menu** > **Windows PowerShell**.
    
2. Check the version by typing  _Get-Host_ in the **Windows PowerShell** window.
    
3. If you don't have version 3.0 or higher, you need to download and install updates to Windows PowerShell. See [Windows Management Framework 4.0 ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=716845) to download and update Windows PowerShell to version 4.0. Restart your computer when you are prompted.
    
4. You will also need to install the Windows PowerShell module for Skype for Business Online that enables you to create a remote Windows PowerShell session that connects to Skype for Business Online. This module, which is supported only on 64-bit computers, can be downloaded from the Microsoft Download Center at [Windows PowerShell Module for Skype for Business Online](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=294688). Restart your computer if you are prompted.
    
If you need to know more, see [Connect to all Office 365 services in a single Windows PowerShell window](https://technet.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/dn568015.aspx).
    
- **Start a Windows PowerShell session**
    
1. From the **Start Menu** > **Windows PowerShell**.
    
2. In the **Windows PowerShell** window, connect to your Office 365 organization by running:
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > You only have to run the **Import-Module** command the first time you use the Skype for Business Online Windows PowerShell module.
 
   ```
    Import-Module "C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Skype for Business Online\\Modules\\SkypeOnlineConnector\\SkypeOnlineConnector.psd1"
    $credential = Get-Credential
    $session = New-CsOnlineSession -Credential $credential
    Import-PSSession $session
   ```
