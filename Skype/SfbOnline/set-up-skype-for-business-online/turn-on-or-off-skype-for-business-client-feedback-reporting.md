# Turn on or off Skype for Business client feedback reporting

[!INCLUDE [sfbo-retirement](../../Hub/includes/sfbo-retirement.md)]

You can enable your Skype for Business Online users to use the built-in Skype for Business app feedback tool to let users report issues and provide feedback directly to Microsoft about their experience. 
  
![Provide Feedback icon.](../images/eac13837-04d9-4da1-8e80-54612cf6650d.png)
  
Using this tool, a user can copy the logs from the app on their device to help Microsoft better investigate and troubleshoot problems that they might have. 
  
![Report a problem using Settings icon.](../images/2dfb5603-1d69-41fc-a43e-91a3379acbe0.png)
  
You can also use the  _EnableOnlineFeedbackScreenshot_ setting so users can include a screenshot of their device as a part of their feedback.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The logs collected by the app's feedback tool will be stored for up to a maximum of 90 days in the United States while the issue is being investigated. Because of this, please don't enable this feedback tool if this violates your organization's data protection policy. 
  
## Start Windows PowerShell

> [!NOTE]
> Skype for Business Online Connector is currently part of the latest Teams PowerShell module. If you're using the latest Teams PowerShell public release, you don't need to install the Skype for Business Online Connector.
1. Install the [Teams PowerShell module](/microsoftteams/teams-powershell-install).
    
2. Open a Windows PowerShell command prompt and run the following commands: 

   ```powershell
   # When using Teams PowerShell Module

   Import-Module MicrosoftTeams
   $userCredential = Get-Credential
   Connect-MicrosoftTeams -Credential $userCredential
   ```
   If you want more information about starting Windows PowerShell, see [Connect to all Microsoft 365 or Office 365 services in a single Windows PowerShell window](/microsoft-365/enterprise/connect-to-all-microsoft-365-services-in-a-single-windows-powershell-window) or [Set up your computer for Windows PowerShell](../set-up-your-computer-for-windows-powershell/set-up-your-computer-for-windows-powershell.md).
   
## Turn on client app feedback reporting for all the users in your organization

To enable feedback reporting for users in your organization and allow them to submit device screenshots, run:
 
  ```PowerShell
  Set-CsClientPolicy -Identity EnableOnlineFeedback -EnableOnlineFeedback $true -EnableOnlineFeedbackScreenshots $true
  ```
