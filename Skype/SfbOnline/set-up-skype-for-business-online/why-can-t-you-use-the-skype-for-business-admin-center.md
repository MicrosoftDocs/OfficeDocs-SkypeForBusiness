# Why can't I use the Skype for Business Online admin center right now?

We know it's frustrating when you can't get your work done, so we're going to explain what's happening here and why it'll be worth the wait. 
  
First, here's the technical explanation:
  
We're migrating your Skype for Business Online service (meaning your users and organizational settings) to another Microsoft datacenter that's closer to you. This will improve your service and reduce latency. 
  
For more technical details, see [During and after your data move]( https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=526418).
  
## OK, so what does that mean?

First, let's break down a few terms.
  
- **Data center** This is the physical location where the information from your Office 365 organization is stored, such as your files and email messages. If you really want to dig in to what Office 365 datacenters are, check out[this article](https://www.microsoft.com/online/legal/v2/?docid=25).
    
- **Migrating** This is pretty much the same as "moving." In this case, it means we're moving your Skype for Business Online users and settings from one datacenter to another that's closer to you to improve your service.
    
- **Latency** This is amount of time it takes you to access the Office 365 admin center, make a settings change, and then save those changes.
    
- **Correlation ID** You might have seen this listed in the message you just came from. This information is used by Microsoft support engineers to help you troubleshoot an error. If you contact Microsoft support, you might be asked for the Correlation ID.
    
So what this all means is we're in the process of moving all your Skype for Business Online users and service settings to another location that's closer to you. The closer the better. The good news is that after this short period of time, your Skype for Business Online service will improve.

## What Skype for Business Online features will still work?

Although you won't be able to access the Skype for Business Online admin center, the following Skype for Business Online features will still work during the migration:
  
- Online meetings
    
- Presence information
    
## Can I get other work done?

Sure. While we're migrating your Skype for Business Online service, you can still use the other admin centers in Office 365 (for example, the Office 365 and Exchange admin centers). However, along with the Skype for Business Online admin center, you won't be able to use the Skype for Business Online Remote PowerShell cmdlets during the migration.
