# Turn on or off allowing content to be preloaded for meetings using Outlook

Users can preload content, files, or attachments that are attached to an Outlook meeting invitation to a Skype for Business Online meeting, but you can it turn on or off. It's turned on by default for all organizations that are using Skype for Business Online. See how to [Preload attachments for a Skype for Business meeting](https://support.office.com/article/fd3d9f9d-b448-4754-b813-02e49393f251).
  
> [!NOTE]
> Currently, there are no cmdlets available in Skype for Business Online for setting or viewing online values for  _MaxContentStorageMB_ and _MaxUploadFileMB_. They are only available for on-premises deployments. It's important to know that content won't be uploaded to a meeting if the attached content exceeds the  _MaxUploadFileSizeMB_ or if the _MaxContentStorageMB_ limit is reached.
  
## To get you started

### 

 **Check that you are running Windows PowerShell version 3.0 or higher**
  
1. To verify that you are running version 3.0 or higher: **Start Menu** > **Windows PowerShell**.
    
2. Check the version by typing  _Get-Host_ in the **Windows PowerShell** window.
    
3. If you don't have version 3.0 or higher, you need to download and install updates to Windows PowerShell. See [Windows Management Framework 4.0 ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=716845) to download and update Windows PowerShell to version 4.0. Restart your computer when you are prompted.
    
4. You will also need to install the Windows PowerShell module for Skype for Business Online that enables you to create a remote Windows PowerShell session that connects to Skype for Business Online. This module, which is supported only on 64-bit computers, can be downloaded from the Microsoft Download Center at [Windows PowerShell Module for Skype for Business Online](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=294688). Restart your computer if you are prompted.
    
If you need to know more, see [Connect to all Office 365 services in a single Windows PowerShell window](https://technet.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/dn568015.aspx).
  
### 

 **Start a Windows PowerShell session**
  
1. From the **Start Menu** > **Windows PowerShell**.
    
2. In the **Windows PowerShell** window, connect to your Office 365 organization by running:
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > You only have to run the **Import-Module** command the first time you use the Skype for Business Online Windows PowerShell module.
  
```
Import-Module "C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Skype for Business Online\\Modules\\SkypeOnlineConnector\\SkypeOnlineConnector.psd1"
$credential = Get-Credential
$session = New-CsOnlineSession -Credential $credential
Import-PSSession $session
```

## Turning it on or off

Being able to preload content attached to an Outlook meeting invitation to Skype for Business Online meetings is turned on by default, but you may need to prevent users in your organization from preloading content in their meetings.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This setting can only be turned on or off for your entire organization; you can't turn it on or off for a single user. 
  
 **To turn it off, open Windows PowerShell and do the following:**
  
```
Grant-CsGraphPolicy -PolicyName GraphDisabled 
```

 **If you want to turn it back on, open Windows PowerShell and do the following:**
  
```
Grant-CsGraphPolicy -PolicyName GraphEnabled 
```
