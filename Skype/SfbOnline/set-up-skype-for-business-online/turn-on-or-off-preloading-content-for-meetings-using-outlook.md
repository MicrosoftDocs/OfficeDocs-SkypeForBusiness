# Turn on or off allowing content to be preloaded for meetings using Outlook

[!INCLUDE [sfbo-retirement](../../Hub/includes/sfbo-retirement.md)]

Users can preload content, files, or attachments that are attached to an Outlook meeting invitation to a Skype for Business Online meeting, but you can it turn on or off. It's turned on by default for all organizations that are using Skype for Business Online. See how to [Preload attachments for a Skype for Business meeting](https://support.office.com/article/fd3d9f9d-b448-4754-b813-02e49393f251).
  
> [!NOTE]
> Currently, there are no cmdlets available in Skype for Business Online for setting or viewing online values for  _MaxContentStorageMB_ and _MaxUploadFileMB_. They are only available for on-premises deployments. It's important to know that content won't be uploaded to a meeting if the attached content exceeds the  _MaxUploadFileSizeMB_ or if the _MaxContentStorageMB_ limit is reached.
  
## To get you started

## Start Windows PowerShell

> [!NOTE]
> Skype for Business Online Connector is currently part of the latest Teams PowerShell module. If you're using the latest Teams PowerShell public release, you don't need to install the Skype for Business Online Connector.
1. Install the [Teams PowerShell module](/microsoftteams/teams-powershell-install).
    
2. Open a Windows PowerShell command prompt and run the following commands: 

   ```powershell
   # When using Teams PowerShell Module

   Import-Module MicrosoftTeams
   $userCredential = Get-Credential
   Connect-MicrosoftTeams -Credential $userCredential
   ```

If you want more information about starting Windows PowerShell, see [Connect to all Microsoft 365 or Office 365 services in a single Windows PowerShell window](/microsoft-365/enterprise/connect-to-all-microsoft-365-services-in-a-single-windows-powershell-window) or [Set up your computer for Windows PowerShell](../set-up-your-computer-for-windows-powershell/set-up-your-computer-for-windows-powershell.md).
  
## Turning it on or off

Being able to preload content attached to an Outlook meeting invitation to Skype for Business Online meetings is turned on by default, but you may need to prevent users in your organization from preloading content in their meetings.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This setting can only be turned on or off for your entire organization; you can't turn it on or off for a single user. 
  
 **To turn it off, open Windows PowerShell and do the following:**
  
```PowerShell
Grant-CsGraphPolicy -PolicyName GraphDisabled 
```

 **If you want to turn it back on, open Windows PowerShell and do the following:**
  
```PowerShell
Grant-CsGraphPolicy -PolicyName GraphEnabled 
```
