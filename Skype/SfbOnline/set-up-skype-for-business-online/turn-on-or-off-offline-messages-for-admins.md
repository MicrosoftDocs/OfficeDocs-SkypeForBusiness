# Turn on or off Offline Messages for admins

[!INCLUDE [sfbo-retirement](../../Hub/includes/sfbo-retirement.md)]

You can send Skype for Business IMs to your contacts even if they aren't signed in. This feature lets your contacts know that you have been trying to reach them. You don't have to wait until someone is online before sending them a message.

For Offline messages, it's important to know:

- Offline messages won't be archived in the user's mailbox.

- Offline messages will be sent to the user's mailbox, and the user will be notified when they log in to Skype for Business.

- If the message recipient's status is set to **Do Not Disturb** or **Presenting**, they will receive a missed message that is sent from the recipient's Skype for Business client.

For more information, see [Use offline messaging in Skype for Business](https://support.office.com/article/ffdc6a43-71a1-40ee-bfcc-640d21324a3d).

## Turning on or off Offline IM

> [!NOTE]

  Set-CsClientPolicy -Identity OfflineIM -EnableIMAutoArchiving $False
  Grant -CsClientPolicy -Identity "Tony Smith" - PolicyName OfflineIM
