# Turn on or off Offline Messages for admins

You can send Skype for Business IMs to your contacts even if they aren't signed in. This feature lets your contacts know that you have been trying to reach them. You don't have to wait until someone is online before sending them a message.

For Offline messages, it's important to know:

- Offline messages won't be archived in the user's mailbox.

- Offline messages will be sent to the user's mailbox, and the user will be notified when they log in to Skype for Business.

- If the message recipient's status is set to **Do Not Disturb** or **Presenting**, they will receive a missed message that is sent from the recipient's Skype for Business client.

For more information, see [Use offline messaging in Skype for Business](https://support.office.com/article/ffdc6a43-71a1-40ee-bfcc-640d21324a3d).

## To get you started

## #

 **Check that you are running Windows PowerShell version 3.0 or higher**

1. To verify that you are running version 3.0 or higher: **Start Menu** > **Windows PowerShell**.

2. Check the version by typing  _Get-Host_ in the **Windows PowerShell** window.

3. If you don't have version 3.0 or higher, you need to download and install updates to Windows PowerShell. See [Windows Management Framework 4.0 ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=716845) to download and update Windows PowerShell to version 4.0. Restart your computer when you are prompted.

4. You will also need to install the Windows PowerShell module for Skype for Business Online that enables you to create a remote Windows PowerShell session that connects to Skype for Business Online. This module, which is supported only on 64-bit computers, can be downloaded from the Microsoft Download Center at [Windows PowerShell Module for Skype for Business Online](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=294688). Restart your computer if you are prompted.

If you need to know more, see [Connect to all Office 365 services in a single Windows PowerShell window](https://technet.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/dn568015.aspx).

 **Start a Windows PowerShell session**

1. From the **Start Menu** > **Windows PowerShell**.

2. In the **Windows PowerShell** window, connect to your Office 365 organization by running:

    > [!NOTE]
    > You only have to run the **Import-Module** command the first time you use the Skype for Business Online Windows PowerShell module.

>
  ```
  Import-Module "C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Skype for Business Online\\Modules\\SkypeOnlineConnector\\SkypeOnlineConnector.psd1"
  $credential = Get-Credential
  $session = New-CsOnlineSession -Credential $credential
  Import-PSSession $session
  ```

## Turning on or off Offline IM

> [!NOTE]
> Offline Messages are **only** available in the latest version of the Click-to-Run Skype for Business client and aren't available when an older Click-to-Run Skype for Business is used or an *.msi file was used to install the Skype for Business client.

To enable or disable Offline Messages send Offline Messages for users in your organization, set  _EnableIMAutoArchiving_ to `True` or `False`. By default, this is set to `True`.

To turn it off, use the **Set-CsClientPolicy** cmdlet and run:

```
Set-CsClientPolicy -Identity Global -EnableIMAutoArchiving $False
```

To enable or disable Offline Messages send Offline Messages for a user, set  _EnableIMAutoArchiving_ to `True` or `False`. By default, this is set to  `True`. You can use an existing policy or create one like the example below.


  ```
  New-CsClientPolicy -Identity OfflineIM
  Set-CsClientPolicy -Identity OfflineIM -EnableIMAutoArchiving $False
  Grant -CsClientPolicy -Identity "Tony Smith" - PolicyName OfflineIM
  ```
