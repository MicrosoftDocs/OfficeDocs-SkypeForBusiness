# Compare audio conferencing providers

When you set up Audio Conferencing for Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams, you need to choose an audio conferencing provider. You can choose either Microsoft or a third party as your audio conferencing provider. 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Teams users can't use a third-party audio conferencing provider. 
  
Audio conferencing providers do the following: 
  
- Provide an *audio conferencing bridge*. The conferencing bridge will set dial-in phone numbers, PINs, and conference IDs for meetings.
    
- Give toll, toll-free, and international phone numbers that users will dial in to. These are the phone numbers included in the meeting invite.
    
- Set the language that users will hear when they dial in to a meeting.
    
- Create meeting conference IDs that are used when users are joining a meeting.
    
- Give you the organizer PIN to start meetings over the phone.
    
Use the following table to compare what you get if you choose Microsoft or a third-party audio conferencing provider.
