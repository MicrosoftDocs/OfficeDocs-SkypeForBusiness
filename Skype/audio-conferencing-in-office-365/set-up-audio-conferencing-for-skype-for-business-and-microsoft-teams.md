# Set up Audio Conferencing for Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams

Sometimes people in your organization will need to use a phone to call in to a meeting. Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams include the audio conferencing feature for just this situation! People can call in to Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams meetings using a phone, instead of using the Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams app on a mobile device or PC. 
  
You only need to set up Audio Conferencing for people who plan to schedule or lead meetings. Meeting attendees who dial in don't need any licenses assigned to them or other setup.
  
For frequently asked questions about Audio Conferencing, see [Audio Conferencing common questions](audio-conferencing-common-questions.md).
  
## Step 1: Buy and assign licenses
<a name="__top"> </a>

You must be an [About Office 365 admin roles](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/da585eea-f576-4f55-a1e0-87090b6aaa9d%28Office.14%29.aspx) to perform this step.
  
1. Find out if Audio Conferencing in Office 365 is available in your country/region. [Countries and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](../countries-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/countries-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md). 
    
2. Learn which licenses you need to buy for Audio Conferencing, and how much they will cost. See [Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md), and buy the licenses. 
    
3. [Assign or remove licenses for Office 365 for business](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc%28Office.14%29.aspx) you purchased to the people in your organization who are going to schedule or lead meetings.
    
4. If you purchased **Audio Conferencing** add-on licenses and Communications Credits licenses, assign them too. For instructions, see[Assign Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams licenses](../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/assign-skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-licenses.md).
    
## Step 2: Decide on your audio conferencing provider
<a name="__top"> </a>

An audio conferencing provider supplies an  *audio conferencing bridge*  . The conferencing bridge sets your dial-in phone numbers, PINs, and conference IDs for meetings. Decide whether to use Microsoft or a third-party audio conferencing provider:
  
> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Teams users can't user a third-party audio conferencing provider. 
  
- **Microsoft as your audio conferencing provider**: If you want the easiest solution for audio conferencing, choose Microsoft as your audio conferencing provider.
    
- **Third party as your audio conferencing provider**: If you are in a country where Audio Conferencing in Office 365 isn't available, the service quality isn't great because of its location, or you have an existing contract, choose a third-party audio conferencing provider. To find a provider, go to **[Microsoft PinPoint](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=797530)**.
    
> [!TIP]
> In your organization, you can have some people who use Microsoft as their audio conferencing provider, and others who use a third-party provider. But this will be more complicated for you to set up and manage. 
  
For a detailed comparison between Microsoft as your audio provider and a third-party provider, see [Compare audio conferencing providers](compare-audio-conferencing-providers.md). 
  
## Step 3: Assign the audio conferencing provider to people who lead or schedule meetings
<a name="__top"> </a>

Now that you've decided on your audio conferencing provider, you need to assign the provider to people in your organization who lead or schedule meetings. Do one of the following: 
  
- [Assign Microsoft as the audio conferencing provider](assign-microsoft-as-the-audio-conferencing-provider.md) .
    
- [Assign a third-party as the audio conferencing provider](assign-a-third-party-as-the-audio-conferencing-provider.md) .
    
## Step 4: Set up meeting invitations
<a name="__top"> </a>

The following steps are **optional**, but a lot of admins like to do them:
  
1. [Customize meeting invitations](../set-up-skype-for-business-online/customize-meeting-invitations.md) . The dial-in numbers that are set for the user will be automatically added to the meeting invitations that are sent to attendees. However, you can add your own help and legal links, a text message, and small company graphic.
    
2. [Set the Audio Conferencing phone numbers for meeting organizers that are included on invites](set-the-audio-conferencing-phone-numbers-for-meeting-organizers-that-are-include.md) . This is the phone number that will show up in the meeting that is scheduled by the user.
    
3. [Set auto attendant languages for Audio Conferencing](set-auto-attendant-languages-for-audio-conferencing.md) that the audio conferencing auto attendant uses to greet a caller when they dial in to an Audio Conferencing phone number. This step only applies if you're using Microsoft as your audio provider.
    
4. [Set the length of the PIN for Audio Conferencing meetings](set-the-length-of-the-pin-for-audio-conferencing-meetings.md) .
